      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The jobs crisis continues with news of proposals for 250 job losses in <i>The Irish Times</i> and 100 job losses in Waterford Wedgewood. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated yesterday that he has no idea where the money has gone and cannot explain the reduction in receipts from income tax, VAT and excise duties even though, as he says, people seem to be drinking and smoking as much as ever. Does the Taoiseach think this is the man who should introduce a budget in a month's time when he has no idea what is happening to the flow of revenue and has to base a budget on the flow of revenue expected in 2002?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow a supplementary question from Deputy Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach indicated in the House that the Government intended to have a budget surplus, including next year. In light of the massive economic downturn, will he indicate what cuts he proposes to introduce in current and capital public expenditure to achieve this surplus? When will those cuts be made public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>More job losses have been announced today. Waterford Wedgewood is shedding 1,400 to 1,500 jobs world wide, 100 of which will be voluntary redundancies in Ireland. The economic downturn across the world is creating enormous shocks. I spoke to a number of European colleagues over the weekend and there have been significant job losses. As I said yesterday, while there have been job losses in this country we have to manage through a difficult situation.</P>
      <P>Almost 500,000 jobs have been lost in the US in six weeks and there has also been a downturn in Ireland. Waterford Wedgewood sells the majority of its merchandise in the US and it is not unexpected that it will face some difficulties. I am more inclined to commend the company for the fact that only 100 of the job losses will be in Ireland, and they will be voluntary. We would be happy to see a similar approach everywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to clarify my comments yesterday regarding GGB. I stated that, on a GGB basis, there would be a surplus next year. This takes account of the pension and social funds. The Book of Estimates, which will be published on 15 November, will see an increase. Obviously, all Departments have to tighten up. We have to deal with the economic situation as it is. In recent years, we have increased public expenditure by what has been described by some people as excessive amounts. Across health, social welfare and education we felt it was necessary in good times to put as much money as possible into the economy to assist the less well off and to assist with issues of social inclusion and education. We will continue to do that at more moderate rates. That is what the Government is determined to do. We will plan ahead in preparing our budget <Col N="808" /> as the Minister for Finance has done on the last four occasions. This day four weeks I hope we will all be here well and healthy to see the fifth budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is a healthy budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that yesterday the Minister for Finance, who has no idea where the revenue flow has disappeared, again lectured the EU Commission stating that he had no intention of taking its advice in the economic management of the country? Does the Taoiseach think this is a prudent course of action in circumstances where it is the stated intention of the Government to ask the Commission to give it permission to put equity into Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach: Commissioner Solbes, who I had the opportunity to meet a few weeks ago, and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, are closer to being at one on the Irish situation than they ever have been. I think Commissioner Solbes would now say, because of the changed economic circumstances, that we need to continue, in a prudent way, to handle our fiscal and monetary difficulties as best we can. He would acknowledge now &ndash; although neither the Minister, Deputy McCreevy or he could have predicted it &ndash; that if we had done some of the things suggested to us last January, we would have had far more difficulties than we have at present. It is the reason the economy is still probably performing better than anywhere in Europe. However, we do not take any satisfaction out of that. We have a situation to manage. We have to try to keep economic growth as high as we can.</P>
    <P>The answer to Deputy Noonan's question, which I suppose is a fair one, on where the revenue has gone is, unfortunately, equally simple. This time last year &ndash; I remember the period well between September and Christmas &ndash; the Irish economy was growing at just under 12%. We saw the CSO figures last week which indicated that was the case. The economy grew by more than 12% in the last quarter but by 11.8% for the year as a whole. That rate has been dramatically reduced as it has all over the world. The only place which would have been equal to us at that time was Singapore where growth was 11%. It now has negative growth of several percentage points and is in a far more difficult position than we are. The world economy is either in negative or neutral.</P>
    <P>The figure for this year in this country will be of the order of 5% or 6%. I am already on record as saying I do not believe that will carry forward into the first quarter. When the Central Bank and the ESRI brought out their figures in September and I was asked publicly about them, I said I did not think they were right and that the carry over in the first quarter of this year would roll in. The 2.6% they mentioned the other day is probably more an indicator. That is the position and the reason the incomes are down across the tax <Col N="809" /> heads. We now face a situation in which we have to try to maintain employment as best we can. The Tánaiste has already said we have to look at work permits. We have to try as best we can to look after our own population and work force. There is still quite an amount of buoyancy in the labour market but, obviously, if people lose their jobs in some areas, we have to try to balance that with those recruiting in other areas, and that the Government will do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach joined me in welcoming the establishment of the new policing service in Northern Ireland and saw in its creation the necessary construction of a police force that wins the confidence of all the citizens in that part of this island. In the light of the recent autopsy report on the late Mr. Richie Barron and the growing lack of confidence in policing in County Donegal, what specific and concrete measures does this Government intend to take to fully investigate the serious allegations of wrong doing in the Garda so that it can restore public confidence in our police force in this jurisdiction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>In agreeing with what has been said by Deputy Quinn, will the Taoiseach specifically confirm that as far back as September 1997, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had a request for an exhumation order relating to this case from a senior garda in County Donegal? A senior garda in County Donegal submitted a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions which indicated that there was no case against the McBreartys as far back as 1997 and as far back as 1998, the DPP agreed to this. Why has this dragged on so long when so many senior people knew the facts so long ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated briefly yesterday, I am advised that the High Court has given leave to Mr. McBrearty to initiate a civil action seeking an order to compel the Garda Commissioner to investigate allegations of perjury. Certain allegations of perjury have been made. As the substantive issue has yet to be determined by the court, I cannot comment on the case. Deputy Quinn asked me generally about confidence in regard to this issue. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has made a number of statements in the House addressing the allegations regarding policing matters in County Donegal &ndash; there have been many &ndash; and included all of them in his remarks. The Minister has had discussions with the Attorney General. As to the holding of an inquiry, the advice to date is that it would be inappropriate to hold such an inquiry until the criminal prosecutions and civil actions relating to County Donegal have run their course. The Minister has had a number of discussions with me about this matter. He is obviously concerned about the situation. I cannot confirm what Deputy Noonan said &ndash; I just do not know the answer to that&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach check the facts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to doubt what the Deputy said. I just do not have the information. He would have to put down a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, the Minister is concerned about the ongoing matters in County Donegal. He has had a number of discussions about it and I am sure he would be glad to report to the House as matters develop. That is the legal position and the advice from the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not accept at this stage that the concern which is widespread across County Donegal and elsewhere goes way beyond the particularity of this legal case and that had his reply been given by the responsible Minister in the UK administration in relation to the RUC, it would have been deemed totally inadequate and would have been seen by some to be hiding behind the courts and due process? The concern is simply too deep and too widespread for the Taoiseach to take refuge behind a specific set of legal proceedings. There are other reports of wrong doing and other concerns which have been expressed. The Taoiseach's colleagues in County Donegal know it very well. As Deputy Noonan said, it has been ongoing for some time. It has been held back, covered up or stopped from being opened up by an incompetent Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This is too serious a matter for the Taoiseach to simply say that because he has legal advice to the effect that a court case is pending, he cannot make any comment. We need to have confidence in the Garda Síochána in the same way as the people of Northern Ireland need to have confidence in their police service. The Taoiseach is for the time being the Taoiseach of this country, the head of a Government that can take action. What concrete steps will he take to restore confidence in a fundamental arm of any democratic state, the police force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn, I said that in regard to the McBrearty initiative I could not make any particular comments other than what I have said. I did not say that meant the Minister or the Government was doing nothing on the more general position. I would preface that by saying I believe the members of the Garda Síochána throughout the country do an excellent job always, in difficult situations. I do not want to generalise the matter. Deputy Quinn is correct, there are concerns about County Donegal and the Minister has, for some time, made the point about his concerns in several statements to this House. He has raised this not only in this House but with the Government on many occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been in discussions with the Attorney General to look at the possibility of holding an inquiry but the advice to date is that it would be inappropriate to hold such an inquiry until criminal prosecutions and civil actions relating to Donegal have run their course. The Minister has also said, both in and outside the House, that he is looking at a more independent way of dealing with cases of discipline and investigation in the Garda Síochána. He has put his proposals on that into the public domain.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach indicated yesterday that a briefing had been given to the appropriate spokesperson on justice, Deputy Howlin, in relation to the forthcoming legislation that arises in relation to the international conventions and the European Council on Justice and Home Affairs. The briefing did not specify however, which international conventions will be the subject of legislation. We have ratified five out of 12 international conventions that relate to terrorism. Which conventions will be the subject of such legislation as will enable them to be ratified in this session?</P>

I may be right in thinking that the same applies in relation to the International Criminal Court. Is that included in the Taoiseach's list? There have been signs from the Taoiseach that we are to get long sitting days in the House. However, we have no indication what legislation will be put forward. When will we see it? It is important that we get an up-to-date briefing on that as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Before the end of this session, it is the intention to publish Bills to enable Ireland to ratify five international conventions. Although this could mean five Bills, it may be possible to limit this to three Bills by amalgamating items. I will ask the Minister to brief the interested parties on the five areas involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Extradition (European Union Conventions) Bill is to give effect to the EU extradition conventions. This is urgent because the European Council on Justice and <Col N="814" /> Home Affairs asked that the two EU extradition conventions enter into force in all member states on 1 January next. The Bill needs to be enacted by the end of the session to enable ratification to take place by that deadline. The Department is endeavouring to publish that Bill as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill is to allow for ratification of the 1999 UN Convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism. The UN Security Council Resolution of 28 September last, the European Council on Justice and Home Affairs, and the European Council have called for ratification as soon as possible. States must report on progress to the UN committee within 90 days. We are not obliged to ratify it in this time scale and publication of the legislation would constitute progress.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the fourth one is to allow for ratification of the 1979 UN Convention Against the Taking of Hostages. On 28 September, the UN Security Council, the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council and the European Council, called for its ratification as soon as possible. States must report on progress to the UN committee within 90 days. We are not obliged to ratify it in this time scale but publication of the legislation could constitute progress.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the last one is to allow for ratification of the 1973 UN Convention on the Prevention of Punishment Attacks on Internationally Protected Persons. The UN security resolution of 28 September, the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council and the European Council have called for its ratification as soon as possible. States must report on that progress within 90 days. We are not obliged to ratify it in this time scale but publication of legislation, for example, could constitute progress. It is the intention to publish bills to enable Ireland to ratify these five international conventions and that will require three bills. We have cleared the first of those bills and the Minister and his Department are working flat out to clear the others. We would like to have all of them, but certainly the two I mentioned, passed by the House in this session. That is what we are endeavouring to do. I will ask the Minister to brief party spokespersons in detail, but I have covered the contents of the five conventions.</P>

      <P>Will any additional legislation be necessary to enable us to ratify our membership of the International Criminal Court, or will that package of legislation, apart from enabling us to comply with the UN resolution, also enable us to ratify our membership of the International Criminal Court?</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that there are only about five weeks left before the Christmas recess, can the Taoiseach provide any indicative time frame as to when we will see the legislation, not to mention debate it?</P>

In reply to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's question, I had better not go into another long list but there are a number of other relevant issues. I will ask the Minister to brief Opposition spokespersons on those because there is a long briefing note on several other issues that covers the Deputy's point. The first legislation will be published within days. I will have to report on progress at the Laeken summit which will take place just after the House breaks for the Christmas recess. The Chief Whip has advised me that the only way in which we can make progress on these matters, so that I can report positively at Laeken on the progress we have made, is by doing it on Fridays.</P>

      <P>No paper has exchanged hands between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Opposition spokespersons. The briefing has been entirely oral. I referred earlier to the time scheduling for the proposed legislation which is very important and concerns the fundamental human rights of Irish citizens. In view of the unusual circumstances, I am asking the Taoiseach to give clear consideration to making available now the work in progress in relation to these areas. In that way, we can have the sort of legislative process here that will enable the Taoiseach to say at Laeken that he has made progress. Otherwise, with only six weeks to go, the timetable he has read out simply cannot be <Col N="816" /> achieved in a manner that will ensure that the House will have done a good job.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An lá faoi dheireadh bhíomar ag caint faoin mBille seo agus rinne mé tagairt don West Clare Railway. Dúnadh a lán bhóthar iarainn ar fud na tíre ag an am agus ina dhiaidh sin agus is mór an <Col N="820" /> trua é. Is dócha gur cheap gach éinne a bhí ag tiomáint i ngluaisteán nua ag an am nach mbeadh gá ar bith leis na bóithre iarainn ach ní mar sin atá an scéal. Faoi láthair tá brú ar na bóithre agus ba chóir go mbeadh na bóithre iarainn ar ais arís.</P>
    <P>In particular it is important that railways are used for transporting goods. Heavy trucks would then be taken off the roads and roads would be safer. Rail transport has become much more comfortable now and I compliment the rail train service from Waterford to Dublin. My one request for the line would be a change in the timetable. The 9 a.m. train which passes through Carlow is of little benefit to anyone who wants to get to work in Dublin. There is a 6.30 a.m. train but that is probably too early. I understand that it would cause difficulty if all the trains arrived into Heuston Station at the one time but these two trains do not provide a good range of times. After last night, the Minister has surely a lot of spare trains to put on the tracks. The Minister has so much money, as she said in her defence last night.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that if we got train services back more people would travel. People have comfort travelling by train, they are not stuck in traffic jams and they can read or work on the train. It is a better form of transport. However, our rail system has been allowed to run down. I asked before that the Arrow service be extended to Carlow. It would be a help and people would get off the road and travel by train if they were sure they could get to and from their destination in reasonable time.</P>
    <P>Those lucky enough to have the DART service have a marvellous system which runs on time. I do not travel much on the DART but I have been asked to request a service offered to DART passengers. If a train is delayed, or late, announcements are made to waiting DART passengers. This should be done in railway stations around the country where people are often left wondering. It would not cost a fortune to provide this service.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Sargent mentioned the train that comes from Dundalk through Malahide in the morning. People have to reverse into the train and cannot fall if they faint it is so packed. The train is full before it gets to Donabate and the Deputy did not exaggerate when he described it. A person I know well found herself suspended and unable to get her feet on the ground it was so packed. An extra carriage should be added on to the train. It is far from my constituency but I know about it because one of my family travels on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Like other Deputies addressing the issue I will be a little parochial as it gives us the latitude to refer to our own patch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the various developments that have been carried out on the Mallow-Tralee line. The whole railway infrastructure is important to a tourist county like Kerry. One-third of the tour<Col N="821" /> ists who come to Kerry arrive by bus or rail and Kerrry receives in the region of two million tourists over the summer. The rail connection is very important. The line from Killarney to Mallow has been relaid and is vastly improved.</P>
    <P>The line from Killarney to Tralee is not in good condition but is waiting for upgrading. I understand that £6 million are earmarked for 2002 and £3 million for 2003. I hope that schedule of work goes ahead and then we will have a good high standard line between Tralee and Mallow. Good railway infrastructure is important for the west. A peripheral county like Kerry is disadvantaged when it comes to industrial location and communication with the capital. An improved railway system would be of great help.</P>
    <P>I understand that the upgrading of the line does not include the lines going through railway stations. Will the Minister refer to that in her reply? Track through the stations should be upgraded and relaid also. That connects to the signalling system which will have to be laid hand in hand with the line and it is important that work is carried out as soon as possible. British MPs who came to last January's meeting of the British Irish Parliamentary Body in Killarney were shocked by the condition of the rolling stock from Dublin to Killarney, and particularly from Mallow to Killarney. The Craven carriages which are in use on that train are more than 40 years old. If the track is to be brought to a high standard it is important that rolling stock be of a standard to match it. This improves the comfort of passengers. Can the Minister confirm that the Craven carriages are to be replaced by mark 3 rolling stock in 2003?</P>
    <P>Rolling stock is very expensive. I was recently asked what I thought it would cost to replace a carriage and I suggested approximately £250,000. I was informed that a new carriage would cost as much as £1.6 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The price has risen to nearly £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>To replace three carriages would cost nearly £6 million. Money will be more scarce than in the recent past but I hope new rolling stock will be provided, now that the condition of the line is to be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rail service from Tralee to Dublin is in need of improvement. I realise that the provision of an extra service costs a great deal of money. Carriages must be purchased and there are the ongoing costs of wages and so on. The 7.05 a.m. train from Cork to Dublin is very important for business passengers. I often connect with that train at Limerick Junction and I arrive in Dublin at 9.45 a.m. I notice the large number of business people who use this service rather than the airline service from Cork to Dublin. People find it more convenient to travel by train than by air. I find I can get much more work done on a train than on a plane. The air service from Kerry to Dublin is very good and very important but it is easier to <Col N="822" /> work on a train than on a plane. Could the Minister examine the possibility of providing a train service, even from Killarney to Mallow? People from the Tralee area could drive to Killarney and then connect with the 7.05 a.m. train from Cork to Dublin. The earliest service from Tralee leaves at 7.30 a.m. and does not arrive in Dublin until 11.30 a.m. Many people find this is too late.</P>
    <P>The media have recently reported investigations into rail incidents and accidents. I understand that witnesses are reluctant to come forward because they fear that under the Freedom of Information Act for example, their evidence might lead to their being charged in court or summoned to a Dáil committee. This situation is creating a difficulty for investigations. The best way to prevent an accident is to investigate accidents thoroughly. Can the Minister confirm that this difficulty exists within CIE?</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with trespass on railways. However the Bill does not refer to abandoned railway lines. The new procurement agency should have responsibility for abandoned lines. They are important pieces of infrastructure which could be used as railway lines in the future or given other uses. CIE has ignored this important resource which could have been used for tourism. Many fine houses were allowed to become derelict through the negligence of CIE.</P>
    <P>A number of heritage railways have developed throughout the country. Does the Bill refer to safety on these railways?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>A railway safety Bill will be published in about a month's time. It refers to heritage railways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Keaveney. I welcome the fact that we are discussing this Bill to establish an independent statutory body to deal with light rail, metro and the regulation of light rail services when operating on-street.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister took the opportunity to talk about progress to date on public transport projects. She mentioned the 148 new buses acquired by Bus Éireann in 2000. Galway city has seen the benefit of the new buses. Extra services have been put in place between Galway city and Dublin, with buses running every hour. One of the reasons for this is the advent of competition from private bus companies, such as CityLink and Nestors, which provide very good services on the Galway to Dublin and Galway to Dublin Airport routes. Now that these companies have been granted extra licences we will see an even better service between the west and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Bus Éireann has not availed of all the opportunities available to it. For example, a Bus Éireann bus leaves Dublin for Tuam at 3 p.m. on Fridays. This is too early for people who wish to return to the west for the weekend. Those who use this service find there is no return service <Col N="823" /> from Tuam to Dublin on Sunday evenings. While cities such as Galway have done very well from the provision of extra buses, smaller towns such as Tuam have lost out. Now that extra licences are being given to private bus operators I hope they will provide extra services to places like Tuam and other smaller towns.</P>
    <P>Improvements have taken place on the railways. The train which leaves Galway for Dublin at 5.15 a.m. every day is a new and welcome development. I can now board a train at Ballinasloe at 6 a.m., if I make it to the station, and be in Dublin at 8.20 a.m. I and many others who have to get up at this early hour would like the train to stop at Woodlawn station, which recently underwent improvement works, because it is closer.</P>
    <P>The departure of two evening Galway bound trains from Dublin at around 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. is a welcome development. I am aware of efforts being made to ensure the 8 a.m. Galway to Dublin train arrives earlier. It used to reach Dublin at 10.30 a.m., but now arrives at 10.15 a.m. I and my fellow passengers on that train have frequently received questionnaires asking the time we would like to arrive in Dublin. The majority would prefer to arrive before 10 a.m., in particular, elderly people with hospital appointments. This time would also suit Deputies travelling from the west to be present for the Order of Business at 10.30 a.m. Now that Iarnród Éireann has made improvements to the service, I hope the journey can be reduced by 15 minutes.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks I and other Deputies have raised with the Minster for Public Enterprise the loss of the older railway lines, including the Harcourt Street, West Clare and Clifden lines. Another route which has fallen into disrepair is the Sligo Limerick line. Various committees are working to get the line maintained and improved, particularly the committee chaired by former Deputy and Senator, Martin J. O'Toole, and Fr. Micheál McGréil, which has compiled a great deal of work.</P>
    <P>I refer the House to a submission made by Mr. Frank Dawson, director of community and enterprise of the Galway county development board on 10 August, which was jointly prepared by nine county development boards and three city development boards, extending from Donegal to Cork. The submission deserves investigation and I hope the Minister and her Department will examine it. It states that £100 million would be needed under the national development plan to upgrade the Sligo to Limerick rail route and re-open its idle sections. To put that in context, we are spending £1,000 million to build a new road from Galway to Dublin. The stretch of the new road from Galway to Ballinasloe will cost £300 million, that is, three times the estimated cost of upgrading this railway line. This matter should be investigated.</P>
    <P>People ask at what point on the Sligo and Limerick route should one start work. This is irrel<Col N="824" /> evant. As with any road, one can start at both ends or anywhere in between. It is a great opportunity and the line, which was open for passenger traffic until 1975, offers the advantage of developing tourism. I noticed in the submission, for example, that there is a spur to Knock International Airport.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Browne referred to the development of forestry throughout the western region. This has been very progressive with mills at the masonite plant in Carrick-on-Shannon and in Clonmel and Waterford. Developing the line would keep heavy products such as timber off the road. From my conversations with people in the timber industry this would be a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, FÁS and voluntary schemes are maintaining some of these lines. I am disappointed Iarnród Éireann is not providing much assistance. In fact, the company at one stage took up the line north of Tuam. It was the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Séamus Brennan, who arranged to have the line reinstalled. I hope no other railway lines are taken up in future but are instead used for freight or, better still, both freight and passenger traffic. I look forward to a complete line from Sligo to Limerick.</P>
    <P>Tuam is not very well served with Bus Éireann services. A very interesting proposal has been made to establish a light rail service between Tuam and Galway as part of the Sligo to Limerick railway line. The people of Tuam have to travel to Galway to use train services and they often have to make the same journey to get a bus. There is a case for a light rail service. A line is already in place, the famous line used in the film, The Quiet Man, which was shot around Ballyglunin and I contend that we have been too quiet about this line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are too many quiet men around that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time these quiet men and women started talking about using it because there are traffic jams from Tuam into Galway city. We are told there will be a new road which will bring us out towards Athenry and into Galway by 2005-06. However, given that a railway line exists, there is a very strong case for introducing a light rail service. It has been most forcefully made by the Tuam Chamber of Commerce and the town commissioners. As anyone who travels to Galway by train will know, the great benefit of a light rail line from Tuam would be that one would arrive in Eyre Square in the city centre, unlike people travelling from the west to Dublin who still have some distance to go from Heuston Station to the city centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that Iarnród Éireann opposes the proposal because of cost and the fact that trains could only travel at 20 miles per hour on the line. It is a matter of funding and the engineering problems could be resolved. This line should no longer be used exclusively for film pur<Col N="825" /> poses, although that would be welcome, provided there are passenger services from Tuam to Galway. Light rail would also help alleviate some of the traffic problems in the area. The Minister has done good work on public transport, both on the bus service and rail. Much of the Bill deals with Luas and light rail. My argument is that there is a strong case for a light rail system between Tuam and Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to The Quiet Man. I do not intend to be the quiet lady with regard to the position of Donegal. However, I will begin by welcoming the Bill. Any improvement to the light rail infrastructure around Dublin will undoubtedly assist everybody. Every time I see a reference to &ldquo;railway infrastructure&rdquo;, however, I cringe and scream and shout in a corner before I can respond reasonably. I would love to have to deal with the problems mentioned by Deputies Michael Kitt and Deenihan regarding questionnaires on passengers preferred time of arrival in Dublin or length of train journey. I would even like to have problems with train strikes. Those of us living in that remote northern place, which is in reality far from remote, bypass those problems.</P>
      <P>A train service or link for Donegal would be a crowning achievement. I hope this Minster who, of all Ministers, managed to improve our infrastructure in a very significant way, can provide us with a service. She was at the forefront when we argued for a Dublin to Derry air service and was on board its inaugural flight.</P>
      <P>To link this to the topic at hand, we can fly from Donegal to Dublin in 30 minutes, or 40 minutes on a bad day. It often takes twice that to get from the airport to Leinster House. I welcome, therefore, the development of infrastructure around Dublin. The Minister looked at infrastructure from a different perspective as well and put her shoulder to the wheel to improve the gas network, including the link between Belfast and Letterkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That will be of huge significance to us in the north-west. I have heard many Deputies from north Dublin complaining about job losses and my heart goes out to the Aer Lingus workers and the many other workers who have lost their jobs in the recent past. Two years ago my constituency lost more than 2,500 jobs and we have not had a great deal of success in achieving a turn around. Infrastructure is a key element in that turnaround of our fortune. The Dublin to Derry air service is bringing people into the region and I know many people use it for business and holiday visits. Proper infrastructure is vital for business, for tourism and for ease of movement. It takes me five and a half hours in my car to travel to Dublin. Five and a half hours out of a busy schedule such as we all here have is unfair. I have to do a day's work after spending a traumatic time just making the journey. The national spatial strategy has anticipated that traffic volumes will double between now and 2006. The projection for traffic has more <Col N="826" /> than exceeded our expectations and it presently equals the projection for 2011.</P>
    <P>Our roads cannot cope with current traffic volumes and we know these volumes will increase. The railways will be the solution to these problems, particularly in the carriage of freight. The Minister for Public Enterprise has led the charge in upgrading the Derry to Belfast road. I used the Belfast to Derry train service when I was a student in Jordanstown. At that time there was no link between the two Belfast stations which would allow the train continue on to Dublin. That situation has been addressed and there have been improvements on the Belfast to Derry line. It would not involve very significant investment to introduce a Derry to Dublin rail service. The line is there and the rolling stock is available. Anything would be better than a five and a half hour journey by car and a four hour train journey would be more than acceptable to the people of the north-west region.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister use her connections with the new Deputy First Minister in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Mark Durkan, who is also the Minister for Finance. Mark Durkan is from Derry and he understands the situation and would probably value the service as much as any of us in Donegal. Mr. Durkan could be asked for an estimate of the cost of improving the tracks and rolling stock in order to develop a through service from Dublin to Derry.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed yesterday when the Ceann Comhairle's office refused a parliamentary question of mine to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government about the N2 &ndash; A5 road. I wanted to ask the Minister what discussions he planned to have with his counterpart in the Northern Ireland Executive in relation to the A5 road, the road from Aughnacloy to Derry. The question was ruled out of order because the Dáil has no responsibility for that road. I am sure that if I table a question on the Belfast to Derry rail line, I will get the same response. The Dáil has a responsibility particularly following the Good Friday Agreement. It is very relevant to me to have a Dublin to Derry train service and a Dublin to Derry road network. It should be discussed at ministerial level and the Members of this House should be entitled to an answer in these matters. I am confident the Minister for Public Enterprise would be prepared to raise the issue on my behalf.</P>
    <P>My constituency is not far from Derry, it is a major regional centre. We would like to then see an extension of the service to Letterkenny and into Inishowen as it was in the past. This would not be a new service and that is what annoys many people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>They were closed in the 50s or the 60s when many other lines were closed. I have maps and details of what used to exist. Not <Col N="827" /> all routes could be regenerated because of building development but some of the routes would be available. I agree with Deputy Michael Kitt on the issue of the Sligo to Donegal connection. He spoke about the Sligo to Limerick connection but I would be in favour of a through connection from Limerick to link up with the Derry service in order to incorporate the whole western region and the whole north-western region and so have an all-Ireland train service available to us. The roads cannot cope with the traffic levels. We are not building huge autobahns but we have an existing railway structure which could be updated. It would not be an impossible task.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Mark Durkan on becoming Deputy First Minister of the Northern Ireland Executive. Gregory Campbell is also from Derry and he will understand the special needs of the north-west region. I hope to have the same opportunity to do my work while travelling by train as the other Deputies have and end this obvious discrimination against me. I want Letterkenny and Inishowen to have a train service in the not too distant future but it will not happen unless a serious effort is made and the costings are examined. I know this Minister delivers. She has a knack when it comes to cross-Border operations and she has my full confidence. Now that the Good Friday Agreement is back on track, if the pun can be excused, I hope that there will be no more bomb scares on the Dublin to Belfast line. Anyone who tries to disrupt the infrastructure should be severely dealt with. It is important to have real infrastructure that can be used and enjoyed and many local groups have developed small sections of old railways. I wish the Minister well with this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Deputy Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to give five minutes of my time to my colleague from Limerick, Deputy Finucane. There is no other element of transport where there have been more lost opportunities, than the rail transport system. I am not in a position to remember 70 or 80 years ago but people at that time had the choice of a number of modes of transport. There was a poor road transport system but quite a good rail transport system which was modern and effective for the time. The canal system was used for heavier goods. In a moment of inspiration and for some unknown reason, it was decided that with an improving road network there would be no need for the rail service and the County Donegal rail service as mentioned by Deputy Keaveney and various other lines throughout the country were closed down. Several rail networks in my constituency have been closed. There used to be a rail link to Naas. The rail bridge is no longer there and the new motorway crosses the area between the Sallins rail line and the town of Naas, although the rail line could be reconnected. There <Col N="828" /> has been a dramatic increase in traffic on the roads. I welcome the introduction of this Bill and hope it will be effective for the sake of the Minister, the people and the country.</P>
      <P>All the old rail systems have been closed. I will not go into what happened to the Harcourt Street line with which I am reasonably familiar. When those rail lines closed the volume of traffic began to increase and the need for transport is increasing all the time. The need for heavy goods transport was never more obvious that it is now, but the options are limited. Heavy goods can be transported by rail, underground in our towns and cities or on alternative road routes. Many people would say we should not provide any alternative road routes, that the answer to all transport problems is to stop building roads and that the volume of traffic will reduce, but that is not the case.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that cities in the UK and elsewhere throughout Europe built motorways and autobahns 50 to 60 years ago to cater for the volume of traffic. They invested in the rail infrastructure at that time and built undergrounds. They provided for infrastructure then, which we did not. It is understandable that we did not do so. We were a young nation. We had no record of policies from which to work. We borrowed from the policies, many of which were defunct, of the former Administration across the water. We ended up with a dearth of infrastructure in road and rail transport and the canal system was closed to all intents and purposes. Some changes have been made. The canal system has been restored to a certain extent for recreational purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some lovely ones in the Deputy's constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is great. I remember being at a meeting 20 years ago at which it was suggested that the canal that runs through the town of Maynooth should be filled in and a road built on it. That shows how dangerous it can be to make a decision on the spur of the moment. We must think in terms of planning for the future.</P>
      <P>Two options remain open to us, the road and the rail systems. This Bill can only be successful if it is part of an integrated transport policy. On its own it will not solve anything, but if what is proposed in it was part of an integrated transport policy, if there were distinct objectives for a link up at various strategic locations throughout the country and if there was interlinking of the various towns and villages which could be done comparatively cheaply, it could be successful. If that is not done, we will end up in a few years' time hopping from one tragedy or emergency to another and we will be faced with problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main streets of towns and villages are not the place for heavy goods traffic. A certain amount of such traffic is necessary for deliveries. As long as heavy, articulated vehicles can travel through the centre of small towns and villages, accidents will happen &ndash;  and some occurred in <Col N="829" /> my constituency in recent weeks. That is the nature of the movement of such traffic in small towns and villages because it is impossible to be vigilant to the extent that is necessary in order to preserve life. We must consider reliance of bypasses in the road system. That must be part of the integrated policy which will back up the system provided for and envisaged in this legislation. If we do not consider that, we will be back to square one.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to drive through this city because of the combination of traffic competing for the roadway. The left lane is a bus lane, although sometimes it is the middle lane. I recognise the necessity for the bus lane and often there is a cycle lane to the left of the bus lane on one side of the road or sometimes of both sides. The trucks usually travel on the right of whichever lane is not already occupied and sometimes in two lanes where two exist. That leaves no possibility for traffic to move other than at the speed of the heavy goods vehicle.</P>
    <P>The European Affairs Committee produced a short report a few years ago that examined the serious problems facing commuters in the greater Dublin area. That report is four years old but its recommendations are still relevant. In the context of its proposals, I ask the Minister to encourage the various agencies involved to co-operate in addressing the traffic problem. The Road Haulage Association was most co-operative and supportive of proposals put forward at that time. The docks board also needs to be involved in the equation. As long as heavy vehicular traffic pours out from and into the docks during peak hours, there will be serious traffic congestion and it will get worse. There is no way around that problem because our booming economy, or the economy at any time, will generate that volume of traffic. To address that problem, the co-operation of the various agencies involved is required.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to encourage the city traders, the docks authorities, those responsible for traffic management in the corporation and road hauliers to co-operate to try to address that problem. From my experience, I am sure the road hauliers will be most helpful. They claimed they could reduce their charges to their customers by anything up to 15% and do more work in a given day if there was a regulation in place on the hours the docks were open in order to eliminate the heavy goods traffic in the centre of the city at particular times. The basis for that report was the European directive on transport and the sharing of transport opportunities and facilities, the provisions of which will come to pass in the not too distant future. If we do not do what is proposed in that report voluntarily, we will have to do so by virtue of that directive. I ask the Minister to ensure that is done now as it would be complementary to what she is trying to achieve and it would free up traffic somewhat in the city and for up to 20 miles outside it. During the construction of Luas there will be much more serious traffic problems than we have experienced so far.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> The western commuter route, which has been upgraded, is heavily trafficked. Problems have been experienced on that route in recent weeks due to its upgrading and coming onstream of the new rolling stock. It took some trains up to an hour and a half to reach their destination because of leaves on the tracks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy tabled a parliamentary question on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, but that situation should not arise. On the same route on another morning a level crossing gate was not opened on time because the person who opens the gate could not get to work on time. We have to depend on a person travelling from A to B to open a gate at C to let commuters go about their business. I am aware that arrangement is being examined with a view to changing it, but it is a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
      <P>The use of undergrounds in the future must be examined much more carefully and closely. If our roads are crowded with trucks, cars, buses and bikes competing for the meagre road space available, it follows that we must go for the underground option. Every other capital city &ndash; we will be doing so to a limited extent &ndash; has done that. They do not seem to have experienced the problems that we anticipate. We should not hold up progress on the basis that the make up of the subterranean terrain is such that it is impossible to build a tunnel through it. People have been building tunnels for the past 200 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I made that argument when we changed the Luas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know. I am not disagreeing with the Minister. The point is that the Romans were able to build tunnels so I do not understand why we cannot get around to doing it.</P>
      <P>There is a necessity to provide spurs where possible, particularly where there are growing communities throughout the country. When one asked about this in the past, one was told it could not be done because the necessary resources were not available. We are now reaching the stage where it is necessary to provide spurs, regardless of resources. If we do not do so, everything will come to a stop.</P>
      <P>On some days I can travel the 20 miles or so from my home to this House in half an hour, on other days it might take two hours. That is a huge difference. There must be some mechanism along the route causing the problem, whether it is traffic lights failure or trains breaking down and pouring more people on to the road. That problem exists and I ask the Minister to bear it in mind when implementing this legislation. It is welcome legislation but it can only be successful if it is part of a co-ordinated and integrated plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue is the growth of satellite towns outside the greater Dublin area. It is essential to <Col N="831" /> provide an alternative means of transport. However, there is a suggestion that we should build towns and cities along railway lines. It is a good idea from the point of view of transport but it does not look good. There must be an overall plan. There must also be a local community identity. It should not simply be the case that multi-storey blocks are built near railway tracks to facilitate easy transport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. We might claim that this country has problems but other countries are far more densely populated. Ireland is one of the least densely populated countries in Europe. We seem to have the most horrendous traffic problems but we are not able to deal with them. There is a multiplicity of reasons for that. There are countless objections to any proposals. There is a reliance on archaic planning law which we appear to be unable to change to meet the requirements of modern life. With such a combination we will continue to have problems.</P>
      <P>This country has a population of approximately four million. Holland has a population of almost 16 million although the area of the country is only one quarter that of Ireland. It is incredible that we should have these problems. It should be remembered that Holland is densely populated in its rural areas too. Six per cent more of the population in Holland lives in rural areas than is the case in Belgium. Holland appears to manage with a huge population and a huge economy that has been tried and trusted over the years.</P>
      <P>I compliment the proposals in the Bill. I hope they will be part of an integrated plan and that there is adequate follow-up of the Bill rather than the usual stop-start situation &ndash; no pun intended.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Durkan for sharing his time with me. Yesterday, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Enterprise was before the Committee of Public Accounts, so we had an opportunity to discuss the plans for the future.</P>
      <P>Under the national development plan it is projected that £2 billion will be spent on transport infrastructure. Of that sum, £650 million is to be devoted to regional infrastructure. Is the Minister confident there will be sufficient funding to give priority to the safety infrastructure and to provide the rolling stock and engines to make our railways compatible with modern demands? The Minister might have read an article in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Independent</i> under the headline, &ldquo;CIE has derailed our train system&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was probably an isolated example but the article focused on a congested train, on which people were drunk and whose <Col N="832" /> clapped out engine broke down and had to be replaced. Passengers spent hours on the train. As an image of the rail service, it was an isolated example. I travel regularly by train and I am impressed by the professionalism of the staff. I am also impressed with how various railway stations have been upgraded and improved to make them more consumer friendly.</P>
      <P>Recently I travelled on the enterprise train from Dublin to Belfast to meet members of the public accounts committee in Northern Ireland. I was most impressed by the train, which was new, and the consumer relations aspect of operations. That is the direction we must go nationally. Members have mentioned the improvement of the Cork service and the new special carriages but if the rail service is to be compatible with consumer requirements, the improvements must be carried out on a national basis. The Minister will agree with that point.</P>
      <P>One issue that has concerned me recently is the freight element of the service, which was long a significant feature of Iarnród Éireann's policy. It focused on the Kingscourt line and the transport of gypsum. The goods aspect of the service is being researched at present. Funnelling more traffic on to the national roads is a contradiction of our transport philosophy. I can give the example of Foynes port in west Limerick. There were two mines in the Silvermines on one occasion, Magcobar and Mogul, which successfully transported their ores by rail to Foynes.</P>
      <P>I discussed this issue with the former Minister for the Marine and Natural Resource, Deputy Woods. When the Galmoy mines were being established in Tipperary all the ore was transported by road to Cork, through the traffic into the city and on to the port and the warehouse. At the time, although the economics probably dictated that it did not happen then, a spur line of eight miles would have taken the ore to Thurles and it could then have been transported by rail. That would have removed a huge number of trucks from the roads. When studying proposals for the future role of Iarnród Éireann with regard to goods traffic, one must look at such situations. Transporting freight by rail should be encouraged in the interests of road safety and relieving congestion of our roads and cities. If freight is being transported to ports, it should be brought by rail.</P>
      <P>I would like to develop these points further but time dictates otherwise. These issues should be examined with regard to goods traffic.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. It provides for an independent and commercial statutory State body to be called the Railway Procurement Agency. It will be in charge of approval of railway infrastructure projects, including light rail and metro, and the regulation of light rail services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> Everybody is aware of the importance of addressing congestion in urban and non-urban areas and the need to provide a reliable and efficient public transport system. Much progress has been made in that regard. One of the important things is that we now realise we cannot afford not to do these things. The national development plan provides for investment of £2.2 billion, the kind of sum that trips fairly readily off the tongue these days but was frightening and unimaginable as recently as seven or eight years ago.</P>
    <P>In her Second Stage speech, under various categories, the Minister listed the additional transport infrastructure which has been provided or has been ordered, including DART carriages and buses. I estimate that there are approximately 430 additional buses on various routes and that 150 replacement buses have been acquired. Almost 80 rail carriages are in use or have been ordered, at least 220 miles of track has been replaced, 240 level crossings have been brought up to a modern standard and about 200 bridges are in use and 50 others are under construction. In a short time, a huge amount of work has commenced to improve public transport infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister stated that she intends to bring forward a Bill to create a regulatory framework for railway safety. Everyone realises that safety is of crucial importance and the new Bill will be a considerable addition to transport legislation. Those who frequently use rail services, especially inter-city services, have come to appreciate the advantages of line welding. It makes the journey a great deal more comfortable, as it means there is much less noise and greater speed is possible. It is frustrating for the Minister and all involved with the railways that it is not possible to order carriages from the shelf and that there is a considerable waiting time. The delay in procuring engines and carriages seems to militate against the better use of the existing rail network. The carriages have been ordered, however, and will come on stream in 2002 and 2003. The implementation body will have responsibility for Luas. I welcome the fact that the Tallaght and Sandyford lines will be in operation in about two years' time.</P>

      <P>I used to live in Dublin city centre, but for personal reasons I have been living about ten miles from the city centre for the past few months. One has to experience the delays in the morning to understand the frustration of those stuck in traffic every day. One cannot help noticing that 90% of cars travelling towards the city centre have only one occupant. I suspect that many people make journeys that could be as easily accomplished on public transport, but it is a <Col N="834" /> matter of personal choice. I suspect strongly that people are more readily inclined to abandon the car for a rail carriage than for a bus and I think this is borne out by the DART experience.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct. People in rural areas tend not to understand the difficulties of accessing work places that are faced by people in cities. Opposition politicians often castigate Governments for spending huge amounts of money in Dublin and argue that it demonstrates that Dublin rules everything and enjoys an unfair share of infrastructural improvements. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. People in relatively rural areas, such as Galway, Limerick and Cork, appreciate the problems encountered by people in Dublin as they face many of the same problems. Traffic can be a problem in a town like Ennis. The approach roads to Ennis were very quiet a few years ago, but now suffer from a huge level of congestion. It is not possible to say that a journey will take ten minutes, as one must allow for the fact that there may be a 20 minute delay, causing the journey to take half an hour. The Acting Chairman and a number of other Deputies here represent rural areas, where there are travel difficulties, albeit to a lesser extent. Newmarket-on-Fergus, in my constituency, has become nationally famous as it is invariably in the top three towns in terms of delays.</P>

      <P>The bypass there has almost been completed, however, following several years of planning and three or four years of construction. The first phase will open shortly, which will be a great help. As Deputy Donal Carey said here a few weeks ago, the problem will be transferred elsewhere in the short-term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The second phase of the bypass is under way and will be completed within the next few years. I made a submission on the national spatial strategy based on the need to create <Col N="835" /> national counter balances to the Dublin cosmopolitan mass. I see the Shannon area, including Limerick and Galway, as a possible such balance. Cork is another region with the capacity to perform such a role. We need to work pro-actively to invest in infrastructure in those places.</P>
      <P>When the Newmarket-on-Fergus bypass was under way, a 24 inch water pipeline was needed between Shannon and Ennis. There was an enormous difficulty in persuading NRA engineers that it was possible to lay the pipeline in conjunction with the acquisition of land and the construction of the road. The truth is that the NRA resisted strongly, but was persuaded eventually to allow the water main to be laid. The planning involved in many roads projects could also take in additional rail networks. I have often plagued the Minister about the need for a spur line to Shannon Airport. The NRA could have been much more co-operative, for example by allowing for the joint planning of the rail line, even if it was not to be built for 20 years. There is no difficulty along most of the potential line, but problems may be posed by a complex road junction. The spur line will happen and it will have to get past the junction I have mentioned. It could have been accommodated readily when the junction was being planned, but it was not.</P>
      <P>I refer to the closed West Clare Railway, which is frequently mentioned in song and was discussed by Deputy John Browne <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i> during the debate on 18 October. An article about the west Clare line was mentioned by Deputy Finucane last week. A section of the line between Kilrush and Kilkee is being restored at modest cost. I pay tribute to Iarnród Éireann's co-operation in leasing an engine and making old rail available. It is a project with enormous potential benefits in terms of tourism as there is a huge international railway enthusiasts network, which this country has not yet tried to attract.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen:</NameTxt>
      <P>The West Clare Railway Company acquired the land for the line and sufficient rolling stock. It had a turnover of £35,000 last year and a local man, Jackie Whelan, has done most of the work. Unfortunately, the company falls between all the stools in terms of financing from Departments, which is a great pity, as the project has considerable tourism potential. The line would link Kilrush and Kilkee by rail, which would be a major attraction for the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan and others have referred to air connections. The air links between Dublin and Cork, Waterford, Farranfore, Shannon, Galway, Knock, Sligo, Carrickfinn and Derry should be actively subvented, especially in the short-term as there are problems with the rail network. It is possible to encourage more people to use the air network, although I concede that when one arrives in Dublin Airport, in Deputy Seán Ryan's constituency, it often takes longer to get to the <Col N="836" /> city centre than it took to get to the rural airport and to fly to Dublin. Such transport problems will be addressed by the proposals in this Bill. A good case can be made for the subvention of air services as they provide much quicker connections and reduce travel time dramatically. There has been a move to using aeroplanes for domestic travel and in the present climate, anything that can be done to promote the use of airports and air travel should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I will finish with two brief points. I pay tribute to the mini-CTC signalling project sub-committee, which faces an arduous and time-consuming task. The Deputies involved are engaging in important Oireachtas work, which very few of us would be prepared to do at a time when half our attention is directed towards the forthcoming general election. The Minister has heard me mention the need to upgrade the Sligo-Limerick rail line on many occasions, especially the possibility of a spur line to Shannon airport, which could be established for a modest cost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which, as the Minister outlined in her speech, provides for the establishment of a procurement agency with a &ldquo;can do&rdquo; focus. The agency will ensure that the Luas line, currently under construction, will have an operator and that the envisaged metro lines will be developed. Having listened to Deputy Killeen's experiences as a commuter from the suburbs of Dublin, I am pleased that County Clare is still represented by a man who can look into his heart to see what the Irish people want and need. He showed tremendous insight into the problems of the Dublin commuter. It is important and it will command agreement on all sides of the House that this legislation is enacted as quickly as possible to allow the agency to do the important work in relation to Luas and the development of a metro. The core functions of the agency are set out in section 11 of the Bill. It clearly envisages not only the provision of light and metro railway infrastructure, but it also gives the agency the power to enter into agreements.  What is envisaged are public private partnerships in the development of our railway infrastructure.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the scope of the Bill is not limited to the Dublin area because this agency can improve the railway infrastructure in any part of Ireland. That is important because the type of problem we have experienced in Dublin in recent years is mirrored to a greater or lesser degree in the other urban centres of population. There are other issues, such as those raised by Deputy Finucane, about the long-term use of the rail network to take heavy goods off the road network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to focus on the greater Dublin area. It is a substantial part of the State and that is where the problems of traffic congestion and commuting are at their most acute. I have the honour to represent an area which is set to grow to a suburban centre of more than 100,000 people. The latest estimate is that the greater Blanchardstown area will have a population of <Col N="837" /> 120,000 people within a decade. That is a dramatic increase from the recorded population of 57,000 at the last census in 1996. The reason the original projected population of 100,000 has increased to 120,000 is that the Department of the Environment and Local Government now requires increased residential densities in planning applications.</P>
    <P>That touches on a point raised by Deputy Durkan that we need higher density population to plan for a better transport infrastructure. If we keep building Dublin in the dispersed way we have done for a long time, we will not be able to provide an efficient and up to date transport infrastructure. That is an example of where a Government took a hard decision on densities, although it did not suit us at local level. However, the decision was taken and implemented in the national interest. As a member of Fingal County Council, Deputy Seán Ryan did not press that view strongly. However, as we face into a general election we, on this side of the House, must point out to the people that we were not afraid to take certain decisions. That was not a popular decision in the area I represent.</P>

      <P>We cannot live in a make believe world. That is one of the problems with the quality of local debate on this subject at county council level. Given that our population is increasing to that level, we must have a planned infrastructure. While this is an excellent agency which is badly needed because we need a practical agency to deal with the practicalities of acquiring land and building the rail infrastructure, we need a vision of where the overall structure will mesh and we also need a planned and phased implementation schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must make it clear as far as Dublin is concerned &ndash; I know the Minister has said this many times &ndash; that the first priority must be a proper rapid rail link to the airport. I am sure Deputy Seán Ryan would agree with me. It is absolutely essential that we develop rapid transit between the airport and the city centre. That must be our priority project. We cannot let that drift because there has been too much delay in implementing important infrastructural projects. I know the light rail office is looking at that and at the associ<Col N="838" /> ated western orbital route which affects my constituency. I was unhappy with the indicative guidelines outlined by the Dublin Transportation Office about that route. They seem to belong to a land of poetry rather than a land of practical implementation. The light rail office is looking at that and trying to see how those routes can be brought into the practical realm. I welcome that. I reiterate, the first priority in terms of the metro must be to develop a rapid link to the airport.</P>
    <P>We must also look at how the new system will serve the new housing estates which are being planned and developed in an area such as Blanchardstown. The routes proposed by the Dublin Transportation Office went through settled residential areas which are already served by an existing public transport network. This seems to be one of the major planning problems with both Luas and the DTO initiative. Routes have been planned for areas which already have a rail or bus infrastructure, but we seem to forget because of the pace of development that we need to plan for areas which are as yet unbuilt. That is where the priority lies in terms of infrastructure and the plans should reflect that. I am talking about planned rail infrastructure and the metro.</P>
    <P>Since I was elected to this House I have said we should not ignore the fact that we can build on the tremendous existing rail infrastructure we already have in the greater Dublin area. I welcomed the Minister's decision when she took office to make a substantial investment in the Maynooth line. That programme of investment must be ongoing. There is a technical problem in that there are a limited number of slots available at Connolly Station to integrate the line into the main DART line which runs from Bray to Howth. However, there are other engineering possibilities. We should examine the option of reopening the line to Broadstone because the land is still there. There is also a line which runs underneath the DART line down to Spencer Dock. That could be examined so that more carriages are placed on that line. There are similar lines running through Kildare and north Dublin which must be developed and investments made. I was delighted the Minister referred to the fact that an investment has been made in a large number of rail cars. This must be a continuous programme.</P>
    <P>While the procurement agency has a function in relation to new infrastructure and it is important we get on with that work and we lay down clear priorities, we must start by developing a clear route to the airport. We must also develop other lines for new areas while focusing on bringing new infrastructure into those areas. In Blanchardstown, for example, we should tie in the town centre and the new residential developments to the west of the town centre, link it with the Maynooth line at a westerly point and carry it on to the new development planned in Lucan at Adamstown which will have more than <Col N="839" /> 10,000 housing units. These are the types of developments the light rail office must examine.</P>

      <P>There is no point looking at where the houses are already; we must look at where the houses will be. The failure in our infrastructure planning to date is that we planned for housing after the houses were built. We must plan and anticipate what will happen in these areas because there is no point pretending that Dublin will not continue to grow. It will continue to grow and we must cope with that fact.</P>
      <P>As regards existing infrastructure, I am a little concerned that while the Bill gives a strong focus on developing new rail infrastructure, investment in the existing rail infrastructure is the best investment we could make because in value for money terms it is a good return on the investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that at last public transport is getting the priority, attention and the legislative framework it deserves and needs. The Labour Party spokesperson on Transport and my Kildare colleague, Deputy Stagg, has taken a constructive approach to this Bill in the context of the importance the Labour Party attaches to developing our public transport infrastructure. We had some reservations about the Bill which were expressed by Deputy Stagg, such as the fact that we want safeguards in the Bill to ensure it is not a back door to privatisation. The experience of Railtrack in the UK must surely raise warning signals about the risk to our public transport system of privatisation.</P>
      <P>I am also glad to have the opportunity to congratulate the Minister on the re-opening of the railway station at Monasterevan. Unfortunately, I was not present on the day she re-opened it but I know the chairman of the station committee, Nelly O'Rourke, gave the Minister a great welcome and everything went well. I am delighted this station will have a pivotal role to play in serving the people of the area and it is hoped this initiative represents the first step in strengthening public transport services for the people of County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour's commitment to the development of public transport is long-standing but its importance goes beyond all loyalties. It is crucial that public transport is developed to service counties such as Kildare, given its proximity to the capital city. For example, over the few years there will be massive traffic disruption in the metropolitan area because of the construction of Luas and it makes sense to take commuter traffic off the roads and divert as much of it as possible to the <Col N="840" /> rail system to minimise the disruption that the growth in car numbers will inevitably generate.</P>
    <P>I recently attended a SIMI seminar at which it was stated the continued growth in car ownership will inevitably lead to congestion on our roads and there is an absolute need to define alternative transport services, especially in regard to access to our capital city. In that context two important interchanges are to be built along the N7 at Johnstown and Kill, County Kildare, and this will result in further disruption of the traffic flow to and from Dublin and for people living in Kildare. If more commuters can be attracted to use public transport fewer problems will result from these construction developments. Alternatives must be provided to road transport where road infrastructure projects are planned to preserve some semblance of a reasonable transport system over the coming years for commuters and those living in the counties adjacent to the metropolitan area.</P>
    <P>Athy is almost a satellite town of Dublin. My son has a house in an estate in the town and of the 37 houses in it, the occupants of 29 commute to Dublin on a daily basis. That has created problems for the infrastructure of Athy and County Kildare generally. It is not enough to tell people that in the long run it will be to their benefit if they wait in long traffic queues in the short-term as many developments are undertaken to provide a better road and rail infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The importance of proper parking facilities at train stations cannot be over emphasised. There was a major overhaul of such facilities at Kildare station and it has been of major benefit to commuters availing of the Arrow service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope Monasterevan station will be developed in a similar manner. It is important facilities are provided to attract commuters to rail stations so that they know their vehicles will be safe for the day and they can avail of the train services to Dublin. They also do not face the risk of being clamped and so on if they had to bring their cars into the city. It is also in this sense that I welcome the re-opening of Monasterevan station.</P>
      <P>I have long been an advocate of the extension of the Arrow service to Athy and Carlow. I have been advised there are plans to introduce such an extension in the next few years and there is a need to extend the line between Hazelhatch and Kildare before that can happen. Given the increasing traffic problems in our area, these plans should be advanced and implemented as soon as possible. There is a growing number of people commuting from my constituency to work in Dublin as a consequence of rising house prices in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> We want to provide commuters with a viable alternative to road transport and the Arrow service can contribute in this regard. The Minister is committed to extending the service and it would be of major benefit to all the towns on the line. Carlow town could be used as a terminus with trains picking up commuters at all stations in County Kildare. Perhaps a service could be provided between Kildare and Carlow stations in the short-term to alleviate some of the problems that will be created by Luas and the N7 developments.</P>
    <P>As each year passes, people throughout the country, and in Leinster in particular, are horrified by the growth of traffic and the prospect of increased growth. It is for this reason that we welcome public transport initiatives such as that provided in the legislation. It would be a nonsense if this measure was nothing more than part of a hidden agenda to privatise our rail system. The problems of transport in our area require a much more imaginative and patriotic approach and I am taking it as read that the Minister is adopting such an approach.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and hope the Minister takes on board my comments regarding the advancement of the Arrow service. Kildare has become part of the greater Dublin area and the number of housing developments in small villages in Kildare South is unbelievable. They have all but lost the name of a village because of increasing populations. As I travel through these villages, I often see two or three cars outside every house and these contribute to the problems on our roads. The N7 is an absolute nightmare and one would want eyes in the back of one's head to negotiate it because of the volume of traffic.</P>
    <P>The development of Monasterevan station and the Arrow service will help, I hope, but the Minister's Department must emphasise the need to utilise the rail system to overcome the gradual reliance on cars to travel to Dublin. Deputies Durkan and Killeen referred to the number of cars with a lone driver travelling to our towns and cities. Every effort should be made to highlight the need to avail of rail transport rather than road transport through advertisements and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate and to discuss the lack of public transport generally like many colleagues in both Houses. It is now fashionable for all parties to say they are in favour of public transport. I first entered the House in 1989 having been a former employee of CIE and I was very much aware of the running down of public transport and particularly the rail service over the years. I recall highlighting at every opportunity the need to provide more finance to upgrade public transport and improve the infrastructure and I was heckled by different sides of the House. Some Members at the time did not understand the difference between subvention and the need <Col N="842" /> for capital investment for rail and other public transport systems.</P>
      <P>The Bill relates to the operation of Luas and in many ways it is restrictive because I thought the Minister had other intentions in regard to both Luas and the Metro. I do not take it from her, but some months ago the Minister went to London for a photo-call on one of the Luas carriages. However, last weekend the Taoiseach had to become involved by way of a photo-call which led to a ludicrous situation in which traffic was disrupted and the project incurred considerable cost to put a Luas vehicle on display in the city centre.</P>

      <P>I accept that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the crisis regarding public transport in the greater Dublin area, particularly in the rail network. Chronic over-crowding on trains is causing stress and frustration for commuters. Even though I do not travel by train as much as I would wish, I regularly visit train stations. Last week I had to push young second<Col N="843" /> ary school children on to a train so the carriage doors could close. This is an on-going situation and parents are concerned for the safety of children. Irish Rail has some excellent officials on the ground and the company stresses that safety is not put at risk. However, trains, particularly those operating at peak periods, on the outer suburban route from Pearse and Connolly Stations to Drogheda are known as the &ldquo;sardine express&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A scandalous situation has developed which reflects the lack of commitment of successive Governments to public transport. More money has been allocated to this issue. However, an impression is being given that problems, particularly those regarding the northern suburban route which takes in Howth, Portmarnock, Donabate, Malahide, Skerries and Balbriggan in my constituency, will be solved by the DTO's programme for change and short-term action plan called DASH.</P>
    <P>This programme will solve the problems if money is made available. However, there is a major restriction on the number of trains which can access Connolly and Pearse Stations at peak periods. A document published by the DTO regarding this issue contains pie in the sky proposals. It suggests that the situation can be dealt with by the construction of an interconnector tunnel from Heuston Station, via Pearse Station, to the docklands, with links to Maynooth and the northern DART lines which would take in the outer suburban area. The document also refers to the construction of a third track from Connolly Station to north of Howth Junction. These proposals look good for people trying to get on trains and off congested roads. The Minister can state that this is what will be delivered. However, what is happening when one gets down to the nitty-gritty? Is anything happening to deal with the major problems? There is a plan called DASH, but no work is being done regarding the implementation of its short-term proposals. Money has not been made available to even commence work next year.</P>
    <P>One has to balance issues and there is a need for housing. Under the higher density proposals the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is directing local authorities to construct more three, four and five storey housing units along railway lines. People are being directed to live in such areas by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, local authorities, builders and developers. However, by the end of 2003, when all trains will have up to eight carriages, the additional capacity will only be for 2,000 passengers at the most.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this fact, there are proposals for an extra 253,000 dwellings in the greater Dublin area, 18,500 of which will be in my constituency. People are going to live in these areas on <Col N="844" /> the basis that trains will be available. The Minister should stand up and be counted on this issue.</P>

      <P>No, I am not.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, 2001. Part II of the Bill provides for the establishment of the railway procurement agency. Part III provides for a single statutory process for railway infrastructure projects and Part IV provides for a regulatory framework for running light rail on our streets. It is generally accepted that this Bill is necessary and I commend the Minister on bringing it before the House. We all recognise the need for an overall plan and strategy to oversee the development of rail transport. It deals specifically with the Luas and the metro projects and many people might ask what relevance that has to a rural Deputy like me. The reality is, it is hugely relevant. This is a small country and many people from rural areas come to Dublin on a weekly basis to do business, for medical treatment or whatever. We are as concerned about a proper public transport system in the city as anybody else. We have our own concerns which I will mention in a minute. I am delighted the Minister is taking very positive action on the situation in the west, and improvements are continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact the railway procurement <Col N="845" /> agency will be an independent statutory State body with responsibility for procuring light rail and metro projects as determined by the Minister and that the light rail project office, suitably restructured and expanded, will form the starting point for this new agency. As the Bill already indicates, the focus of this relates to railway infrastructure. What everyone wants to see is a high quality infrastructure providing a reliable and efficient public transport system. The growth in our economy and the way the country has developed &ndash; probably faster than anyone could have expected in the past five years, in particular &ndash; is a massive challenge facing a Government.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Ryan talk about this Government and photo-calls. The reality is that this Government is the first to put its money where its mouth is by putting £2.2 billion into the public transport system bringing about massive improvements over the past four and half years. With an investment of that nature, it might take many years for the benefits to be seen and realised. The reality is the work had to start and, unfortunately, we were starting from a very low base because of the neglect of many Governments previous to this one. I commend the Minister on the very progressive steps she has taken in relation to the public transport system.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the increasing level of car ownership in urban centres which has resulted in massive congestion. This, however, is not only happening in the urban centres. When we talk about public transport, we often tend to focus on the main cities. As everybody in this House knows, because it has been debated often enough, we have a massive congestion problem on roads such as the N5. Travelling to Dublin yesterday from the west, I got caught behind three articulated lorries in a row on the Roscommon stretch of the N5. Anyone who has travelled on that road on a regular basis will know that once that happens, one will not go anywhere for a long time. Some 20 years ago, one could travel from the west to the city in three and half to four hours. I am sad that today it takes a person at least as long, if not longer, to travel to the city. That is why the development of the rail links throughout the regions, which have been neglected for so many years, is hugely important to help remove the congestion problems, even on roads like the N5, and to encourage people like myself doing business in the city to use the rail system.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to get on the train in Castlebar and travel to Dublin but there is no point having a great link to the city unless a public transport system is available in the city to enable people staying there for two or three days to carry out their business efficiently. As I said, the Minister had to start from a very low base and sometimes people want an immediate solution to what has turned out to be a very serious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>We all do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we all do. People want <Col N="846" /> the railways laid and the Luas to be operational immediately but we all know a project of that size will take many years. We have to put up with a great deal of disruption in the city to put such a system in place and people have to be very patient.</P>
      <P>I welcome that under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, we are investing £2.2 billion in public transport. By anyone's reckoning, that is an unprecedented level of funding in the public transport system. It will enable major advances in that area in the years ahead, and I compliment the Minister on that.</P>
      <P>In addition, a railway safety programme has been under way. This is something in which I am particularly interested because if affects my part of the country. Some £430 million has been invested in railway safety between 1999 and 2003. To date 220 miles of track have been upgraded as have 189 level crossings, although 50 further crossings remain to be done. Some 190 bridges have been upgraded with a further 45 to be completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>We have seen significant improvements on the Dublin-Wesport line which goes through Athlone, a line with which the Minister and I are familiar. It has taken until now for the benefits to come on stream and we have suffered serious disruption. However, as I mentioned earlier, from the point at which the investment is made to see an improvement in a service takes time. Between Athlone and Westport, 63 miles of track have to be upgraded to continuous welded track. Some 11 of those miles were done in 1999, 13 in 2000 and 21 in 2001. Some 45 of 63 miles have been completed &ndash; two thirds so far &ndash; with an investment of more than £20 million. A further £10 million has yet to be spent and is expected to be spent over the next year.</P>
      <P>We welcome the continuous welded track &ndash; it is a huge upgrade and the first time that type of investment has been made in the Dublin-Westport line. However, we need good quality carriages. While I welcome what has been achieved under the NDP &ndash; the new DART carriages and 60 Arrow rail cars &ndash; the carriages to the west need to be looked at. In line with the excellent work she is doing, I would appreciate it if the Minister would take that on board. I travelled on that line as a student. When Deputy Ryan spoke about pushing people on to a train to enable the doors to close, it brought back some memories from my student days when there was standing room only on a rather cold and inefficient train service from the west. While we have seen improvements, a great deal of work remains to be done. I understand the Minister recognises that and that some improvements have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, in the west, would like to see lines reopened, in particular the reactivation of the Claremorris &ndash; Collooney line. As the Minister will know, a committee has been set up to examine that. While some people might think that pales in significance to some of the problems we have in the city, it would provide a major tourism <Col N="847" /> facility in the west. The line is already there and I understand the Department is already aware of the cost involved. Obviously, it would cost a significant amount of money but I ask that the Minister consider it because a fairly active committee has been working on it for a several years. It would be great to see its efforts rewarded and a major tourism project for the west at the same time.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister might examine developing the line from Claremorris to Galway. We have a huge amount of commuter traffic again causing terrible congestion on the roads between Claremorris and Galway. Travel times have increased drastically, although the standard of that road is quite good. However, if that line could be re-opened, most of the necessary infrastructure is in place. I would appreciate if the Minister could look into that matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome that the Minister has taken the Dublin light rail project by the scruff of the neck. Her</P>
    <P>commitment to this project since coming into office has been 100%. We are already seeing the benefits. The construction of both lines is on target and will I hope be completed in 2003 with passenger services commencing shortly thereafter. That is welcome. In addition, the construction of the metro and the light rail network will require the focus and attention of an implementing body. That is covered in the Bill by the establishment of the Railway Procurement Agency.</P>
    <P>Much has been achieved to date. Huge investment has been made in public transport and this Bill goes a long way towards achieving the goal of better transport services. There has been a regional input into the area of railway safety and the development of public transport throughout the country. This should remain uppermost in the Minister's mind although we must also deal with the problems in the urban centres, and particularly in Dublin. While I welcome that £2.2 billion has been committed to this, in the years ahead more funding must be ploughed into public transport, and particularly into the railways, if we are to provide a serious alternative to the congestion currently being experienced on our roads and urban centres.</P>
    <P>Rail transport has been debated in the Dáil many times in recent years, particularly from a west of Ireland perspective. I am sometimes amazed by the comments from the Opposition benches. While the Opposition was in Government, &ldquo;railways&rdquo; was a dirty word and not mentioned. There was no investment in the rail network. I find it extraordinary, therefore, that we are today to debate the Minister's position during Private Members' business. The Minister has gone to great lengths, in all areas of her brief, to improve services to the public. Of all Ministers, she has one of the heaviest work loads and has dealt with some of the most serious topics during her term in office. The Minister is only one woman and it is great from a gender point of view <Col N="848" /> to see someone who is prepared to take the issue by the scruff of the neck and deal with it. The Minister has achieved a huge amount in her period in office and I assure her of my support during the Private Members' debate in the House.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House and welcome that it is generally recognised by both the public and trade unions that this is necessary legislation if we are to develop an overall strategy. Developments such as this must be planned, and must be implemented properly when a plan is in place. This Bill will help to achieve that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do. The PR system is very important. I wish to share time with Deputy Connaughton.</P>
      <P>It might be said that, as a rural Deputy, I and others are anti-Dublin and against the system in Dublin. We are not. Dublin, whether we like it or not, is our capital city. I like Dublin city. It is important, as Deputy Cooper-Flynn has said, that when people come to the city we have a proper transport system in place for them. We support Luas and hope it works and that we see further improvements on the line from Dublin to Westport also.</P>
      <P>I intend to have a closer look at the new carriages in Merrion Square. I saw the carriages there yesterday and they look impressive. People can be negative or positive about this matter but we have been negative about railway infrastructure for the past 50 years. We did not deal with the problems as we should have. Nobody thought our roads would have to take the number of cars now travelling on them, or that Ireland would progress as it has. We might be going through difficult times at the moment, but the cars and people will not go off the road. There will be infrastructure problems and they must be dealt with. We may want quick solutions, but it is certain that we need solutions, whether or not they come quickly.</P>
      <P>I was elected to the Dáil in 1994 and can remember leaving the west to travel to Dublin at a time when there would be little traffic congestion until one got close to Dublin, or perhaps at some other places on busy days. That is no longer the case. There are problems in every town and village on the road to Dublin due to the number of cars on the road. It is important that the public rail service is upgraded and brought to a proper standard so that the public will use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a strong association with Irish rail. My uncle worked with Irish Rail for 40 years and he <Col N="849" /> loved the company. I remember being critical of the company at times and my uncle did not like that. Some people treat their work as just being a job, others have a love for it. He had a love for the railways and for Irish Rail. He still visits the railway station daily and he owns the Railway Tavern at Westport. There is a strong bond between those who love the railways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>These people were upset to see what has happened over the years in relation to funding not being put in place. It is like the situation in politics where the Minister might have responsibility for funding but she cannot be blamed if a train does not travel further than Athlone today, because she is not driving the train. At the same time, the Minister is responsible for funding and ensuring that the service is available. Over the years, the funding has not been put in by successive Governments. Those workers in the front line who had to deal with customers were the ones who took the flak. They were upset by this over the years.</P>
      <P>On the service to the west, I acknowledge that the funding has now been put in place. However, I am worried. Last week, some 600 people were working on the line between Athlone and Westport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I believe some of these people are to be made redundant. Deputy Cooper-Flynn was correct. We have suffered. People do not mind suffering if that brings about a better service and we hope to see that in the near future. A part of the track from Castlebar to Westport still requires work. I hope the Minister will instruct the body dealing with the track to undertake that work immediately. There is again talk of postponing the work. It was to be done in 12 months but that changed to 18 months. Three years is now the suggested time scale. That defeats what the Minister has done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right. She has enhanced the station, and I compliment her on that. The first impression rail travellers coming from Dublin or abroad have of a town is when they alight from the train. The station-master at Westport has certainly improved the station and has won many awards as a result. She is quite entitled to those awards because she has done an excellent job.</P>
      <P>If there is any possibility of opening the line from Claremorris to Galway the Minister should do so. Galway is a university town and is also home to the regional hospital. Every week, thousands of people travel to Galway from Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo. If that railway line could be opened it would take thousands of cars off the road.</P>
      <P>A dispute is currently going on between Iarnród Éireann and Coillte concerning the transport of timber from the west to Waterford. The Minister should investigate this matter with her colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, who has responsibility for Coillte. There is a row because Iarnród Éireann says it is not receiving enough money for the service, while Coillte says it is paying enough. The Minister should intervene to avoid a situation whereby big lorries will come to the west where there is already enough traffic on the roads. The rail structure is already in place so the Minister should intervene to bring both these semi-State companies together. Coillte should not be allowed to take timber from Mayo and Roscommon by road when a rail service is available. Such a development would have two knock-on effects: one would involve job losses and the other would put further pressure on a road infrastructure which is already carrying enough traffic. The Minister's Department is trying to take traffic off the road and encourage people to use trains. The Minister should intervene to bang heads together and make Coillte use the existing rail structure. It would not be right to allow an alternative system to develop using road transport to carry timber. I hope it does not happen.</P>
      <P>Over the years, rail users in the west have had to use old, unheated train carriages. People pay good money to travel by rail yet they have not received a proper service. Now that we have proper rail tracks, the Minister should make funding available to upgrade carriages, thus encouraging people to avail of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> I do not use the train service simply because one cannot be assured of arriving in Dublin on time, and until such a punctual service is in place people will not use it. People use the Galway to Dublin service because they know it will arrive on time. In the meantime, they can have their lunch or tea on the train. Many people, however, do not use the rail service because they cannot depend on its punctuality. This is particularly the case for people with hospital appointments. Over the years people travelling by train have been late for such appointments and have missed out on medical treatment as a result. I hope that situation is now coming to an end. I would rather be positive than critical on the basis that something is happening to improve the rail service. The Minister must ensure, however, that improvements continue to occur. Improvements to the railways must not be drawn out, thus causing further frustration for passengers.</P>
    <P>People involved in chambers of commerce in the west use the rail service regularly. They are rail enthusiasts and want the service to succeed, as I do. It does not matter whether Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil are in Government, because the taxpayers' money is being used. I hope the Luas system works and that it will take cars off the roads. That will be good for us all.</P>

      <P>Such is the psychology behind being cocooned in one's own new car that it will take a huge counter attraction to get them out of their vehicles, irrespective of what the alternative transport is. No matter what is being done in Dublin, we are losing that battle. The Minister is not the first to have lost this battle and I assume she will not be the last. Statistics show that the number of new cars coming on the roads are overwhelming us. No matter what route one takes out of Dublin, there are certain flash points where one will get caught in traffic jams. I have <Col N="852" /> been commuting to Dublin for years and, on the occasions I brought the car, I did not see a problem in Moate until recently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it. A huge problem has arisen because we did not take the railway seriously 25 years ago. That is a long time in planning terms but the railway was not taken seriously by anybody; it was regarded as the poor man's transport system. One went by train when one did not have any other way of going. The private bus owners who came on the scene 20 to 25 years ago with cut price fares, started to bring Iarnród Éireann into line so that tickets no longer cost an arm and a leg. While I have many good things to say about Iarnród Éireann, one of the company's biggest problems concerns public relations. The standard on the Galway-Dublin train is good but I am always travelling mid-week when the carriages are clean and not overcrowded, although sometimes they may be too old.</P>
      <P>The PR image breaks down at weekends, however, when a younger generation is commuting home to the provinces. They experience a train service that is jammed, with no space to stand or walk. These young commuters form an opinion that will stay with them forever because they only use the trains when they are packed and uncomfortable. If, however, they used the trains midweek, as I do, they would admit it is a fine way of travelling. I do not know how Iarnród Éireann's management manages to run such packed trains, or if it is possible to overcome the problem when one cannot foresee how many people will be on the platform. Every weekend without exception, however, 52 weeks a year, Iarnród Éireann is caught out on capacity. I do not know what the Minister can do about that but if Iarnród Éireann's management has an eye to the future it should treat young commuters well. In that way, young people &ndash; the executives of tomorrow &ndash; will continue to use the train service instead of retaining a bad image of it. The Government is as much at fault as anyone else although it put more money into railways than anyone else. The point is, it had more money available. It just does not compare with the remarkable amounts of money being spent on roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own city of Galway will have huge roadways coming into it within the next six years. We will be able to get from Ballinasloe or Tuam to within one or two miles of the city quicker than ever before and unless the planners take drastic action now on park-and-ride systems etc. we will <Col N="853" /> create a problem we did not ever think we would have. We will have superimposed a serious Dublin problem on the city and the same will happen in all towns and cities with new access roads unless we plan systematically in tandem with the building of new roads.</P>
    <P>This is where the railway system has a role. The matter may be parochial but it is hugely important in the context of the development of Galway city. We are in the happy position that there is already a rail track on a radius of about 12 miles around the city. Starting in Tuam it goes right up to Athenry and from there into Oranmore and then into the city. It is mostly unused but the track is there. There is no problem with landowners or no need for court cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no compensation rates or anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there would be none of that. I have been a lone voice advocating for years that there is a case to be made for hefty investment in an area that will have a huge draw of investment into an ever expanding city. We should take an imaginative leap forward and make a type of Luas or DART out of this available railway line. Just imagine what it would achieve. There would be no problem in Tuam for space for park-and-ride. There would be no problem in Ballyglunin where &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo; was filmed as there is an existing railway station and hundreds of acres that could be acquired and the new town of Oranmore would have no space problem. We could open a whole new infrastructure and have trains travelling on a half hourly basis.</P>
      <P>Consultants have told me that the only reason it is not possible to go to feasibility stage is that the die has been cast with funding. Roads got the bulk of funding and in relation to extra expenditure the railway system remains the poor relation. I do not blame the Minister for this but when history is written it will show that the railways are still the poor relation. We are making a monumental mistake when we do not put thought and investment into railways because people are willing to travel by rail rather than subject themselves to the torture motorists have to face on the roads. Luas or no Luas, our traffic problems will not improve unless we invest in railways.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>: </b>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House. It proves her commitment to the railway infrastructure. Deputies on the other side of the House have commented that she is losing the battle but I feel she is just commencing in giving the railway struc<Col N="854" /> ture the priority it deserves. For far too long it has been neglected.</P>
      <P>I wish to talk particularly about the Dublin to Rosslare line. I have written many letters to the Minister who has passed them on to Mr. Joe Meagher, the managing director. His replies have not been to my satisfaction or to the satisfaction of the people of Wexford. There is an urgent need to upgrade the Dublin to Rosslare line. I have a particular affinity with CIE as my first job was in the freight station in Enniscorthy. That freight station which was once a hive of activity is now closed down. The question must be asked as to where CIE management has gone wrong. The freight section of CIE was vibrant, delivering cigarettes, clothes, drink etc. Just about everything was transported by CIE at the time. Unfortunately, that has changed and there is now talk of closing the last few freight sections around the country.</P>
      <P>It is obvious with the expansion of Dublin that the likes of Gorey and Enniscorthy will become commuter towns. For example, 2,000 new houses have been built in Gorey in the past five years. While we have fast trains from Arklow into Dublin we find it difficult to get any priority in extending the service to Gorey, Enniscorthy and Wexford despite repeated requests to Mr. Meagher and other directors of Iarnród Éireann. This area should be looked at seriously because of the number of people involved. About 40% of the houses built in Gorey were purchased by people from Dublin. People are moving from the city because of congestion and transport problems. The rail line is there and there is an obvious opportunity to expand it. With little investment we could extend the services to these towns and encourage people to take the train rather than the car.</P>
      <P>It is practically impossible to drive to Dublin from Wexford in any sort of a reasonable time. I was once able to travel to Dublin from Enniscorthy in one and a half hours. That was before the Bray and Arklow bypasses. It now takes three hours &ndash; an hour and a half to Loughlinstown and then another hour and a half to the Dáil. Some of the traffic management decisions in relation to travelling into Dublin need to be questioned. As a matter of urgency we need to try and put more people off the road and on to trains but we can only do that if we have fast trains into Dublin from rural towns. The train from Enniscorthy to Dublin takes from three to three and a half hours because of safety factors required on the line. I accept that the line is being upgraded and I am delighted that a significant number of young people from Enniscorthy and Gorey are employed on the work although there are rumours that they may be let go due to cutbacks. I urge the Minister to ensure that the line is upgraded and that no untold delays occur because of cutbacks or because of decisions taken by management in Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will have been in the Dáil for 20 years next year, and during those years I have argued with <Col N="855" /> different Governments and Ministers about the line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The social welfare benchmarking and indexation group was established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It began its work in December 2000 and completed its deliberations in early August 2001. The group's final report was presented to Government in September and its contents noted at that time. While arrangements for the formal publication of the report are in hands, I have, in the interim, arranged for copies of the report to be placed in the Oireachtas Library. The report is also available on my Department's website.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the group required it to examine the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments, having regard to their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns, and to examine the issue of relative income poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group's report represents a valuable contribution to the development of policy on social welfare rates. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the implications of setting a benchmark for welfare payments and of adopting specific approaches to indexation. It sets out a number <Col N="856" /> of recommendations on these issues, although the Deputies will be aware that it did not prove possible for the group to achieve a consensus position on the desirability of establishing a formal benchmark.</P>
    <P>The report's findings and recommendations will be carefully considered in the context of the forthcoming budget and in the development of future welfare policy generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>For several years the Minister has asked the House to wait for the conclusions of the report. His reply did not indicate whether he is in favour of the majority recommendation of the benchmarking and indexation group. Does he agree with the majority recommendation, supported by three members of his Department, that the lowest rate of social welfare should constitute 27% of gross average industrial earnings by 2007?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than outline my personal view, I refer the Deputy to a more relevant view, namely, the first sentence of the majority recommendation in the report in which the group recognises that the exact rate was &ldquo;a matter for Government&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>&mdash;not the benchmarking group nor me, personally. Even those in the majority in the group recognised that decisions should be taken by the Government of the day on the basis of the prevailing economic circumstances. The report makes a valuable contribution. Many Deputies, including Deputy Brian Hayes, are critical of the fact that many outside groups rather than politicians are making decisions. Ultimately that responsibility lies with politicians. I assure the Deputy that the Government will take this report, as well as a number of other factors, into consideration when framing the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>From the presentation we received yesterday at the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs it appears the report of the social welfare benchmarking and indexation group was effectively blown out of the water by the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, both of which are vehemently opposed to its findings. The question asked yesterday was why these Departments got involved in the benchmarking group if they fundamentally oppose benchmarking for social welfare payments. Is the Minister being resolutely bullied by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, the two Progressive Democrat and quasi-Progressive Democrat members of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>

Does he agree that the most recent research to hand, One Long Struggle, by the Vincentian partnership for social justice, in other words, St. Vincent de Paul, which dramatically shows that the increases in social welfare rates granted by the Minister over the past four and a half years are totally inadequate for meeting the needs of a family?

      <P>An objective comparison of the record of the Governments the Deputy supported with the record of this Government will show his arguments do not stand up. In 1997, for instance, the Government Deputy Broughan supported did not give a real increase, that is, ahead of inflation, to people on social welfare. It did not introduce a real increase in 1998. The increase provided by this Government in 1999 was double the rate of inflation and in 2001 the increase in the rate of social welfare payment was above the rise in average industrial earnings and twice the inflation rate. The Deputy said not enough research has been done. I have incontrovertible research from none other than the CSO which shows that in <Col N="858" /> 2001 the average industrial earning increase was 8.5%.</P>
      <P>Short-term UA was two points ahead of that, 10.5%; old age contributory pension was 10.4%; long-term unemployment was 10.3%; unemployment benefit and disability was 10.3% as opposed to 8.5% for the average industrial earning and most of those figures were more than twice the consumer price index, 4.5% for last year. This should be compared with what happened when the Opposition were in office, and particularly in 1996 when the figures were way behind the gross average industrial earnings and ahead of the consumer price index at that time. The Opposition does not have a great record itself and should not be abusing this Government.</P>

Six months ago the Minister asked me to wait and see what the benchmarking review would come up with. They made their report. The only thing this Minister knows is that he does not know where he stands on the issue. He is like Hamlet, he cannot make a decision whether he is for or against it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The dispute in the Department's office in Letterkenny arose initially out of the filling of three additional temporary posts in the office by the recruitment of staff on short-term contracts. The staff are required for a limited period for work associated with the introduction of a new system for the delivery of child benefit from that office. In addition to child benefit, the office also administers treatment benefit which comprises dental and optical benefits and medical appliances.</P>
      <P>The industrial action which involves 157 clerical staff commenced on 2 October 2001 with a ban on dealing with telephone and fax inquiries and a withdrawal of availability for overtime working. The action was extended on 30 October 2001 to include a ban on a range of other tasks and withdrawal of co-operation with the new service delivery project. While the industrial action is preventing people from making telephone and fax inquiries in relation to entitlements, I would emphasise that claims continue to be processed and payments continue to be made to all recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the inconvenience to the public arising as a result of the industrial action. Every effort is being made to resolve the dispute within the context of existing industrial relations agreements. These agreements already provide for the recruitment of temporary staff in certain circumstances and also provide an agreed mechanism for resolving disputes that may arise in relation to temporary recruitment. This mechanism involves the dis<Col N="861" /> cussion of the matter at a special monitoring group and can involve a facilitator at the request of either side.</P>
    <P>My Department is happy to have the issue resolved in this way and has so informed the union. However, contact between the Department and the union is ongoing with a view to resolving the dispute.</P>

We are talking about relatively small sums of money being given to those on social welfare or under the social welfare code. There is a backlog in the Department. Will the Minister confirm that since this industrial dispute started, there has not been one meeting between the unions and senior management in his office, despite the fact that the unions have on many occasions sought a meeting? What is the Minister going to do about it? Has he considered involving the Labour Relations Commission in this dispute?

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a recent report published by the UCD Department of Environmental Studies which suggested that up to 2,000 elderly people were dying prematurely each winter due to the fact that they cannot afford to heat their homes; if, in view of these figures, he will provide for an immediate increase in the fuel allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[27068/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers is a technical study that seeks to define and quantify the extent of fuel poverty in Ireland. The author concludes that about 11% of households experience fuel poverty using one measurement approach that takes account of factors such as the condition of the dwelling and fuel efficiency as well as the affordability of fuel. The report states that the eradication of fuel poverty requires investment in capital stock and the introduction of energy efficiency programmes.</P>
      <P>The author's policy recommendation is that the State should introduce a programme targeted at certain groups with the aim of eradicating fuel poverty through domestic energy efficiency improvements. As the Deputy will appreciate, responsibility for such a programme does not come within my remit. However, fuel poverty is one of the aspects of poverty being considered as part of the review of the national anti-poverty strategy which is currently under way. I hope it may be possible to make progress along the lines suggested in the context of the NAPS review when it is finalised.</P>
      <P>The report does not call for improvements in fuel allowances. The author refers in the report to future work he proposes to undertake. He states that the future work will show that fuel poverty is in no small part responsible for the high levels of excess winter deaths found in Ireland each year in which 2,000 mainly old and vulnerable people die prematurely from cold related causes. At no point does the report show justification for suggesting that 2,000 people die each year in Ireland because they cannot afford to adequately heat their houses during the winter months. The claim of inability to afford adequate heat in the home was the category which attracted the lowest percentage of blame for fuel poverty in the course of the study. I will examine closely any policy recommendations that might be suggested when this report becomes available, particularly in relation to the social welfare system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>In the meantime, I recognise the importance of ensuring that people on low incomes can afford fuel and I accept that this is an important aspect of countering fuel poverty. The extent to which people on social welfare can afford fuel is kept under review in my Department. The objective is to ensure that the combined value of weekly social welfare payments and fuel allowances rises <Col N="864" /> in real terms, after compensating people for information, including fuel price inflation.</P>
    <P>This is being done. The increases in primary payments of £8, 10.16 to £10, 12.70 per week that I brought into effect in April of this year are the largest ever implemented.</P>
    <P>Giving people a real increase in their primary payment for 52 weeks of the year is a more expensive option than increasing the fuel allowance payment rate for part of the year. However, it is the correct approach to take as it gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs. That, coupled with programmes to improve the fuel efficiency of the housing stock, will bring about the reduction in poverty levels, including fuel poverty levels, that I am working to achieve.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree this report is a damning indictment of his administration of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for the past four and a half years? Members on the Opposition benches have pleaded with the Minister during the debates on the past five budgets to increase the fuel allowances. The most common request I have received from people around the country from Kilkenny to Donegal who write to me as Labour spokesperson on this area is that they want increased the fuel allowances, which are a miserable £5 and £8. They have not been increased since 1984. The premise that the Minister has no responsibility for all of this is totally inadequate.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept the fundamental bottom line conclusion of this report is that 2,000 elderly and vulnerable people should not die unnecessarily each year because of an inability to heat their homes properly due to their being on a low income? That is the fundamental point. Some 133,000 households are affected and one in ten pensioners who live alone are the most vulnerable group. More than a quarter of a million of homes, which do not have central heating or electric storage heating, are extremely vulnerable. The issue of fuel poverty should be a fundamental aspect of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy review. The groups on whom the Minister should have concentrated in relation to fuel poverty are those in receipt of social welfare income, pensioners, particularly those living alone, and local authority tenants, 20% of whom do not have central heating. Were those not groups on whom the Minister should have concentrated during the past four and a half years? When we go out to meet the people&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2002, for the first time, increases in social welfare payments provided for in the budget will come into effect from the beginning of January. This will be a major advance on the position which applied heretofore.</P>
      <P>When the Government came into office in 1997, budget increases in weekly social welfare payments were payable for only 29 weeks from early June. Child Benefit increases were payable for three months from September. Over the past four years I have ensured that social welfare recipients receive their budget increases earlier. For example, this year's increases in weekly payments were payable for 39 weeks from the first week in April in line with changes in the tax code. Child benefit increases became effective three months earlier from June 2001.</P>
      <P>From next year the tax year and calendar year will be the same, commencing on 1 January. Social welfare increases and tax changes will apply from the beginning of January.</P>
      <P>Recipients of short-term payments such as unemployment and disability benefits will receive their increases from the first pay day in January &ndash; 13 weeks earlier than in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> Due to the lead in time involved in the production of certain payments, it will not be possible for budget increases to be paid immediately in all cases from January 2002. Book based payment systems, which are the chosen payment option for the majority of pensioners and other long-term beneficiaries are less flexible than other payment methods and require longer lead in times to implement.</P>
    <P>My Department has examined all possible options to ensure that the payment of the new rates is made as quickly as possible and as close as can be to the date on which they are due. In this regard a lump sum payment will be included in the first order in new books for 210,000 customers which will be issued in early February 2002. A further 393,000 people who are due to get new books in April 2002 will receive a special payment in mid-Feburary 2002 containing arrears for six weeks and an advance payment for seven weeks to bring them up to the date on which their new books arrive. Nobody will lose out as a result and everyone will get their arrears by mid-February 2002, six weeks earlier than the budget increases in 2001.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The essential point is that increases will be effective from the beginning of January in all cases, that is, earlier than ever before. Where the increases cannot be paid until mid-February there will be full retrospection to the effective date of the increase. My Department is undertaking a programme of information provision to ensure that all social welfare recipients are made aware of the arrangements which will apply in their case. My officials will outline the details of these arrangements to the Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that this is further evidence of his incompetence and inability to deliver these small increases to people on social welfare? Is he admitting that half a million people will be unable to get their small increases in social welfare from 1 January because the Government did not introduce the budget earlier? If the budget had been introduced in late November these small payments could have been delivered to the poorest of the poor on 1 January.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the 1996 legislation in respect of prompt payment. Why is it that there is one set of rules for suppliers to State companies but those rules can be disregarded in the context of poor people on low incomes? Why will the Minister not pay interest to those who will not get their payments until February? In effect, the payments will not be paid for six weeks. This is another example of the Minister's inability to deliver anything significant for those on low incomes.</P>

      <P>Work is well in hand in my Department to effect a smooth changeover to the euro on 1 January 2002. All the Department's customers will be paid in euro from their first pay day in 2002. Payments up to 31 December 2001 will continue in punts and customers who are paid by cheque, by direct credit or using their social services card at the post office will be paid in euro on their first pay day in 2002. Customers who are paid by payment order book already have books which include orders in euro for periods after 1 January 2002. Information on the euro has been included in the books.</P>
      <P>My Department is also undertaking a major information campaign to inform people about the euro. This campaign involves television, radio, newspaper and bus and rail advertising, press releases and information leaflets, direct customer mailshots, public events including open days, posters widely distributed and information provided on the Department's website. In addition, the Department will establish a freephone euro helpline to handle customer queries from mid-December this year and into the dual circulation period next year. The Department is also co-operating with the Euro Changeover Board in the implementation of its public relations and information campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of its information campaign, the <Col N="871" /> Department is paying particular attention to the needs of pensioners and people with literacy and numeracy difficulties. In this connection, the Department has met with a number of organisations representing special needs groups and further meetings with these organisations are planned in the near future.</P>
    <P>The question of payment of increases in social welfare benefits from 1 January 2002 is separate from the euro. The Government has decided to bring forward from April to January the date for payment of budget increases in social welfare rates. This is being done in the context of the change in the tax year to align it with the calendar year from 1 January 2002&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of practical difficulties in relation to the payment of the increases in all cases on time on 1 January, as I outlined earlier. Deputies will recall that, in the current year, the effective payment date for the budget increases was brought forward to April. This meant that for the first time social welfare increases came into effect at the same time as the changes in the income tax provisions announced in the annual budget. The position in 2002 will be even more significantly improved with the increases effective from January, which is a full three months earlier than this year.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not accept that many seniors and others on social welfare income are hopelessly confused by the run in period to the euro? People have made bitter com<Col N="872" /> plaints about massive rip offs in increased prices for food such as meat, cheese, salads, fruit and vegetables which are now being imposed by traders. The Minister and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, have not responded to this attempt to get the retaliation in first on the part of people in the business sector, which is impacting seriously on people on low income. Is the euro not the last refuge of the scoundrel in this regard? Is the Minister not hoping that people on low social welfare income will not notice the miserable increase he will give them in early December because it will be in euros? He will be talking about a basic euro rate of 112, 115 or whatever&mdash;</P>

Quite apart from the efforts <Col N="876" /> of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland under the stewardship of the Minister for Finance, I have insisted that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs deliver a campaign targeted at social welfare recipients.

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>Over 106,000 pensioners receive an Irish non-contributory old age or survivor's pension, of which 10%, some 10,300 people, also receive a British retirement pension. The contributory British pensions are paid directly to the people concerned by the British Department of Social Security and not through my Department. The British pensions are less than the maximum rate of old age non-contributory pension payable in this country. The people concerned are therefore entitled to an Irish pension to, in effect, top up their British pension to the level of the Irish non-contributory pension. As with any other pensioners resident here, they have full entitlement to various free schemes, such as living alone and fuel allowances, depending on their age and household circumstances.</P>
      <P>A pensioner's means from all sources are taken into account when determining the rate of old age pension. If the pensioner has a British retirement pension, the current value of that pension in sterling is first determined. The sterling value is then converted to Irish punts <i>via</i> euro, using the exchange rate that prevailed at the time of the most recent increase in the British pension or the rate of exchange in subsequent quarters, whichever is most beneficial to the pensioner. Once awarded, the rate of old age or survivor's pension payable to people with British pensions has to be adjusted for changes in the rate of the British pension or changes in its value as a result of exchange rate movements. Deputies are aware that it is a legal obligation on pensioners to notify the Department in the event of changes in their means.</P>
      <P>Pensions are reviewed by my Department as part of an ongoing review and control programme. The current review arose in the context of implementing improvements introduced in the 2000 budget in the assessment of capital for non-contributory old age and survivor's pensions. That involved the exemption of the first £10,000 of capital for pension purposes, compared to £2,000 as it used to be, and was of significant benefit to 23,000 pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reviewing means for the purpose of implementing this measure in individual cases, it was necessary to undertake a complete means review. Some 7,000 of the old age pensioners concerned had, in addition to the capital, means from other sources, particularly a British retirement pension, and the value of such pensions had to be taken into account. The Department subsequently undertook a complete review of all cases with income from similar sources. In this context, 5,600 pensioners with British pensions have had their Irish pension entitlement reassessed to date. Of these, 3,501 pensioners, 62%, have had their old age pensions reduced due to increases in their means; 112 pensioners, 2%, had <Col N="879" /> their pensions withdrawn as their means exceeded the statutory limits for entitlement; 1,720 pensioners, 31%, experienced no change and a further 283 pensioners, 5%, received an increase in their Irish pensions. In the context of the reviews, British pension is assessed using the sterling to euro rate of exchange either at the date of the last increase in British pension or the rate of exchange in subsequent quarters, whichever is most beneficial to the pensioner.</P>
    <P>It is open to any pensioner to request a review at any time in the event of a reduction of means due to currency fluctuations or for any other reason. The Department carries out 2,000 pension claim reviews routinely per year, about three-quarters of which are undertaken at the pensioners' request. Of these reviews 40% result in an increase in pension rate with a further 35% resulting in no change. The balance of 25% of these reviews result in rate reductions or cessation of entitlement in cases where pensioners have significant increases in other means. Where a review results in a change in pension rate, the pensioners concerned have the normal right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office. As Deputies are aware, under social welfare legislation individual decisions relating to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I do not have a role in making such decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>A question is coming if you give me a chance. Some 2,000 people were randomly checked across all schemes; 5,000 people on this scheme were checked this year. The Minister targeted them. Some 3,600 people have lost money. These people left the country in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and they earned their money through hard work. Why can the Minister not leave them alone? What did he do for them when sterling was weak? How much money did the Department give them? Why did the Minister not wait until the new people came into the scheme instead of taking money off old people and upsetting them? I have never before met so many old people who are upset by a Government decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>How much did the Minister give these people when sterling was weak? Why does the Department calculate the rate of sterling at <Col N="880" /> the beginning of the year? It should be done on a weekly basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that there are 106,000 pensioners, of which a proportion are in receipt of foreign pensions, the Department could not calculate it on a weekly basis. They do it on a quarterly basis and in accordance with EEC regulation, Article 107, EC574/72, on social security for migrant workers. It is exactly the same mechanism for conversion. In all cases consideration is given to benefit those people in terms of the exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree these are not migrant workers but are mostly Irish citizens who were forced to go abroad in the 1940s and 1950s because there was no work here? The Department normally reviews approximately 2,000 pensioners. Does he agree that a direction has been given when 5,600 people in a particular group are reviewed in one year? These people have British pensions with a top-up Irish pension. Two-thirds of those people suffered decreases in their pensions. Does the Minister conclude that this group was specifically targeted by the Department and that it is mean to do so? </P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 21, 22, 25, 46, 52, 66 and 157 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carer's on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. In addition to the substantial weekly rate increases of £8 for carers aged under 66 and £10 for carers aged over 66, I also announced a number of other <Col N="885" /> measures to support carers in my budget speech for 2001.</P>
    <P>I made provision, in particular, for a substantial increase from April 2001 in the weekly income disregard in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. The effect of this increase ensures a couple with two children earning a joint income in the region of £15,100 will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £26,000 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance plus the free schemes and the respite care grant.</P>
    <P>The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of assessment of household income and the measures I have introduced further enhance the qualification criteria for this scheme. As I announced in my budget speech last year, I envisage moving towards what I see as the optimum situation whereby all carers whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings will qualify for the carer's allowance at the maximum rate. Given the many supports required by carers, particularly in the community care and respite care areas, I do not consider that the abolition of the means test at a cost in the region of £132 million is the best way to support carers or the best use of resources.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance, published in October 1998, considered the purpose and development of the carer's allowance scheme both in terms of its current operation and future development. It examined a wide range of issues, including the payment of carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. In this regard the review estimated that approximately 65% of carers qualifying for carer's allowance were in receipt of another social welfare payment in their own right or as a qualified adult on their spouse's payment. This is not the position today due to the increased income disregards I have introduced that allow carers on the higher joint family income to qualify.</P>
    <P>The review examined the purpose of the carer's allowance and concluded it is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. It noted that the primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual to ensure resources are not used to make two income supports payable to any individual. The review concluded, therefore, that the two income support payments should not be made in line with current practice. A person qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which he or she is entitled.</P>
    <P>The review proposed the introduction of a non-means tested continual care payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It is envisaged such a payment will be made irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement to carers caring for those in the highest category of dependency. The review considered that a needs assess<Col N="886" /> ment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced and that the continual care payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment to differentiate between the levels of care and care needs. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from the income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide relief or grants to those in care.</P>
    <P>Establishing a pilot system for needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme. This areas is the responsibility of my colleague, Deputy Moffatt, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The carer's benefit scheme became effective on 26 October 2000 and there are now 350 claims in payment. The scheme provides financial support for 15 months to a person who gives up employment to care full-time. As it is based on a person's PRSI contributions there is no means test. The scheme also allows carers to avail of a job protected leave of absence for a period up to 15 months. Legislation to protect the employment rights of the carer was introduced by my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, on 2 July 2001.</P>
    <P>I expect there will be approximately 400 carer's benefit claims in payment by the end of the year at an estimated cost of £1.7 million. It will take many years before this scheme reaches maturity but it is expected that there will be between 500 and 1,000 recipients under the scheme in the first number of years at an estimated full year cost of £5 million.</P>
    <P>A study to examine issues relating to long-term care both in terms of cost and possible partnership approaches and the possible role of the PRSI system in this regard has commenced. The study, which is being carried out by Mercer Ltd., will examine the strategic issues involved in the financing of long-term care. This involves an assessment of alternative financing and funding approaches and their feasibility in the Irish context. The study will encompass the financing of personal long-term care needs both in the community and in institutional care and the potential of the private sector or a combined public private sector approach to develop initiatives in this area. The study has been undertaken in consultation with the Departments of Health and Children and Finance. It is expected it will be published before the end of the year. There are ongoing discussions in Government regarding long-term care issues in the context of the health strategy which, according to my colleague, Deputy Martin, will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for the Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the type of services which recognise the value of the caring <Col N="887" /> ethos and provide real support and practical assistance to those who devote their time to improving the quality of life of others.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements in the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of the action programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister stating that he is not opposed in principle to the introduction of a continuous care payment and that the decision would have to be made about who receives this payment, and the various component payments, depending on need? Would he accept the need for the introduction of this payment on the basis that significant costs arise outside the giving of time to a loved one, family member or friend, including heat, food and associated costs? Will he state that he is not against such a payment in principle?</P>
      <P>How many people are in receipt of the carer's allowance, given last year's changes in the income disregard? In light of the forthcoming budget, would the Minister accept that a proposal to increase the income disregard to £350 for a married couple would significantly increase the number of people eligible to claim the carer's allowance and would bring the number up to 30,000 or 32,000? His Department suggests the figure is close to 55,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposed to a continuous care payment. I have indicated that I am in favour of such a payment. As regards the delivery of the carer's allowance scheme, my Department would not be in a position to determine who would or would not be entitled to a continuous care payment. As indicated in the 1998 report, there is a requirement for a needs assessment system operating in all health board areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, carried out a pilot project on this issue in his health board area, but this would have to be extended to all areas. Discussions on the health strategy include those on the more long-term issue regarding this area. I agree with the Deputy. I am in favour of this proposal and I appreciate the difficulties which exist in the area of caring.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Raising the disregard would cause difficulties for those existing on a social welfare income. The more one increases the disregard, the more one <Col N="888" /> favours those who have a non-social welfare income. I have to be aware of this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will anticipate my question. A continuous carer's allowance should be extended to those who become widows and continue to be carers. Those who become widows qualify for the widow's pension of £85 per week, but lose the carer's allowance, despite the fact that they are caring for a doubly incontinent, bed-ridden patient. Will the Minister not accede to the case I have made for two and a half years that those who become widows and continue to be carers should qualify for the widow's pension and the carer's allowance? The means test income limit is £125. Why is nothing being done about this anomaly in the carer's allowance system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I replied earlier to the issue of those in receipt of two payments. It is not a feature of the social welfare system that someone can be in receipt of two primary payments. I have some sympathy with the Deputy's point and I have examined this issue closely over the past year or so. This issue is not off the agenda. In view of the issue of equality, one could not restrict the payment to widows. One would have to include those on a single income lone parent allowance which would have greater implications than if the payment was restricted to widows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Minister has badly failed carers? This is mostly due to the fact that he did not even carry out the fundamental research. All recent studies, including those by the South Eastern and Mid-Western Health Boards, identify a wide ranging problem with which the Minister has not come to grips. Why did the Minister not carry out the research and set up a register?</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is a view among all agencies which operate in this area, such as Care Alliance Ireland, the Carers Association, NAMHI, Age Concern and so on, that we should do away with the hated, abominable means test? The Minister suggested this could be done for £132 million. Why will he not do so, as suggested by the leader of the Labour Party at our recent conference? Why will the Minister not give full recognition to the job of caring?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the carer's benefit. The carers leave legislation was introduced two and a half years ago, but only 350 people have taken advantage of it. Surely this shows that the Minister's development of carer's benefit has been a failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will we receive an interim report on the Mer<Col N="889" /> cer consultancy study in which this side of the House is interested? Has the Minister any intention of following, for example, the German model regarding a long-term care strategy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>My first question is simple. A respite care allowance is available to those who were carers on or about 5 June every year. There is an anomaly whereby someone who cares for a neighbour or friend will be left on the carer's allowance for six weeks after the death of the person for whom they cared. If someone dies within the six week period before 5 June, the carer will continue to receive the respite payment. A widow or widower who loses their spouse and who is a carer will not get that. I understand there are changes. I just want a commitment from the Minister that will be finalised and that anomaly will be removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision is made in the Social Welfare Act, 1998, for the payment of child benefit at 150% of the normal rate in the case of twins. In addition, a grant of £500 is payable at the birth of twins and further grants of £500 are payable when the twins reach the ages of four and 12. The purpose of these payments is to give recognition within the child benefit scheme of the special nature of such births and the additional costs associated with them. These payments apply to all parents of twins, including adoptive parents.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware of the intensive investment in child benefit initiated by this Government since coming into office, culminating in the three year investment programme launched in this year's budget. The first phase of increases paid in June raised child benefit by £25 per month for the first two children and £30 per month for the third and subsequent children. Similar increases over the next two years will raise annual expenditure on child benefit to £1.5 billion by 2003. Any further extension of the scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context, having regard to available resources and Government commitments.</P>

In advance of the budget and the Social Welfare Bill, will the Minister once again look at clearing up the anomalies that exist for the parents of mulitple births? I accept what he says in respect of Deputy Hogan's question on adopted twins but anomalies exist in the operation of child benefit for the parents of mulitple births. It is an area which is relatively insignificant in terms of cost and I hope in the run up to the budget and the Social Welfare Bill, the Minister will consider this matter in greater detail.</P>

As I have said before, over the period of this Government, I have endeavoured to fulfil all my commitments. Any objective analysis would show that we have delivered on literally every commitment we made. Obviously the issue of mulitple births is still under consideration but, as I said, the Minister for Finance indicated in last year's budget that over a three year period starting last year, we would be investing £1 billion in child benefit &ndash; a record increase. The issue of multiple births will be up for consideration, among other things, in the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>The Irish National Action Plan Against Poverty and Social Exclusion, covering the period 2001-03, is the initial Irish contribution to an EU-wide process made possible by a provision in the Treaty of Amsterdam proposed by Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Irish plan provides an overview of a wide variety of initiatives and is grounded in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the national development plan and the actions ensuing from these programmes. The plan is also the result of a wide consultative process.</P>
      <P>The deadline for submission of the plan &ndash; 1 June 2001 &ndash; preceded the completion of the ongoing review of the national anti-poverty strategy. In practical terms, this meant that the wide ranging policy developments being considered under the NAPS review could not be reflected in the action plan. This point was made explicitly clear to the EU Commission when the plan was being submitted.</P>
      <P>Following the submission of the report, the EU produced a draft joint inclusion report which drew on the national action plans submitted by all of the member states. The draft report provides a useful summary of the main features of the national plans and a valuable overall analysis of the initial steps being taken by member states to apply an open method of co-ordination to combating poverty and social exclusion throughout the EU. My Department is currently engaged in discussions with the EU Commission in relation to a number of issues arising from the draft report.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the submission he made to Brussels was correctly identified in the words of Fr. Sean Healy as an insult to poor people? Does he also agree that it has been severely criticised by the EU Commission? I will not go through all the criticisms or its critique but it points to the growing income disparity in our country which, I think, makes us the third or fourth most unequal country in Europe in terms of income. That has not been addressed. The Commission said the Minister has made no attempt to address the issue of spatial deprivation, of deprived areas in our cities and in rural areas. The Minister has done nothing to look at the deficiency in relation to the provision services, particularly in health and education. Is it not fair to say the Minister has been ticked off and slapped severely on the wrist by the EU Commission because he did not do his homework in relation to this submission? Fr. Healy got it right once again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with the Minister throughout the exchanges today is his failure to deal with criticism. The criticism does not come from Fr. Sean Healy; it comes from the EU Commission. Does the Minister accept that the Commission has poured scorn on the proposals that his Government has put to it to date? Specifically, there are no targets for social housing, no plan to deal with educationally disadvantaged school-children, no proposals to deal with the elderly and no gender analysis to tackle poverty amongst women. Given that the Minister and his colleagues will be in Brussels in November dealing with a two-day conference, and given that the EU Commission has such things to say about the plan that he believes to be superb, will he now change the plan he submitted last May?</P>
      <P>Ireland spends 16% of GNP on its contribution to social protection. This is the lowest figure in the EU where the average is 28% of GNP. That is the real litmus test of this Government's commitment to tackling poverty and social exclusion. We are at the bottom of the league.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter point, the Deputy <Col N="895" /> unfortunately is not fully aware of the facts. The reason Ireland has spent the lowest amount in relation to social protection in recent years &ndash; and not just during this Government's term in office &ndash; by and large has to do with having the youngest population in Europe. We do not have to pay for as many older people as, for example, Italy, which pays out a huge amount in pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>One of this Government's key objectives is the creation of an inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity and incentive to participate in the social and economic life of the country. The progress made in the fight against poverty in recent years can hardly be described as a betrayal of Ireland's poorest people. On the contrary, independent research undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute has shown that the level of consistent poverty fell from 15% in 1994 to 8% in 1998. We can expect that this trend will continue when the figures for 2001 are produced shortly. We are therefore well on our way to achieving our target of reducing the level of consistent poverty to below 5% by 2004.</P>
      <P>Having a job is recognised as the best route out of poverty and, as such, the dramatic progress which has been made in reducing the numbers of unemployed has had, and continues to have, a very beneficial impact on the overall numbers in poverty. Since June 1997, the live register has fallen by 44% and we will continue to work to meet the new challenges that recent events have put our way.</P>
      <P>It remains the case, of course, that social welfare payment rates are a central factor in determining trends in poverty. Budget 2001 provided for significant expenditure in respect of a range of social welfare measures with a full year cost of £850 million compared to £403.3 million in the previous year. In conjunction with taxation reforms, some of which will benefit those on lower earnings, budget 2001 has had a significant impact on the lives of those experiencing poverty. Allied to these developments, this Government has invested significantly in the public services and has specifically targeted poverty reduction through programmes such as the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and the RAPID, Clár and provincial towns initiatives.</P>
      <P>Of course, the trend in numbers falling below relative income lines is a matter of concern to this Government. There can be no doubt that sustained increases in relative income poverty can be an early indicator of future problems regarding social exclusion and this needs to be kept under continuous review. While it will be appreciated that I cannot pre-empt the forthcoming budget, I can assure the House that our commitment to the creation of a fully inclusive society will be further underlined when the details of the budget are announced.</P>

      <P>On the first public opportunity that I have, I congratulate David Begg on becoming general secretary of ICTU. It is another phase in one of the most distinguished trade union careers in Irish history. I look forward to his administration which will be a good one for Irish workers. Is it not amazing that, after 14 years of social partnership, in one of Mr. Begg's first public speeches in his new position, he finds it necessary fundamentally to criticise Ireland and com<Col N="897" /> pare it to a country like Denmark? Denmark has had a Labour government for most of its modern history and David Begg says of it, &ldquo;The levels of social cohesion&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The general secretary of ICTU has his play to make but I hope that he will insist that, for a change, when public pronouncements are made they are aimed at helping the less well-off. Over the years, union officials have always talked about tax but they have not talked so much about those on social welfare. No other society, when it is compared with any other European country, has been as successful at turning itself around. Unemployment was at 18%. Half of the population was reliant on social welfare. Now, due to the policies implemented by all Governments, but primarily by Fianna Fáil-led Governments, we have the lowest unemployment rate in the EU. Some 320,000 people who would otherwise have had to rely on social welfare have got jobs in the past four years.</P>
      <P>I repeat that the reason we come the lowest in terms of spend on social protection is for two good and simple reasons. They are that we have the youngest population and the lowest unemployment rate.</P>

He nearly believes it himself. <Col N="898" /> The Minister is right, we have the lowest unemployment rate in Europe but we also have the highest rate of relative income poverty and that is an issue we must address. Does the Minister not believe it is essential that future rises in social welfare should be related to growth in income instead of indexation alone? Growth in general income next year is expected to be about 8.5% whereas inflation will be between 3.5% and 4%. If we continually link it to inflation we will continue to increase the gap between the poorest and the well off.</P>
      <P>The Minister is correct in saying that countless national plans have done much good for our country but the poor are not part of those plans.</P>

They try to hide away from the fact that 320,000 people who would have relied on social welfare are now working. They hide away from the fact that record increases in child benefit have been given to people on social welfare, and they hide away from the fact that social welfare recipients are now in receipt of social welfare increases much faster than they were before this Government took office.</P>

There was a move on it, although it was surreptitious because the Minister may have been afraid to face the Minister for Finance openly. The wheel has now come full circle, so why will the Minister not agree to a minimum income standard of 27% of the gross average industrial wage, rising to 30%?

    <Title>Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Bill, 2001  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of an independent commercial statutory body to be known as the railway procurement agency. It will also provide for a single statutory railway order procedure for the approval of railway infrastructure projects, including the light rail and metro services. In addition, it will provide for the regulation of light rail services when they are operating on stream.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the Bill is on railway infrastructure. The provision of high quality infrastructure to support a reliable and efficient public transport is one of the greatest challenges facing us today. We are all well aware of the traffic congestion that has arisen in recent years due to the increased level of car ownership. That is continuing to grow at levels that could not have been imagined ten years ago. It is important to have an infrastructural system that will not threaten the development of our future economic prosperity. The Bill will enable such an infrastructure system to be put in place.</P>
      <P>Before the introduction of this legislation, many decisions were taken by the Government to improve the infrastructure system. The national development plan sets out a public transport investment strategy for the period 2000-2006 which is designed to achieve, among other things, a radical transformation of the public transport system. An investment of £2.2 billion in public transport is provided for in the plan. It is an unprecedented level of funding which has already enabled significant advances to be made, and will continue to do so in the years ahead. To date, for example, 275 additional buses have been acquired by Dublin Bus, 16 new DART carriages entered into service this year, and 60 Arrow rail cars have been ordered.</P>

      <P>During the past year there have been improvements in the Dublin-Maynooth railway line which have helped to reduce pressure on the roads.</P>
      <P>There has been further investment in safety. About 220 miles of track have been upgraded as part of the NDP programme, 189 level crossings have been improved and another 50 are being worked on. The number of bridges renewed is 190 and work on a further 45 is to be completed by the end of the year. Tremendous work and investment are being put into rail services.</P>

      <P>It is important that work goes ahead according to schedule. We are well aware of the disruption that any works, especially in a city, cause to the public. The people will accept disruptions provided they are aware that plans are being complied with and provided they know there will be an end to the disruption.</P>
      <P>We have had over a number of years, in my own area, the question of the reopening of a railway line from Cork to Midleton. Development of the east Cork area has taken off, especially in the past five years, and there has been tremendous growth in the towns of Midleton, Carrigtwohill and the whole hinterland area as a result of the booming economy. We have a motorway from Midleton to Cork which has improved travel and the Lee tunnel has helped in improving traffic congestion. Continual growth and development are likely to cause problems unless there is further infrastructural development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cobh-Cork rail line was upgraded and new carriages were added. It has been a tremendous success and the number of people travelling from Cobh by train has increased enormously. People from the Midleton, Cloyne, Whitegate and Carrigtwohill areas even drive to Glounthaune or <Col N="903" /> Little Island and get the train to Cork. These people would love to have the service available from Midleton.</P>
    <P>The development of Kent Station is also in the pipeline. I understand that money has been put aside to develop the station and the Cork-</P>
    <P>Midleton, Cork-Mallow, Cork-Blarney lines and to put in new signalling. The relevant authorities in Iarnród Éireann should get started on the work.</P>
    <P>There was a vote on the CIÉ board about six years ago for the opening of the Cork-Midleton line. Nothing has happened. Times have changed and there is a new board now. All political parties are committed to the reopening of that line. Initial studies have shown it is feasible and I do not understand why there is a need for another feasibility study. Can Iarnród Éireann or CIÉ management tell us why this project is being held up? Is it being held up by the Munster region, the Cork region or by head office? I look forward to getting a note from somebody on that.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill, which is a step forward in the development of our infrastructure. We must look forward with confidence and not spread doom and gloom. The basics of our economy are sound. If our infrastructure is in place we will ensure that when there is an upturn we will be able to move forward. If it is not in place we will not be in a position to take full advantage of any change. Our philosophy and policy is to continue building our infrastructure, rail, road, water systems, telecommunications, etc., so that when the world economy improves we will be in a position to benefit.

He will, I know, agree with most of the proposals I intend to make and the difficulties we have with rail development into the region.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be critical of Iarnród Éireann but there is one thing I find astonishing. The timetables for all railways changed in early September but the timetables became available to the public only in mid-October. I do not know where the blame lies but this blunder sums up the inefficiencies of Iarnród Éireann over recent years. Inefficiency must be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to western development the report on the state of the west dealt with a number of issues concerning rail infrastructure into the western region. It stated, &ldquo;The National Development Plan recognises the lack of development in rail <Col N="904" /> infrastructure which significantly erodes its competitive position as a mode of transport in comparison to the road network.&rdquo;  The line coming into the west is the line from Dublin to Sligo which takes three hours and ten minutes. In the last general election Mrs. O'Rourke came to Sligo like Granuaile, promising that if she became Minister for Public Enterprise she would resolve the problem of the Sligo-Dublin railway line, but it still takes three hours and ten minutes to get from Dublin to Sligo, just as it did four and a half years ago.</P>
    <P>A hotel in Sligo, where the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, celebrated the 75th anniversary of the foundation of Fianna Fáil last Friday, has received several complaints from guests that a locomotive is left running all night in a nearby railway yard. The hotelier has been told that if the engine is turned off it will be in danger of not starting in the morning. As a representative of Sligo and Leitrim I have had to listen to this topic being discussed on the national radio channel for the past couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>The work on the track from Carrick-on-Shannon to Mullingar is welcomed but much work remains to be done between Carrick-on-Shannon and Sligo. The Fine Gael proposal for the development of the west proposes a commuter service from Carrick-on-Shannon to Sligo and other towns in the region. We are a long way from achieving this because of the Government's unwillingness to provide the necessary investment. The journey from Dublin to Westport and Ballina, with which Deputy Moffatt is familiar, takes four hours. Last Friday week two interns, one of whom works for me, left Dublin by train to go to Westport. The train hit a cow &ndash; a regular occurrence on that line &ndash; but the passengers were left on the train for three hours with no information and then moved by coach. I do not know why so many cows are hit by trains on this line but the lack of co-ordination between Iarnród Éireann and the Department is difficult to understand. I hope someone will take responsibility for dealing with these situations.</P>
    <P>The Dublin-Galway train takes two hours and 30 minutes and the Dublin-Ennis-Limerick train takes three hours and 15 minutes. These journey times need to be reduced. We have become a commuter society and the development of our rail corridors is vitally important.</P>
    <P>A feasibility study should be carried out on the western rail corridor. The State of the West report states clearly what should happen. The western rail corridor, for passenger and freight, should run from Sligo or Ballina to Limerick with onward connections to the south west and the port of Rosslare. In the context of the national spatial strategy this route could prove valuable in linking the towns of the western region, thereby enhancing the development of critical mass. It would allow for the possibility of the development of tourism on the railway route and would diversify tourism growth to more inland regions. Several sections of the track, which are still in the <Col N="905" /> ownership of Iarnród Éireann, need to be upgraded significantly. These are the Collooney-Claremorris, the Claremorris-Athenry and Athenry-Ennis sections. To open up and upgrade the western rail corridor from Collooney to Ennis, which would allow passenger traffic at speeds of 60 to 70 miles per hour, would cost in the region of £100 million. This includes the cost of ancillary works. This corresponds to less than 1% of the transport initiative which has been taken in Dublin and shows, once again, the Government's lack of commitment to the development of the western region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss our rail infrastructure. I appreciate that much good work is being done at present and has been done for several years. I acknowledge that it is the ambition of the Minister for Public Enterprise to give the country a rail network which would provide us with the service we all wish to see. The present rail network is being replaced in many parts of the country. The old jointed track is being replaced by a continuous welded track which will allow trains to travel considerably faster and make life easier for everyone.</P>
      <P>The only decent rail tracks in the country are those running from Dublin to Cork and from Dublin to Belfast. The Dublin-Cork line is excellent. The journey of 160 miles can be travelled in two and a half hours. I would like to see other parts of the country enjoying a service of a similar standard. If I travel by rail from west Waterford to Dublin I have to motor either to Waterford city or Thurles. My preferred option is to go to Thurles because I can travel from there to Dublin in an hour and 15 minutes by fast train whereas the fastest train from Waterford to Dublin takes two hours and 20 minutes in the early morning and two hours and 40 minutes later in the day. That is not an acceptable time for a journey of less than 100 miles. The train makes numerous stops on the way, making the journey very unpleasant. We should be able to provide direct rail services between all the large urban centres and Dublin.</P>
      <P>The road system is so bad that it is no longer desirable to travel by road to Dublin. Traffic congestion in Dublin is dreadful, the standard of the roads throughout the country is so poor that they are dangerous and it takes an inordinate length of time to cover the distance. A road journey from my home to Dublin takes more than three hours. A fast train should be able to travel from Waterford to Dublin in one hour and 15 minutes, but at present the train takes a minimum of two hours and 20 minutes. This is highly unacceptable. The journey from Thurles to Dublin is only ten miles shorter but it takes only one hour and 15 minutes by train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has been made more serious by the opposition to the efforts of the National Roads Authority to provide dual carriageways to five major urban centres. If the current agitation means that the plans are set back by several years <Col N="906" /> the situation will become even more critical. It is highly desirable that the rail network be brought up to standard as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been helpful in her replies to date. Will she indicate when the works to upgrade the rail system will be completed for each of the centres involved? The agitation against the road development is highly undesirable and I condemn it. We need a proper road network.</P>

      <P>We need a safe road network. It is despicable that people should delay this development for their own selfish monetary gain. I sympathise with the Government, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the National Roads Authority in this difficulty. I hope the Minister for Public Enterprise can help us by providing a proper rail network as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>We realise the value of a good rail service when we see property values in areas 50 or 60 miles from Dublin going up because they have access to Dublin by rail. People can now commute to Dublin from as far away as Thurles. We see houses advertised in areas such as Portarlington, Portlaoise and other towns within 40 or 50 miles of Dublin. These towns have become prime development sites because of their access to the railway. The railway should be extended to make Dublin readily accessible to all major urban centres. It is all about access. People want to get from A to B quickly. We in Waterford find it difficult to attract industrialists to the city because of the poor rail service and exceptionally poor road from Dublin. The Minister will have used it.</P>
      <P>Several months ago I tabled a parliamentary question to the Department of the Environment and Local Government but did not receive a reply, so perhaps the Minister could investigate the following matter. The best sources of information tend to be taxi drivers. Recently, a taxi driver who was involved in public transport for many years informed me that a tunnel system already exists in this city.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le Fine Gael as a chuid ama a roinnt. This Bill has been referred to as the Luas Bill and the railway procurement agency Bill. However, it addresses a compendium of issues and provides us with an opportunity to see railway infrastructure in its totality. It refers to safety on the railways, unlawful use of railways and a code of conduct. I will focus on several of the issues arising from those aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Apart from the huge investment in infrastructure we have all been discussing today and yesterday, above all the railways need an element of public accountability. As the Minister is aware, I am a rail passenger, which gives me an opportunity to hear the views of other passengers, some of which are expressed quite angrily. The Bill proposes to establish a procurement agency. Will this mark the start of the kind of public accountability passengers want in terms of how Iarnród Éireann and other companies associated with rail transport provision operate?</P>
      <P>As I mentioned yesterday, I have learnt from correspondence with Iarnród Éireann that there is a passenger charter. I have not yet seen it displayed at stations. It should be displayed, but I have a feeling certain people might oppose such a move because passengers would not be pleased to learn that under the passenger's charter a train is not declared late if it arrives within 15 minutes of the published time and the driver is not obliged to make an announcement until such time is reached. This is unacceptable. In this day and age people need to be told of a delay, regardless of its duration.</P>
      <P>Late trains are no longer acceptable. As members of the EU we aspire to the same standards as other member states. I vividly recall, during a visit to Switzerland, a person standing at the end of a platform with his hand aloft waiting to press a bell as soon as the second hand of a clock reached the appointed time of departure. As the bell rang, the train moved off. The Swiss are famous for that level of punctuality. We should be just as efficient.</P>
      <P>Contracts must also be delivered on time. Luas is probably the most famous of these projects because of the various plans which were changed causing deadlines to be repeatedly pushed back. There is a sanction available to people who are not satisfied the Government has delivered on these contracts, the general election, which is the ultimate sanction available to us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Companies which default, delay, experience cost overruns or fail to comply with the tender they submitted in any other way should be subjected to penalty clauses. Had we been stricter in these matters in the past, the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business might not be so bogged down with the mini-CTC inquiry now. This is preventing the committee from examining the detail of the Aer Lingus dispute and various other public transport and energy matters, including Sellafield. We should learn from our experiences so as not to repeat our mistakes. I hope the <Col N="908" /> procurement agency will do so. That remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>The customer also requires accountability. The UK has an office for public complaints concerning public transport staffed and financed by the Government. We have a broadcasting complaints commission, a victims support commission and a Garda complaints commission. Rather than expressing themselves by firing off missives to the Minister or Members, we need a new vehicle to allow customers to deal with their growing and justified frustration with public transport services. Voluntary attempts are being made to set up railway user groups and transport user groups, all of which are valiant and hard working. However, they are not able, nor should they be expected, to match the type of resourcing available to other bodies such as the Garda and broadcasting complaints commissions.</P>
    <P>I belong to a cross-party group of Members from Dublin north which is urging the Minister to accept the case for a transport users group. We constantly receive various suggestions and reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ellis. I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to speak on the issue of rail infrastructure, which is a very topical matter not only in the capital, but throughout the country. Historically, we have consistently undervalued our railways. In more recent times, however, we have started to appreciate the legacy left to us in terms of railway construction. It baffles me that we are stuck in a mind set which does not envisage building further permanent routes. We will have to change it.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of the exact cost factors involved. However, building a motorway requires a 200 metre wide strip of land along the entire length of the route. I understand it would be equally cost effective and efficient to build railway lines because of their nature. In the long-term, they are a worthy investment from the point of view of both the environment and efficiency. We talked about public-private partnerships for road development and the potential for including tolls to fund further road development. There is a case for allowing private companies to come in when they are willing to put their money where their mouth is in order to further enhance the existing infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If development is to be moved from the east out to the west and to the north-west which has a deficiency of population, the rail infrastructure is a very important factor in the success of that development. We should examine all the aspects <Col N="909" /> and not become stuck in the old mindsets of using the railways only as they are and not developing them. We would be remembered in years to come as the people who oversaw that transition.</P>
    <P>CIÉ has recently commissioned a feasibility study on the development of a rail link from Midleton to Cork and a commuter service up the Dublin track as far as Mallow. I welcome that but I am disappointed that we now have to wait for another feasibility study. We are up to our necks in feasibility studies on the rail services in Cork. There has been huge development in recent years on the eastern side of the city, particularly in Midleton, with the potential for further expansion in Carrigtwohill. It would be very timely for CIÉ to go full steam ahead and make an application for funding. The population base is there and so are the resources. I am disappointed that CIÉ has used the stalling tactic of a feasibility study.</P>
    <P>I am confident that when the study is completed that we will get the support of Government to move immediately ahead and develop a proper commuter service from Midleton and perhaps even further to Youghal. It would open up Carrigtwohill and could extend up to Mallow and open up the stations at Kilbarry, Monard, Blarney and Rathduff. That would present an opportunity to implement the greater Cork area strategic plan which has been commissioned and passed by both local authorities. That plan specifically pinpoints the railway line as the focus for industrial and population development. CIÉ has no excuse for not moving ahead to ensure the plan is put in place as soon as possible. It would be of huge benefit to the city itself.</P>
    <P>A decision has been taken to stop further encroachment on the green belt in the Cork area and to advance towns such as Fermoy, Mallow, Midleton, Carrigaline and Ballincollig. They would use the lines and the public transport system to feed into the city.</P>

It will allow the citizens of Dublin to put up with the inconvenience in the knowledge that they will <Col N="910" /> have a proper, modern public transport system in place in a number of years. It is important to inform the public. People are patient and understanding if they know something positive will come out of the present works. It is a huge undertaking and I know the Minister and the Government are very committed to it. There is no capital city in the world without a proper public transport system. It is time that Dublin finally should take its place among the capital cities of Europe with a modern infrastructure.</P>
      <P>I am fascinated to be informed by Deputy Deasy and his taxi driver, who is obviously a historian, that there are tunnels in existence in Dublin. There has been a debate about whether the system should be underground or overground but whatever is the most practical is the correct way to go. The decision has been made and we should all support this development and hope that it comes in on time and that we will see a modern, vibrant infrastructure in place in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Bill is very comprehensive on the issue of safety and the unlawful use of the rail network. I ask if it can be envisaged that a private company will be allowed to buy rolling stock and run a train on the existing railway lines. I believe it is an idea that could be investigated further. It would not be privatisation, rather competition. There would still be a State-run business but it would have a competitor. As people travel more they see that competition is not to be feared but to be embraced.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing this Bill to the House. I hope that CIE will move full steam ahead with the development of the Midleton rail line and the commuter facilities from Kent Station out to Mallow. I hope it will address the infrastructural deficits and allow the greater Cork area study and the county and city development plan to shape Cork for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis:</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome this Bill and the opportunity to make comments on the rail infrastructure and the development of the national railway system both in city and rural areas. When this Minister came into office, suggestions were being made that certain railway lines should be downgraded and that there should be no expenditure on them. The railway line that I am most familiar with was one of those singled out for special treatment and suggestions were made that it should be mothballed or even closed down. The Minister in her wisdom gave a commitment prior to the last general election that if she were to be Minister in the future she would ensure that the line was brought up to a proper standard. She has kept her promise. She has put in the investment and by the end of next year, Dublin to Sligo will have a totally new and upgraded rail system. We may not yet have the carriages that are needed but at least we have the track and the opportunity <Col N="911" /> for Iarnród Éireann to upgrade the standard of the carriages. That needs to be done urgently.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a few comments about Iarnród Éireann and how it operates on the Dublin to Sligo line. Every bank holiday weekend there is absolute chaos. Passengers end up standing on trains travelling to Sligo on the Friday and returning to Dublin on the Monday. Iarnród Éireann should examine if it could provide extra carriages at times when it is aware there will be extra passengers travelling. Failure to do so shows a lack of management strategy regarding rural destinations, especially at peak times.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann should favourably consider providing a late evening and early morning service on the Dublin-Sligo route seven days a week. There is a need for a train to depart from Dublin at 9 p.m. or 9.30 p.m. which would arrive in Sligo at around midnight. The flyer which departs from Sligo on Monday at 4.30 a.m. or 5 a.m. should operate for the remaining four working days. This needs to be addressed, if we are to help to reduce the volume of traffic on the roads from the north west to Dublin. If such a service was available, many would use it rather than their private cars.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann is not doing the best it could in seeking to transport freight business. It should be able to compete favourably for quite an amount of freight business if it were to provide the necessary handling facilities along the route at Sligo, Carrick-on-Shannon and Longford, which would make it attractive to send goods by rail rather than by road. It would also help to alleviate the volume of traffic on the roads.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the way she has tackled the problems facing her. Her predecessor suggested that the Dublin-Sligo railway line should be mothballed. We have one mothballed railway line in Sligo-Leitrim, the line from Sligo to Claremorris and on to Limerick. That line should be examined with a view to reopening it. There is probably sufficient business available for it to be viable. If we want to develop the west, this proposal should be examined.</P>
      <P>I express my appreciation to the Minister for her being prepared to consider favourably the provision of a commuter service from Ballymote to Sligo to serve south Sligo. As the rail system there is unused for a large part of the day, a local service could be easily provided to help further alleviate traffic problems. Such a service would enable people from south Sligo who must commute by car to Sligo to commute by rail, which would help to alleviate the traffic chaos in Sligo town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all delighted that work on the Luas is progressing. The fact that it will give commuters a greater service within the greater Dublin area will encourage people to use it rather than their private cars, which will help to alleviate the traffic problems in the city. Anyone who studies this subject will realise there is a need for a rail ser<Col N="912" /> vice in order that people will not have to bring their cars into the city.</P>
    <P>We want to make sure that there will not be overruns on the Luas project. We are aware of the position regarding the mini-CTC project which is the subject of an inquiry. If proper management had been applied by Iarnród Éireann, there would not be a need for an inquiry into the project. It was negligent in not bringing the problem to the Minister's attention until it was an absolute mess and it had to divulge it. The way it handled that matter was wrong. There is a need for accountability from Iarnród Éireann to the Minister who is not responsible for the day-to-day running of any of the institutions within her remit. When I heard some of the comments during Private Members' Business last night I felt like saying the Minister would want to have 40 heads to keep track of the various semi-State organisations which come under her umbrella.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis:</NameTxt>
      <P>In keeping windows open, the Minister would be blown across the spectrum. There is a need for semi-State companies to keep the Minister of the day informed on a regular basis. There are chief executives and boards of directors of semi-State companies, but in many cases they do not seem to get down to the nitty-gritty of day-to-day operation of the organisation that is necessary to keep everybody informed. The only time we ever hear about anything in this House is when there is a crisis, and we are aware of all the crises that have arisen.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus is a crisis that has been waiting to happen for years, but nobody in the organisation took a decision to examine what needed to be done in that very competitive business. The same applies to any other transport provider. This issue must be addressed, if we are to maximise the effort that has gone into providing a new rail system and for rail safety. Some 88 miles of track were replaced in 1999, 84 miles in 2000 and 57 miles up to September 2001, making a total of 229 miles since 1999. Fencing works, bridge renewal works and works on level crossings have been carried out. We are lucky that major tragedies did not occur at level crossings due to defective lines. The incident at Knockcroghery, where thankfully nobody suffered to any great extent, was a warning that was heeded by the Government regarding the need for rail safety and rail upgrading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to ensure the light rail system that will operate in Dublin will run on time. If the service is to operate every five to ten minutes, those responsible for running it must be held to account to this House or its various committees to ensure it runs on time. One can stand at a bus stop for 25 to 30 minutes and three buses, which should have arrived at ten minute intervals, may all arrive together. The situation needs to be addressed. It shows a lack of management and organisation. If one was to drive around the city, <Col N="913" /> one could observe that to be the position on many routes. The bus lanes are clear for quite a length of time, but then three buses travelling to the same destination may arrive at the same time and in another 30 minutes another three buses may arrive at the same time. We all understand there may be traffic problems or a hold up, but I cannot understand how three buses may arrive one after the other when they should have arrived at ten minute intervals.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to have made a few comments on what is happening. This Bill is important and the proposed Bill on rail safety is equally important. I encourage the Minister to try to ensure that Bill comes before the House at the earliest possible date. Rail safety and safety in general affect each and every one of us. As legislators and ordinary citizens, we have a duty to make sure the public are protected. I hope that whatever is necessary is done to ensure the rail safety Bill comes before the House as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The debate on this Bill is flawed as it seeks to establish an agency which is profoundly undemocratic, non-transparent and unanswerable to the Oireachtas and the people. The Railway Procurement Agency will provide the Minister with a cop out in answering for the activities and responsibilities of the agency. That it will only be required to report to a committee of this House every now and again is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>We should learn from the ongoing dispute between the National Roads Authority and the people who live in the areas where the authority is building roads. We must learn from that case that the citizens of this country demand more by way of accountability and transparency from the State agencies. Everybody in this House is aware that the NRA is one of the most unanswerable agencies in existence. It is not answerable to this House, the Minister or, ultimately, the people. It operates behind closed doors, as will the Railway Procurement Agency which the Minister wants to establish under the Bill.</P>

    <P>When the Labour Party was in government it spearheaded the introduction of the Freedom of Information Act, which sought to open up the operation of Government, and its agencies, to the public by making it account for its decisions and actions in Parliament and beyond. This Government, however, has failed to adopt such an ethos. Instead, it puts every possible obstacle in the way of Opposition Deputies seeking answers from Ministers. Last night, for example, I tried to get answers from the Minister for Public Enterprise about the postal service in my constituency only to be told she had no responsibility for it. If the Minister does not have responsibility for the postal service, I do not know who has. This Bill seeks to remove from the Minister responsibility for answering in this House for the activities and projects of the railway procurement agency. For <Col N="914" /> that reason my party will table amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider the use of existing unused railway lines throughout the country. The thrust of the Bill relates to the acquisition of new railway infrastructure. What about the existing rail infrastructure which may have fallen into disuse and disrepair but which would serve to expand the rail network if the necessary resources were provided? A case in point is the Killarney to Kenmare line. If reactivated, it would be of enormous benefit to local people, not to mention the tourism industry which is in difficulty at present. Many Members of the House will be familiar with the Tralee to Blennerville line, which was opened a number of years ago to ferry tourists to and from a number of tourist attractions. It has been extremely successful. There is another railway line to Cahirciveen. There are many such lines and the Minister should examine the feasibility of using existing lines as well as developing new lines.</P>
    <P>Many of the old lines were located in very beautiful parts of the country and they would be a tourist attraction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as is the Killarney to Kenmare line. A study of these lines should be carried out to assess how they can be used for the benefit of the local population. If somebody from Valentia Island has an appointment in Dublin at 12 midday, he or she must get up at 5 a.m. to make that appointment. It could be 12 midnight when they get home. A rail service in that area would be extremely beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have much time. Otherwise, we could discuss the beauty of Kerry.</P>
      <P>Another important issue which has not been discussed is the ludicrous plan of Irish Rail to reduce by 46% the volume of freight carried on the rail system. This proposal will result in people dying on our roads. It is unbelievable that, at a time of so much public concern about the number of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles and the damage they are causing to the environment, Irish Rail should even consider dropping so much of its freight business. The result of this proposal will be the transfer of approximately 1.25 million tonnes of freight from the safe and environmentally friendly rail system to the already overcrowded and inadequate road system. It will mean many thousands of additional lorry journeys, many through small towns and villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has an obligation to intervene directly in this regard. If necessary, additional investment should be provided to prevent this disastrous transfer of freight from <Col N="915" /> rail to road. The Minister must review the proposal immediately.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is access for people with disabilities to public transport, particularly trains. I am sure the Minister heard the horror story of the young student who was travelling to Dublin from the west of Ireland by train one Sunday night some weeks ago. She had immense difficulty getting on to the train at her local railway station and she was obliged to travel in the guard's van because there was no suitable carriage for her wheelchair. When the train arrived in Heuston Station, her friend left the train in search of a ramp so she could disembark. That took so long the train emptied and started to leave the station again. Luckily, the girl in the wheelchair had a mobile phone and was able to contact her friend and have the train stopped. The use of the rail system by people with disabilities must be a priority. The incident I mentioned is just one example of the difficulties faced by people with disabilities who use public transport.</P>
    <P>The Bill is flawed in that the agency it provides for will neither be accountable or transparent. We do not want another National Roads Authority. There is difficulty with the National Roads Authority throughout the country. We cannot get answers from the authority and we should get answers when public money is involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the 36 Deputies who contributed to the debate. That is a huge number of contributions. The Bill is basically about procurement for Luas and the metro but it gave rise, quite rightly, to huge debate about rail lines in Members' constituencies. There is a dedicated group of railway buffs, as it were, but the contributors were not railway buffs. They are people who know their areas, where there are tracks, the state of existing tracks and carriages, the journey times for trains and what is required in the local rail service. It all made for a most interesting debate. I was present for more than three quarters of the contributions and they made interesting listening.</P>
      <P>Trains generate amazing interest. Many of the speakers in this debate made the point that everybody fell in love with cars. Everybody thought they would not get a motor car under their bottoms quickly enough. If it was not that, it was a case of wanting a second and third car. This happened throughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Nobody figured that the roads would get crowded because road space was limited and nobody wondered how we could continue in that way. It was only in recent years that the need for dependence on the railways arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many speakers talked about new lines and reviving existing disused lines. I will explain the situation as it was when I took this job in 1997. I do not intend to criticise the previous Government because all Governments that neglected the <Col N="916" /> railways over the past 25 years were at fault. In 1997 there was a crash in Knockcroghery, County Roscommon, within three months of my appointment to office. Nobody was seriously injured but there could have been 100 fatalities. The train was not overcrowded but it was full and it went off the line. It was buttressed by two small cliffs in the area. If the incident had not happened at that area, it could have been hugely serious.</P>
    <P>The accident happened on a Saturday and I went to look at the scene. I came to the Cabinet meeting the following week and said an independent rail study would have to be carried out. The study reported on all the rail lines that required work. It involved relaying lines, as Members who have seen that work taking place in their constituencies mentioned. It was a programme costing £500 million just for track renewal, level crossings and bridges during the five years of 1999 to 2003. The repair of lines in other areas under the safety programme is to continue for another five years.</P>
    <P>The independent engineers who carried out the study, IRMS, laid out how much was to be spent and, more importantly, the priority in which the money was to be spent. I am bound by that programme not only from the point of view of rail safety but because the House approved it. We are now working through that programme. I make that point to outline the position for Members who have made cases for defunct lines in their areas, such as the Cahirciveen line mentioned by Deputy Moynihan-Cronin which has been defunct for about 50 years. My first task is to complete the safety programme. I would fail in my duty if I did not do that.</P>
    <P>However, there is a definite need to look at stations that were closed, such as Monasterevan which has been rebuilt and opened at a cost of £2.5 million, where there are tracks which are used by trains but at which the trains do not stop. It is what one might call commuter line traffic. There is a great need to look at where this can happen. The LUTS study in Cork was mentioned by Deputies Stanton and Creed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have loved to discuss the matter, but the Minister stood up too early and I missed my slot by half a minute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not jump up. Somebody who must not have known the Deputy was coming asked me to stand up. I know the Deputy shares my interest in the LUTS study. Many Deputies, including Deputies Stanton and Creed, have tabled questions on the matter. The first phase of the Government's railway policy was to try to put the house in order by laying track costing £500 million. It must be remembered that we started from a low base and a huge amount of work was necessary. The second stage is to examine the studies that have been done into the viability of commuter lines in Cork and Sligo and heritage lines which have been proposed by various tourism interests. We must consider if old lines should be revived. Deputy Keaveney wishes <Col N="917" /> there were trains in County Donegal when she hears Members grumbling that trains are late in their constituencies. It is a difficulty the people of County Donegal would be glad to have.</P>
      <P>The financing of the refurbishment of the rail network will be normal from now on. When I started in the Department it was thought that trains did not need money and that they could run on their own, on tracks that have been in place since 1848. Most of the tracks that had to be replaced were laid over 150 years ago. The thinking on this matter has come full cycle and people know that travelling by train is safer, less stressful and more suitable for working and eating. I am not saying that everyone should travel by train, as roads will always be needed. A decent and well-serviced train system is also needed. I mention safety as many Deputies asked the reason new lines are not being developed. It is more important to first ensure the lines we have are tight and right.</P>
      <P>Many contributors to the debate spoke about the need for a railway safety Bill, which I hope will be printed by the end of the month, or at the start of December at the latest. This important Bill will be debated after Christmas. The Bill establishing the Railway Procurement Agency will give shape to the railway system. The safety structure to be set up will be hugely important. The fact that the agency will be independent means that structures will be far better than those in the United Kingdom or other European countries.</P>
      <P>Deputies Ring and Cooper-Flynn asked me about the upgrade of the Castlebar-Westport line, which I understand is to be completed next year, in line with the railway safety programme. All recommended procedures will be followed. Deputy Kelleher spoke about the new railway lines and the names that may be given to them. Deputy Sargent spoke of delayed trains and the fact that if a train is 15 minutes late, it is still deemed to be on time. I understand this idea is employed in areas where trains may be late as a result of the upgrading of the line or safety restrictions. Thankfully, such delays are gradually being eliminated as the lines are being completed. Trains could not have run if there had not been safety restrictions when improving rail lines that were in bad condition. Deputy Deasy asked several questions, one of which related to the upgrade of the Dublin-Waterford line. Nine miles of that route are to be upgraded this year and the rest will be completed within the first tranche of the railway safety programme next year. As I was unable to get the exact information sought by the Deputy, I will send him a letter in reply to other matters he raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Railway Procurement Agency Bill will essentially deal with Luas and the new metro system. In response to Deputy Moynihan-Cronin's question, the agency will be accountable to an Oireachtas committee whenever the committee sees fit. The legislation ensures accountability by stating that the agency will have to attend a com<Col N="918" /> mittee when it is requested to do so. I do not know if the NRA will come to an Oireachtas committee, but the procurement agency certainly will. I freely admit that there should be accountability to elected representatives in both Houses, given that large sums of money are being spent on the railways.</P>
    <P>Deputies Seán Ryan and Brian Lenihan spoke this morning about north Dublin and the need for a metro line to the airport. There is no doubt that the first part of the metro proposals, which I hope will emerge after Christmas, will relate to the metro line between Dublin Airport and the city centre. We hope the aviation industry will improve, but the speed of the upturn is not the point, as there is a need for a rail link to the airport in any event. Such a link will happen and the Railway Procurement Agency Bill is needed to facilitate it. Luas has kept completely to schedule, which is very rare for an infrastructural project. When interim arrangements were made three or four years ago the date mentioned for completion was October 2003.</P>

      <P>I read debates from this House during the introduction of DART, although none of the Members present contributed. The exact same language that we have heard about Luas was used to argue that the DART would be a white elephant, that nobody would use it and that it would be a distraction and a destruction. Nothing like that happened, however, as the DART has proved to be an outstanding success. I do not doubt that Luas and the metro will be similar successes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> Returning to what I said at the beginning, I welcome the huge interest and level of debate about railways. It shows quite clearly that the priorities of elected representatives regarding what is needed throughout the country are quite right. A properly and decently run railway system is needed and the journey to provide such a system has commenced. We are about to enter the fourth year of the safety programme, which will cost £500 million and which is a necessary part of the journey. At the end of the fifth year, 2003, tracks will have been relaid and level crossings, bridges and other surrounding amenities will have been completed.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome what was said this morning about railway stations and those who run them, many of whom are women. Bright and smart people are employed in our railway stations, such as the station mistress in Athlone who is a delight in the way she does her work and the way she keeps the station. Deputy Ring mentioned the railway station in his area which is also run by a woman. I have nothing against men running railway stations, but women do a good job of it. They attend to the decor and order everyone around in a good way. They also make the trains run on time, which is remarkable. I thank the Members of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled these amendments on Committee Stage. <Col N="920" /> The Minister indicated then that there was no difficulty, in principle, with making these reports available in both the English and Irish languages, but that it would be at variance with other legislation where it was not specified. I have given that point consideration. Given that such importance is placed on the Irish language it might be useful to draw a line in the sand and state that from now on there should be an obligation to make these reports available in both languages. There is an explosion of interest in all aspects of Irish culture, particularly in the education sector where there has been an explosion of gaelscoileanna. There is also the knock-on demand for post-primary education through Irish. It would be keeping in step with that cultural revival and expression of interest in the Irish language which, in many respects, is now more prevalent in the galltacht than the Gaeltacht. Even if we have not referred in other legislation to the need for these reports to be available bilingually, it would be useful to put down a marker now and make it an obligation. I hope the Minister of State will respond favourably.</P>

It is also common practice to produce most annual reports as Gaeilge and in English. It would not be out of line and would be useful to write it into the legislation.</P>

    <P>Tá mé féin i m'ionadaí ar cheantar Gaeltachta. Oíche Aoine seo caite bhí mé ag imeacht mhór i Sraith an Úrláir ar raibh clubanna óige ar fud Dhún na nGall ann. Chuir sé íontas mór orm an méid acu a bhí ag caint tré Ghaeilge. Bhí daoine óga ann ó Chnoc Fola, Gaoth Dóbhair, Teileann, an Charraig, gan trácht ach ar cúpla áit. Má théann an Bille tríd gan aitheantas a thabhairt don Ghaeilge ní bheimid ag tabhairt aitheantais do chlubanna ar fud na Gaeltachta, i dTír Chonaill, i Mhuigheo, i nGaillimh, i gCorcaigh, i gCiarraigh, san Mhí nó i bPort Láirge. Tá clubanna taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a dhéanann a gcuid oibre tré Ghaeilge. Tá Club na bhFiann i mBaile Átha Cliath, mar shampla, do dhaoine a fhreastail ar Choláiste na bhFiann i gConamara agus a dhéanann a chuid oibre ar fad tré Ghaeilge. Ní bheadh sé sásúil ar chor ar bith muna mbeadh aitheantas tugtha do na clubanna ar fud <Col N="921" /> na tíre a dhéanann a gcuid oibre tré mheán na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá meas mór ar an nGaeilge ar fud na tíre agus tá sí ag teacht chun cinn. Tá Gaelscoileanna agus Gaelcholáistí ar fud na tíre agus ní thig linn neamh-íontas a dhéanamh dóibh siúd.</P>
    <P>Tá eagraíochtaí Stáit ar nós Bord Soláthar an Leictreachais agus boird Stáit eile a chuireann tuairiscí bliaintiúil ar fáil i mBéarla agus i nGaeilge. </P>
    <P>While I welcome this important Bill and compliment the Minister on introducing it, it will be defective if we do not recognise the activity in Gaeltacht areas and many other parts of the country where such clubs conduct all their business through the medium of Irish. We are told there are two official languages in this country, Irish and English, and that Irish is the first official language. We want to influence young people to respect Irish and use it if they can. We are not compelling them to do so. It is a free country and they can make that choice. We are focused on incentives rather than compulsion. It would be a tremendous example to all young people, regardless of whether they conduct their activities through Irish or English, if the report was bilingual. It is a reasonable amendment which should be considered sympathetically by the Minister of State. If he does not do so, the Bill will be defective.</P>
    <P>Almost every week on the Order of Business a Deputy from one party or another will ask about the up-to-date position on Bille na Gaeilge which will be introduced to give recognition to Irish. We are told it will be published by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. We have been waiting for it for four years and all hope it will be published. As my county colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Coughlan, is now in charge of operations, perhaps she will speed it up. It is illogical that while every Department presents its views in preparation for Bille na Gaeilge, this important Bill, which is relevant and important for our young people, does not recognise the Irish language. It should not only be there, but out of respect for the Gaeltacht people agus Gaeilgeoirí ar fud na tíre, sílim gur cóir go nglacfaí leis an mholadh seo.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State is a reasonable person. Some are not as fluent in the language as others, but the Minister of State should consider these amendments favourably and sympathetically. They are supported by every party on this side of the House. If my colleague from the Green Party was here, bheadh sé chomh dáiríre agus atá mé féin agus na daoine seo eile ag iarraidh intinn an Aire Stáit a dhíriú ar an leasú seo. The amendments would improve the Bill immensely. They would make the legislation relevant to those inside and outside Gaeltachtaí who are doing so much to promote the language on a voluntary basis. Most youth clubs operate on such a basis.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State's magnanimous acceptance of these reasonable amendments that have been tabled and supported by the Opposition parties. This is a recognition of the central role of the language in the lives of many young people, whether they reside inside or outside the Gaeltacht. I also hope it will become an accepted practice in similar legislation in future so that Members will not have to table such amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently visited Canada, which also has two official languages. Legislation and amendments in <Col N="923" /> the Canadian Parliament are published in both English and French. To have two official languages is the aim of our language Bill and before it is enacted we should adopt the practice of publishing documents in both our official languages, Gaeilge agus Béarla.</P>

      <P>The amendment results from submissions received by all parties from the National Youth Council and relates to the youth work functions of the Minister. While these functions are being devolved to vocational education committees the Minister has specific responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The amendment refers to the targeting of specific age groups and social and economic disadvantage. The National Youth Council suggests that references to particular regard for young people who are disadvantaged and to those aged ten years to 21 years should be separated. The wording should be amended in the appropriate sections, including section 8(3)(<i>b</i>), which would then read &ldquo;that particular regard is had for the youth work requirements of persons who have attained the age of ten years but not 21 years and for young people who are socially or economically disadvantaged in this age range&rdquo;. The Minister of State will appreciate this point as it has merit. He also indicated on Committee Stage that he would consider this issue for Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated this amendment on Committee Stage. The net point is that in terms of the publication by vocational education committees of youth plans for their respective areas, there appears to be some merit in ensuring that these plans coincide with the five-year term of vocational education committees after local authority elections. Is it fair to expect a VEC to be responsible for, and to take on board, a youth work plan into which it had no input and which may run for the first two or three years of its term of office? In terms of democratic accountability it is important that elected members are answerable to their electorates and, in this case, to the youth groups interested in the plans being produced by vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>However, it is hardly fair to inflict accountability on members of a VEC for a plan into which they had no direct input. These plans may be inherited by virtue of the overlap between three-year plans which run from the term of office of one VEC into that of its successor which may involve a substantial change in membership. It would be preferable if each VEC, as it commences its term of office after a local authority election, would be responsible for introducing its own plan for which it would be accountable to those interested in youth work and to the public at large. That is the reason for this amendment, to which there are three related amendments.</P>

Bhí mé féin ar choiste gairmoideachais ar feadh beagnach deich mbliana agus sílim gur chóir go mbeadh comhoibriú i gcónaí idir an coiste gairmoideachais agus lucht pleanála den chineál sin chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an aos óg. An pointe atá déanta ag an Teachta Creed, tá sé an-phraiticiúil ar fad, sé sin, go mbeadh an plean agus téarma an choiste gairmoideachais ag dul céim ar chéim, agus nach mbeadh ceann acu roimh an cheann eile nó ina dhiaidh.</P>
      <P>Is moladh réasúnta agus tá súil agam go mbreathnóidh an tAire go fabhrach air.</P>
      <P>I support this amendment. Like other Deputies I have been a member of a VEC for eight or nine years and it is logical and practical that the term of office of a VEC and any such plans, particularly those concerning young people, should run shoulder to shoulder rather than one being half a term ahead of the other. This would ensure that the members of a serving VEC are familiar with the plan from introduction to implementation. This amendment would result in such a situation which would be advantageous for the implementation of these projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the logic of what Deputies are saying and I studied this matter since Committee Stage. However, in the context of this amendment it is not considered necessary or desirable to increase the specified terms to five years as this longer cycle would reduce the momentum of co-operation and co-ordination for proper supervision by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>A five-year timespan is a long period in the informal youth sector where programmes and projects often operate for only one year. Increasing the period for another two years would also create additional pressures on youth worker assessors and would cause an inordinate delay in the production of their reports.</P>
      <P>Due to the progression of the age cohort on the youth front and the fact that the majority of the young people would have moved on from the intended catchment age group, the duration of a five-year plan is considered inappropriate. Therefore I have decided to adhere to the three-year duration in each case. The three-year period is also in tandem with the three-year period proposed under section 11 if a VEC has, in certain circumstances, to provide youth work programmes or services.</P>

      <P>I am loathe to divide the House on</P>
      <P>this issue but I listened to that logic on Committee Stage and have considered the Minister's position on this matter in the interim. I still think</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="926" /> the original point has considerable merit in so far as the review process for a youth work plan will commence perhaps in year four of a five year cycle, that is, if the amendment is accepted. The final adoption of a new youth work plan could be tailored in such a way that it would become the property of the newly elected vocational education committee. It is a bit rich to ask a vocational education committee to be accountable for a plan into which it has had no input.</P>
    <P>The reason for the five years is quite simply that we will have local authority elections every five years. They are a trigger mechanism for membership of vocational education committees which will be ultimately responsible. Surely it makes sense that members of a vocational education committee, who are responsible and who will be answerable, will not be able to throw their hands in the air and say this is a plan into which they had no input, although they are now sitting members of the VEC. At least if the plan runs for the duration of five years, the mechanism to begin to invite submissions for a new plan to begin in year four of a five year cycle and the final adoption being one of the first issues a new vocational education committee takes on board, one can move relatively seamlessly in a five year cycle.</P>
    <P>The Minister is going to diminish accountability and put members of a vocational education committee in a very invidious position if they are being asked to account for a plan which has, maybe in terms of their membership, two or three years to run and yet they are expected to be answerable for a policy into which they have had no input. It does not appear to be something on which it would be extraordinarily difficult to yield.</P>
    <P>We have moved from a position where local authority elections were held almost at the whim of the Minister with responsibility for local government &ndash; they went from five years to seven years and sometimes more. The elections are now fixed statutorily. It is probably time this House moved to a situation where elections were held on fixed dates every five years rather than have the uncertainly that regularly prevails and hinders the capacity of the House to work effectively. The same thing will happen at local authority and vocational education committee levels. The buzz words in politics today are openness, transparency and accountability, the goddess of OTA, as the Minister for Finance termed it on one occasion. That equally applies at local authority level. Let us not place members of vocational education committees in a position in which they are expected to answer for something over which they have no responsibility or into which they have had no input. That is the logic behind the amendment before the House.</P>

      <P>The amendment envisages a five-year plan instead of the three-year plan that I have proposed. I have opted for a three-year plan having regard to the programme of services in youth work, some of which may operate for one year only. Extending the plan to five years could make assessment almost impossible in some instances as the course-project participants could have left the informal youth work system. The three-year period also dovetails with the requirements for the assessor of youth work to assess at least once in every three-year period youth work programmes and services provided by voluntary youth organisations or funded by vocational education committees. The prescription of the National Youth Council of Ireland as the prescribed national voluntary youth organisation is for a period of three years, subject to renewal. Thus, there is a consistency in the Youth Work Bill, 2000, in relation to a three-year period of planning and assessment. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>The purpose of Deputy Upton's amendment would be to remove specific provision whereby three-quarters of the voluntary youth council will come from the volunteer sector or, to put it another way, not more than one-quarter will come from the paid youth sector workers. It seems to me that this strikes the right balance and that it takes into account, appropriately, the high input from volunteers in the youth work sector. Indeed, I have received a number of representations to uphold the representation of volunteers at local level. I am therefore satisfied that section 22(2) should remain as it is.</P>

      <P>I would be slightly concerned that if we leave it as it stands with a requirement for no more than a quarter of staff to be involved that it could present a situation where it would be extremely difficult to fill those posts by virtue of the exclusion of the volunteers. In the future it will be difficult to access enough volunteers. With the greatest respect for the work that is done by volunteers, their training and role on the committees is slightly different to that expected from trained staff members. There is nothing to be lost by leaving it open. There is no need to include an absolute requirement in relation to the division. It could be left such that it could be filled by appropriate or suitable people but should not be exclusive.</P>

I am advised that it is not necessary to include it in the legislation as youth work embraces all groups, including ethnic groups. My understanding is that a number of youth organisations have already included ethnic groups in their programmes. The Equal Status Groups Act, 2000, provides that no discrimination can take place on grounds of nationality. I understand what Deputy Upton wants to achieve here and I am personally sympathetically disposed towards it.

The wording of this section was arrived at after considerable thought and represents a logical sequence of prescription and future prescription. The Youth Work Act, 1997, did not prescribe on these lines and at that time the prescription of the National Youth Council of Ireland was done by ministerial order.

    <Title>Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>James Baldwin, a noted American writer on civil rights, wrote, &ldquo;not everything that is faced can be changed but nothing can be changed until it is faced.&rdquo; Today marks a further step by this House and Irish society to face the dark stain on our society, that is, past abuse of children in institutional care. We do so to help the victims and their families towards recovery and guard against any repetition of such callous abuse of children in care.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide financial awards for people who, as children, suffered abuse in residential institutions for which public bodies had responsibility. It is a Bill about the past, about facing up to mistakes made and providing some reasonable measure of financial recompense for people who were wronged as children.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also positive and forward looking. It is about redress. Dictionary definitions of &ldquo;redress&rdquo; include reparation or compensation for a wrong, atonement for a misdeed and setting a person upright again. The Bill is part of a range of initiatives taken by the Government to address the issue of child abuse which have all these elements of redress, compensation, atonement for past wrongs and helping people to set themselves up again.</P>
    <P>The other Government initiatives include the Laffoy commission to inquire into child abuse, which I established last year under statute. They also include the dedicated counselling services provided by health boards for all victims of abuse and the financial support provided by my Department and the Minister for Health and Children for victim support groups.</P>
    <P>It is important that we remember that this legislation is being enacted for some 30,000 people, born since 1930 who were committed by <Col N="936" /><Col N="937" /> the courts to industrial and reformatory schools. In addition to children committed by the courts, significant numbers were also committed to the industrial and reformatory schools by parents, and the schools often operated as orphanages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>Efforts to brand such children as juvenile criminals are both offensive and inaccurate. The majority of children in the institutions had committed no offence other than to be destitute, orphans or born to parents who simply could not provide for them.</P>
      <P>We do not know how many of those placed in the institutions are alive today. We do not know how many of them suffered abuse and carried the scars with them for many years. We do know that the number is significant. There are at least 3,000 people for whom their time in an institution was traumatic. All of these people who, as children, were placed in the institutions have carried the scars of their experience with them, often for a lifetime. From statisitics in my Department on cases pending before the courts we know that 10% of cases relate to children who were in the institutions in the 1930s and 1940s, while 26% relate to children who were in the institutions in the 1950s. These people are now in their sixties and older. It is hardly surprising then that many victims of abuse feel that it has taken Irish society a long time to address their needs or even to listen to them. It has to be said also that in a comparatively short space of time we, as a Government and as a society, have put in place a broader range of measures to address past child abuse than any Government or any society anywhere.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed by some that the setting up of a scheme for financial redress to victims of abuse in childhood will prejudice the effectiveness of the commission to inquire into child abuse. This is based on the view that former residents of the institutions will be encouraged to make their claim to the redress board only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot stress strongly enough that the commission and the proposed Residential Institutions Redress Board are separate bodies with very different functions. Both bodies are part of the Government's response to widespread public concern about alleged abuse in the institutions. They are intended as going some way to serving the needs of victims of abuse in childhood. Those <Col N="938" /> needs, as expressed to me and my Department by many former residents of the institutions, include the need to be believed. They also want answers as to the reason abuse happened to them and who were the responsible parties. Their needs also include, in some but by no means all cases, a wish to be financially compensated. I appreciate that the concerns are expressed from a genuine desire to see the Laffoy commission successfully complete its work. I have to say nevertheless that it is unfair to former residents of institutions to presume to know how they will act. As matters stand, the commission has a very substantial number of applications and many have already been heard. There is no evidence, to my knowledge, of a drift of applicants away from the commission.</P>
    <P>We also have to have regard to the reality of the lives of many of the former residents of the institutions. Waiting for the outcome of the commission's inquiries, however quickly it can carry them out, would in all likelihood mean waiting a couple of years before moving to address the issue of compensation. In that time there is no doubt, but that some former residents of institutions would die or become infirm. Others with claims for compensation would be forced to bring their claims through the courts with all the attendant stress of that process. It has taken us, as a society, long enough to recognise the serious injustices which our residential care institutions harboured. We should delay no longer in addressing the needs of people who, as children, were placed in these institutions.</P>
    <P>The compensation provided for in the Bill is through an <i>ex gratia </i>scheme. It involves no finding of fault and no declaration of liability. It is a scheme designed to address the fact that the institutions concerned in many ways departed from the normal requirements of child care while in custody. It acknowledges that because of this many people who were in institutional care have, through much of their lives, carried serious psychological scars. The scheme seeks to provide reasonable financial compensation for that injury. This approach has caused concern that awards will be made on the basis of untested evidence. This is not the case. Any person before the redress board must first establish that he or she is suffering or has suffered some significant injury, physical or psychological. Second, he or she must establish that the injury is consistent with the abuse as alleged. Both will involve sigificant medical and psychiatric evidence and the board may have assessments carried out.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to inquire in detail into the facts of abuse as alleged for a number of reasons. There will be the medically proven fact that claimants to the redress board have suffered damage consistent with abuse in childhood. It has to be borne in mind that these are people for whom, as children, public authorities had special responsibilities. Even if rigorous inquiries were to be made into allegations of abuse it is likely that a significant number of cases would be reduced to an adjudication between conflicting accounts <Col N="939" /> with no objective proof of either. Are such people to be denied compensation for injuries which are objectively verifiable? Such an approach would visit an injustice upon those who were genuinely abused in childhood and serve only to heighten their sense of continuing abuse.</P>
    <P>There is a very real concern among the religious orders, which were the owners and managers of the institutions, that the scheme we are debating today amounts to a significant injustice to them. As they perceive it, the injustice lies in the fact that the validation process, the practice which I have just outlined, will operate so as to associate all members who worked in the institutions in the past with abuse. This, they fear, will bring disrepute even to the members of the congregations today and it will all occur without giving the individuals concerned or the congregations an opportunity to defend themselves. I am very conscious of these concerns and wish strongly to allay their fears as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined why I consider the process for validating claims is reasonable in the circumstances and how the compensation scheme focuses not on the facts of abuse, but on current or past injury which is consistent with abuse. I am aware that in the ongoing debate about past child abuse it has been all too easy to characterise the congregations who managed the institutions as the villains. This is an injustice to the individual members of the congregations, both past and present, and does no service to the task we have set ourselves, that of facing up, as a society, to the mistakes of our past.</P>
    <P>While a complete account of institutional child abuse must await the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, we know that almost 30,000 people born since 1930 passed through the reformatory and industrial schools as children. Most of these were resident in the institutions for periods up to the end of the 1960s. Following the report of the committee on reformatory and industrial schools, chaired by Ms Justice Eileen Kennedy in 1970, most of the schools were closed.</P>
    <P>These schools have a long history. Their origins demonstrate the long policy and practice of neglect of children. Into that policy of official neglect stepped the religious congregations and other charitable organisations. Ever since the first industrial and reformatory schools were introduced to Ireland in the 1860s, religious congregations, Catholic and Protestant, undertook the difficult and largely unrewarded work of providing for children who suffered multiple disadvantages. Local and central government was only too happy to delegate this duty to them.</P>
    <P>Over time the situation improved, especially after the enactment in 1908 of the Children Act. However, as late as 1970 the Kennedy Committee found that the industrial and reformatory schools were housed in old and often unsuitable build<Col N="940" /> ings, the institutions were under staffed by under trained or untrained personnel, the emotional needs of the children were not catered for even though they came from backgrounds of deprivation, an institutional approach prevailed, and financial provision made by public bodies was inadequate as was the system of inspection.</P>
    <P>This litany of deficiencies was as much the fault of contemporary Irish society and its leaders, as it was the fault of managers of the schools who, in many cases, were making do with the few resources they got. Should it surprise us then that many children suffered emotional neglect, were hungry and poorly clothed, that corporal punishment was frequent and that the regime in most of the institutions could best be described as harsh.</P>
    <P>There is a need for balance and fairness in public debate on this very important subject. Religious congregations have made a significant contribution to Irish society, not least in the education of children. That we should allow that contribution and their contribution generally to the care and welfare of the most vulnerable in our society to be engulfed by the proper revulsion at institutional abuse is merely to seek to cure one injustice by creating another.</P>
    <P>None of this absolves those who abused children, or their managers and employers, of responsibility for the enormous damage done to young lives. Abuse of children in institutional care occurred and the State, together with the congregations concerned, is trying to find a reasonable response to it. The congregations are engaged in discussions with representatives of the State to seek a way in which they can make a contribution to this compensation scheme. I welcome the congregation's preparedness to engage in these discussions and trust they will be concluded successfully at an early date. Their involvement with the scheme represents the best option for providing a full response to past abuse and bringing this painful period in our history to a close.</P>
    <P>As published, the Bill applies to people who as children suffered abuse in orphanages, industrial schools and reformatory schools. It does not include victims of abuse in day schools. The decision to set up this compensation scheme as now proposed was taken after careful consideration of all the circumstances. The scheme is intended to address a very particular circumstance, namely, abuse in residential care. It is not, and was never intended to be, a panacea for every injustice committed on children.</P>
    <P>In May 1999 the Taoiseach, responding to the emerging accounts of abuse in residential care, expressed regret on behalf of our society for our collective failure to intervene, detect the pain of the victims of abuse and come to their rescue. He did so because most allegations and the most disturbing allegations have been made about these institutions and because public authorities had <Col N="941" /> formal and, in most cases, statutory responsibility, both for the placing of the children in the institutions and the regulation of the operation of the institutions. To a significant degree the State, through these public bodies, replaced parents as the natural protector and career of the children concerned. This placed a heavy responsibility on public bodies for their welfare. A similar responsibility did not apply in the case of children who attended ordinary schools and for the most part continued to live in their homes and communities.</P>
    <P>The nature of the institutions is also relevant to the decision to pay compensation from public funds to former residents. Unlike ordinary schools, the institutions removed the barriers which normally separate work, play and sleep and controlled every aspect of the child's life. Residents had little or no say in their lives. In the words of the Kennedy committee, &ldquo;The children in care are completely dependent on the residential home staff for all the love, understanding, security and religious formation they need, as well as for support in making their way in life&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Given the weakness and vulnerability of a child who has been deprived of parental care in such circumstances, the authorities mandated in law to protect his or her interests have a particularly onerous responsibility. Failure on their part can carry serious consequences for the children who have no other advocate. In the case of ordinary schools, public authorities did not have this level of responsibility and had no authority to exercise it in respect of schools which were privately owned and significantly independent. In the circumstances, the distinction now being made in the provision of financial redress, and in that matter only, between abuse victims in ordinary schools and victims in residential care institutions, is a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>In the Government's initiatives to address past abuse, the needs of those who suffered abuse in ordinary schools is recognised and provided for and a range of measures has been put in place to assist them. These include the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, dedicated counselling services in all health board areas for victims of abuse and the recent amendment to the Statute of Limitations. The latter initiative was taken keeping in mind the particular position of the victims of a convicted child abuser, who was a teacher in an ordinary school, and facilitated them in seeking financial redress in the courts.</P>
    <P>One of the functions laid down in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, requires the commission to advise the Government on the actions that may be taken to alleviate the damage suffered by people who were abused in childhood. The commission process is open to all persons who suffered abuse in childhood, except where the abuse occurred in a family home. The commission, in its conclusions, may have views on <Col N="942" /> how the effects of abuse in ordinary schools can be dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the callous and ignorant diatribe delivered by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, last night she signally failed to respond to one of the salient criticisms contained in the motion before the House. This wilful ignorance will surprise no one because Deputy O'Rourke's record as Minister for Public Enterprise has been a disaster. Her efforts to avoid accountability and responsibility by engaging in a juvenile rant that would be out of place in a school yard, let alone a national parliament, are testament to her failure. I will remind her of the facts.</P>
      <P>Over 2,000 workers in Aer Lingus are to be thrown onto the dole queues. The Minister's supposed concern about the workforce is undermined by her complete failure and that of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance to fight in Brussels to secure State aid. The Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance do not believe in State aid and the Taoiseach does not believe in anything that does not have the imprimatur of the previous pair, and the Minister does not believe in anything except her own ego. The European Commissioner, Spain's answer to Margaret Thatcher, is determined to see the dismantling of Europe's airlines and the Minister, Ireland's answer to Margaret Thatcher, will not stand in her way. Aer Lingus workers and their families will have to pay the price.</P>
      <P>The Luas project was stopped in its tracks by the Minister and the Tánaiste. The project was put into cold storage while the hare-brained scheme of driving a Luas tunnel beneath Dublin city centre was examined. EU funding and public faith in the project was lost. As a result, it will be another 25 months at least before one Dublin commuter is carried on a Luas carriage.</P>
      <P>The ESB's bid to enter the Polish market was blocked by the Government at the behest of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. The ESB had invested a huge amount of time and resources in this excellent project. The decision was a huge blow to the morale and confidence of everyone in the ESB. The Minister knew well the effect this cowardly decision would have on the company, yet she did not lift a finger to defend a semi-State company which was determined to adapt and grow in the new European market conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even this arrogant and bombastic Government no longer has the brass neck to defend the Eircom flotation. There is the complete absence of a reference to the flotation from the Government's face-saving amendment to the motion this evening. The flotation was a great symbol of Deputy O'Rourke's tenure in the Department of Public Enterprise. Her enthusiasm to jump on board in every photo opportunity and PR gimmick associated with the flotation was unbounded. When the going got tough, however, the Minister got going and refuses to account for her role in the ripping-off of up to 500,000 small investors and the eventual transfer of ownership <Col N="946" /> of the company to a handful of media conglomerates for a song.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the Government's bizarre decisions in relation to the operation of the BNFL plant at Sellafield have been laid bare in this House. The Government inexplicably disbanded the expert legal and scientific team assembled to lead the campaign against the plant. It also mothballed the inter-ministerial committee initiative. This incompetence and laziness let BNFL off the hook. As a result, we are now faced with the prospect of the huge MOX plant being commissioned in this ready-made nuclear weapon just miles off our coast. On each and every occasion when the Minister had to fight her corner in Cabinet, when she had to stand up to the Harney-McCreevy axis and argue the case for public enterprise, she failed. She has turned her back on public enterprise; she runs away from the crunch issues in her Department and escapes out the door with a perfectly crafted script to deliver in her favourite role as the mother goddess of e-commerce, when we all know that she could not tell one if a computer is run on gas or electricity.</P>
    <P>Where is the integrated ticketing system for public transport? The report has been on the Minister's desk for three years and nothing has happened. What has the Minister done to ensure the continuity of electricity supplies? The answer is zilch, nothing. In a desperate bid to avert blackouts in the winter of 2000-01 the ESB had to lease emergency generators at a cost of £60 million. The Minister has tied the hands of the ESB and carried out a vindictive and damaging campaign against it. Her departure would be the best news the company could receive.</P>
    <P>The Minister's pre-occupation with privatisation has placed a cloud over the whole semi-State sector. Confidence among workers and management has been systematically eroded since she has taken office. The crises that have occurred in the management and board rooms of Aer Lingus, CIÉ and Telecom Éireann when in public ownership are just the most visible examples of the damage that the Minister has caused throughout the public sector.</P>
    <P>Under the guise of an IPO, a trade sale or strategic alliance, or whatever other gem her spin-doctors can come up with, the Minister's real strategy for the public sector is the same. It is to sell off as much as possible as quickly as possible. She is the only Minister in the history of the State who is actively working to achieve the demise of her own Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister's repeated utterances in this Chamber about her concern and admiration for the workers in the semi-State sector are nothing more than weasel words. She is intent on selling down the river as many jobs as possible in the sector. She has no understanding of it because she has no understanding of the concept of universal service. Universal service is a basic, democratic and social doctrine that demands that certain essential services are delivered to citizens across <Col N="947" /> the State at a common price as of right. Our semi-State sector has delivered universal service to our citizens. However, urged on by the privatisation buccaneers who hold office in the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister is determined to sacrifice this principle on the altar of the free market and competition. Access to high quality services such as electricity, telephone communications and transport will increasingly become dependent on one's ability to pay. What the Government has done to the health service will be replicated across the electricity, transport and telecommunications sectors. The social apartheid created by our two tier health system will be copperfastened by a two tier transport system, a two tier electricity network and a two tier telecommunications market. The only guiding principle in this regime will be the ability to pay a big fat cheque for access to the services.</P>
    <P>The Minister's time in office has been a nightmare for the semi-State sector. Every company in which the Government retains a shareholding on behalf of the citizens of this country is being lined up for privatisation. It is impossible for workers or management in these companies to plan for the future or meet the new market challenges as long as this ever present threat hangs over their heads.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister issued an invitation to debate the issues. I will warmly accept her challenge. I notice she is not in the House to take part in the debate. Her keenness for public debate has not been a feature of her tenure in office. She seems to have negotiated a contract with &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that guarantees her an uninterrupted slot every time she appears. Her conversion to public debate is welcome and I look forward to exposing her inertia, incompetence and inability to the citizens of this country. It is time for her to go. Last night she demonstrated that while she may still be able to compete with the Minister of State, Deputy Willie O'Dea, for the title of clown of the Oireachtas, she has no vision or plan for public enterprise in this country. Her record shows that she is opposed to the concept of public enterprise. It is time that she went.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Roche and Noel Ahern. I strongly oppose the motion tabled by members of the Opposition. It gives a completely wrong impression of Government policy across a range of public service sectors. Nobody would deny that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has an extremely challenging job. She has wide-ranging responsibilities across a range of semi-State companies, which include Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, Bord Gáis and the ESB to name a few. Many new directives and regulations are being implemented within the European Union which seek to deregulate the operation of some of those companies. The Minister also has <Col N="948" /> responsibility for the transport sector, which covers the operations of bus, rail, and air services.</P>
      <P>The motion states that the Government has not made a convincing argument about the short-term nature of Aer Lingus' difficulties. That is nonsense. No economic sector in the world is immune from the repercussions of what happened in America on 11 September. Many businesses will have to change the manner in which they carry out their operations in order to survive in what is now a new economic climate. We all must face up to these new realities.</P>
      <P>The area most greatly affected as an immediate consequence of the recent terrorist attacks is the aviation industry. I do not think there is one person in Ireland who does not know that Aer Lingus has financial difficulties. One need only look to the statistics presented to us on the losses in revenue by Aer Lingus in recent weeks. The reductions in the number of people travelling on transatlantic flights have greatly reduced as a result of the terrorist attacks in America. Aer Lingus accounts for 70% of the direct traffic between Ireland and America. Ireland ranks seventh among the 15 EU member states in passenger numbers carried on an annual basis on direct flights to the United States. Transatlantic routes account for up to 60% of the profits of Aer Lingus. Transatlantic routes are crucial in attracting US tourists and in facilitating business and cargo traffic. In tourism terms, our dependence on the US market is on average three or four times greater than the other member states of the European Union. This is matched only by a similar level of dependence in Britain.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government are committed to the task of securing the future of Aer Lingus and with it protecting as many sustainable jobs as possible. The Government has decided in principle that the survival plan for Aer Lingus should be rapidly agreed and implemented in all its aspects. That would facilitate private sector interests in investing in Aer Lingus in order to provide a source of funding to support the survival plan.</P>
      <P>The Minister has met the central representative committee of Aer Lingus unions on a number of occasions recently and the Taoiseach and the Minister have met representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The Government wants to protect Aer Lingus and to ensure that it is a viable entity for many years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the recent statement by the Minister that it is very important that there is a viable future for Shannon Airport. It is Government policy that Aer Lingus and Shannon Airport survive as viable entities because of the important economic roles they played in our economy. More than two million passengers use Shannon Airport. The development of that airport is important not only in terms of protecting many jobs which are dependent on the airport's continued viability but also in terms of the importance of Shannon airport in attracting new tourists to the mid west region. Put in the simplest terms, <Col N="949" /> Shannon Airport is the cog which develops the wheel of tourism in that region. The Government is extremely active in ensuring that Shannon Airport has a future, that jobs there are protected and that the mid western region continues to grow and prosper.</P>
    <P>There is an inextricable link between the need to protect the viability of Aer Lingus and the need to protect the viability of Shannon Airport. The Minister shares this view and is extremely active on this issue. We should not forget that direct transatlantic links contribute tremendously to the development of manufacturing and the services industries in the mid west region. Direct links are important in terms of the transportation of cargo. This is particularly the case for the hi-tech sector industries.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has successfully secured access to land in many key airports in the United States of America in recent years. Due to the terrorist attacks, Aer Lingus has had to withdraw from operating some Irish-American routes in recent weeks. It is important that Aer Lingus maintains the right to reopen these routes as greater consumer confidence is secured in travel in general and transatlantic travel in particular.</P>
    <P>To try to pretend, as the Opposition seeks to, that the Government is not investing in the aviation sector is inaccurate. The facts speak for themselves. There has been a capital investment of more than £0.25 billion by Aer Rianta in State airports between 1997 and 2000. It is anticipated that Aer Rianta will spend £100 million in the 2001 on State airports alone. The Opposition seeks to convey the impression that the Government is not committed to all regions, but that is also false. In the aviation sector alone, almost £20 million has been allocated to support regional airports and regional air services since 1997 by means of capital grants and marketing support. The Minister has been particularly innovative in this regard.</P>
    <P>An Independent Commission for Aviation Regulation has been established. Passenger numbers for Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports have increased from 13 million in 1997 to more than 18 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>For every single pound that the Fine Gael-Labour Government invested in public transport in 1995 and 1996, this Government has invested £100,000. I want to set the record straight. During the period of the last Administration the total Exchequer capital investment in public funding in the last two years it was in power was a miserly £400,000. That sum would not buy a single bendy bus and it is £100,000 short of cost of buying two double decker buses. When it comes to politics, it seems that if there was an olympic gold medal for brass neck politics, the former Administration would have it in perpetuity. The Government has made the biggest single investment in public transport by any Government in the history of the State.</P>

      <P>It probably invested £400,000 in that too. By 1999, the Government had invested £132.4 million. That figure rises to £271.5 million this year. I put these figures on the record not to suggest that they are enough but to show that historically there has been a catastrophic failure <Col N="951" /> by all Governments to invest in public transport. However, a Government that invested £400,000 in a full financial year has a brass neck to criticise a Government that has increased that investment by several thousand per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be said that previous Governments also had dismal records. Since 1997 the Government has funded the extension of the DART to Greystones and Malahide and has provided funding for track and ancillary signalling works, some of which is necessitated by decisions which were endorsed by Fine Gael Members when they were in government and held the transport portfolio. Last year the Government invested more in a park and ride facility in Greystones than the Government of which Fine Gael was a part invested in the entire public transport sector. A total of £800,000 was invested in one public park and ride facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in Greystones. I can show it on the map to the Deputy. Greystones should be well known to Fine Gael Members because in 1995, ten days before the by-election in Wicklow, the then Government hoisted a broken down DART train onto the back of a flatbed truck and brought it to the town to announce it intended to extend the DART to Greystones. Even though the then Minister was good with finances, he forgot to provide money for the extension. That was done by this Government.</P>
      <P>Public transport has received catastrophic under-investment by all Governments of the State, and the type of debate we are having now will not improve matters. The Opposition Deputies rightly ask if the service is any better. There are still major problems to be addressed but they will not be addressed by the type of mendacious politics in which we are engaging. They will be addressed if Oireachtas Members, parties and committees address the issue of catastrophic failure to deliver. A service that is getting more than £270 million this year, as opposed to £400,000 five years ago, should be infinitely better. However, it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we are saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. There are deficiencies in the service because there has been a history of under-investment. Look at the extension of the DART which was promised when the Fine Gael Party was in Government but for which it provided no funds. The extension has been achieved. It is interesting to note that the DART was operating up to last year with the same rolling stock that was bought in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been catastrophic under-investment in public transport throughout the history of the State. The Minister stands head and shoulders <Col N="952" /> above any other Minister in that she is at least making the effort. She is not talking about it but doing it. That is probably unpalatable for the Opposition parties but they should at least have the political honesty to recognise what is being done.</P>

      <P>Too many people think life is like turning on the television &ndash; just zap the remote control and things happen. It is not like that when one is discussing provision of infrastructure for transport. There is no magic wand a Minister or Government can wave to suddenly make things right.</P>
      <P>I agree with the last speaker that all Governments are responsible for the problem. For too long we have not invested in public transport. We were always just getting by and, as Deputy Higgins said, it worked. It is like the end of the tube of toothpaste, one can get by for a while getting the last little squeeze out of it but sooner or later it dries up. That is what has happened with public transport in recent years. All Governments over the years tweaked it one way or the other, trying to make do with what they had without putting serious investment into it.</P>
      <P>In the past five years the penny dropped. Deputy Roche outlined the current investment. Last year it was £200 million and this year it will be £270 million whereas in 1996 and 1997 it was £6 million or £7 million per year. The investment in public transport provision at present is enormous. Of course, it should have happened years ago and it is a pity it did not. What we must do now, particularly if the economy is going off the boil, is guarantee that the last place we will start making expenditure cuts is on public transport. Now that we are geared to investing in transport infrastructure, we should maintain it, regardless of whether growth in the country is at 10% or 1%. That is the commitment we must make.</P>
      <P>There is enormous investment in Dublin, such as in the M50 and the Dublin Port tunnel. Work on the tunnel started recently in my area. It will require enormous investment and in the short-term will cause headaches and heartaches. However, these developments are marvellous and will be beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Blaming the Minister for everything that has gone wrong is crazy. I regularly see this type of thing on Dublin City Council. Many of the Members on the Opposition benches talk a great deal about the need to do various things but when the council tries to provide a quality bus corridor or some other development, they support the <Col N="953" /> local person or shopkeeper who objects to the QBC outside their premises. I am not saying we should steamroll over local opinion but we cannot be dominated by it. Members cannot come to the House and talk in macro terms while outside the House ally themselves with everybody who has a minor concern. It is a case of either looking at individual needs or at what is for the common good.</P>
    <P>These people are not all on the Opposition benches. Some are in my party and one wonders if they will ever make up their minds about where they stand.</P>

      <P>I am not fingering the Deputy. Aer Lingus is another important issue. There are problems but I hope the staff will sort them out. I worked at the airport for about seven years. Aer Lingus and air travel generally has had its ups and downs. Let us hope the company will get its business together again. Most of the serious talking must be done at the airport. I do not enjoy seeing anybody forced out of their job. I hope negotiations take place at local level, that is where they must happen.</P>
      <P>I was a semi-State employee for many years. Semi-State workers tended to compare themselves with other semi-State employees, whether it was the ESB, CIÉ, Aer Lingus or whatever, and assumed that wages, conditions and retirement provisions were much the same across the sector. I hope the people who will have to leave Aer Lingus can negotiate terms that are similar to those that workers in other such organisations would get.</P>
      <P>Enormous change is taking place in the public sector. Many structural and regulatory changes as well as EU directives are being implemented under the Minister. She has moved much of that work forward. Life is changing and there have been many changes in the semi-State companies under her Department. Simply standing back and indulging in a mad slag is crazy. This motion is off the wall.</P>

      <P>I will take this opportunity to repeat some of my remarks this morning when I complimented the Minister, during my contribution on the railway infrastructure Bill, on the announcements she made recently. There is an improved train service from Galway to Dublin. There are extra trains in the morning from Galway to Dublin and in the evening from Dublin to Galway. Great credit should be given to the <Col N="954" /> Minister for that. Thanks to Bus Éireann there are buses running on the hour from west to east and from east to west. That is a welcome development. We were not used to such service.</P>
      <P>I noticed that no reference was made to An Post when the Opposition was listing the failures of the Minister for Public Enterprise. I assume that the fact that it is not mentioned in the motion means that the Opposition is happy that the Minister is trying to protect the post office network.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Most rural Deputies know that the post office, like the local school and the local church, has a unique position in the community. I notice that the Minister recently said she would like to see more business for the post office network and announced that ESB bills can be paid at post offices from next year, which is a welcome development. One of the recommendations of the Flynn report is that all necessary steps be taken by Government to maximise the amount of business channelled to the An Post network. It is a good and positive recommendation. Another suggestion was that the provision of a community based Internet access point be examined, with the capacity of the sub-post office network to offer banking facilities. I know many Deputies have spoken about this issue and proposed that banking facilities be made available when banks have pulled out of smaller towns and villages.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been very positive regarding the minor issues that worry people. There was a furore recently when Eircom began to remove pay phones from smaller towns and villages, an issue that Deputies from western areas, including Galway, raised with the Minister. As a result of her intervention, Eircom gave a commitment not to remove any pay phone kiosks from areas that have only one kiosk. She deserves credit for this achievement.</P>
      <P>Many of the failures listed in the motion do not exist. In relation to ESB power generation, the Minister and the ESB announced the upgrading of the line between Portumna and Athenry, which will be of great benefit to commercial and domestic consumers. The Minister has responded to the need to improve the electricity grid along the western seaboard, from County Donegal to County Kerry. She is aware that there is no point in designating the BMW region as having priority status if there is an inadequate electricity supply. Proper regional development includes improvements in the provision of electricity in the regions.</P>
      <P>Galway Chamber of Commerce has welcomed the Minister's continued funding for Galway Airport and other smaller airports. The grants allocated for marketing have been very welcome. I hope they will continue. I am glad the Minister has shown a commitment to Shannon Airport, the main airport for the western seaboard and the mid-west. There is great potential for extra business in Shannon.</P>

Fianna Fáil will be given a mandate to continue its work in running and leading the country.

A new hotel has been built on the grounds of Cork Airport and I challenge the Opposition to stay in it and spend some money in Cork. A new urban rail service between Cork and Mallow has been proposed, with stops at Kilbarry, Rathpeacon, Blarney, Rathduff and Mallow. The service will greatly enhance public service in the Cork region. A strategic plan for the Cork area has been endorsed by Cork Corporation and Cork County Council. It is hoped the line between Cork and Midleton will reopen in the future. The Arrow rail service between Cork and Cobh is very successful. How much time do I have to give some more figures?</P>

      <P>I wish to give some idea of the investment made. In 1997, £6.5 million was invested in public transport, a figure which rose to £7.82 million in 1998, £132 million in 1999, £199 million in 2000 and £271 million in 2001. Subventions to CIE grew from £105 million in 1997 to £159 million in 2001. When I came to this House in 1997 the buses on the streets of Cork were between 11 and 14 years old and choking the streets with carbon monoxide. They were not fit for people to sit in because of their age, but that is no longer the case. There are 80 new buses on the streets of Cork and 12 more will come on stream this year, as a result of the Government. I thank the Minister for Public Enterprise, as I have done on many occasions during the last four and a half years in this Chamber when the Opposition has challenged her during Private Members' Business. I recognise the work she has done.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann received delivery of 148 new buses in 2000, of which 59 were additional and 89 were replacements. Forty of these buses were deployed in the greater Dublin area. In 2001, 70 new buses will be delivered, 34 to Dublin and 36 to provincial cities &ndash; 20 to Cork, six to Limerick and five each to Galway and Waterford. I thought Cork was to receive 12 buses, but I realise that the correct figure is 20.</P>

      <P>Moving on to rail safety, a new plan from 1999 to 2003 has been put in place following an independent review commissioned by the Minister for Public Enterprise. This involves a total investment of £430 million over five years, of which £350 million will be spent in the next two years. The money will be used to tackle both infrastructural and management aspects of rail safety. Deputy Jim Higgins and I are experts in rail safety and other matters relating to rail services. It is interesting to note the statistics, for example, that 89 miles of track was renewed in 1999, 84 miles in 2000 while 56 miles have been renewed this year, up to September. There has, therefore, been a total of 229 miles of track improvement, leading to greater rail safety, in the last three years. Expenditure on this programme amounted to £71 million in 1999, £100 million in 2000 and £114 million this year. I will return to the House at 8.30 p.m. to vote for a Minister who has served public enterprise well during the last four and a half years.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Flanagan, Cosgrave, Kenny, Seán Ryan and Joe Higgins.</P>
      <P>I wish to support the motion for a number of reasons other than those outlined so far.</P>
      <P>These reasons include the failure of the Minister to do anything positive about the new rail line to Navan, the hardship caused to individuals who apply to the ESB for a connection, the discontinuance last week of the freight train from Kingscourt to Navan and Drogheda and the Eircom flotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister used clichés and levelled insults at Members on this side of the House during her performance last night. We must look at her record, at what she has achieved and at what she is known as in many sections of the public sector. She is known as &ldquo;mammy&rdquo; by the many people she meets. She tries to dictate the pace on the basis that she knows everything. We have only to look at the large number of resignations by chairmen and chief executive officers because they failed to convince her of the right way to do business. I give some credit to the former Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Albert Reynolds, because when he was elected Taoiseach a number of years ago he made a firm decision on his first day in office to sack the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke. He must have known something which has taken us and everyone in the country four years to find out, namely, that one cannot put a square peg in a round hole. The Minister has made more enemies than friends over the past three or four years. She criticised appointments made in this House, but she should outline to this House or to the public her role in <Col N="958" /> the appointments she made to Westmeath VEC with her casting vote, which lost £1 million of taxpayers' money in investments abroad. It is only right and proper that she should explain her role in that.</P>
    <P>The population of County Meath has grown since 1996 from 109,000 to 132,000. There has been a large increase in the number of young people buying houses in the only county in which they can afford them. Many of them expected a new rail track to be laid between Navan and Dublin. Funding is not provided in the national development plan for such a rail line. I condemn the Minister for her inaction in this area. She has failed the people of my constituency.</P>
    <P>If people in County Meath apply to the ESB for a connection or to upgrade the electricity service for business purposes, there is a 12 to 16 week delay. However, the people in the ESB have said that if a person wants to pay the staff for the overtime on a Saturday and Sunday, he or she will have the service within three to four weeks. That is a two tier ESB service, like the two tier health service which the Government has allowed to develop over the past four and a half years.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister allowed the biggest single freight line in Ireland to close because she was not prepared to subsidise the freight being carried on the line from Kingscourt to Navan and from Navan to Drogheda. This means there will be 20 more trucks with 30 tonnes of weight on the roads every day. However, funding has not been provided to develop the road network in that area. That is another failure in County Meath. One week ago the Minister failed to keep a line open which had been open for 106 years.</P>
    <P>Some 500,000 people lost thousands of pounds when Eircom was floated. They were misled and misinformed by the Minister and the Minister for Finance. I suspect those people will not forget the Minister for Public Enterprise on election day. Some 2,500 people will lose their jobs in Aer Lingus. Everyone tries to suggest that the attacks on 11 September were the cause of the problems in Aer Lingus. How long is it since there were problems in Aer Lingus? How long is it since the Minister failed to take any action to save those jobs? She failed dismally and many people in my constituency and across north Dublin will be out of work as a result of her failure to act fast enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have four brief points in support of the motion tabled by Deputy Jim Higgins and supported by other Opposition parties. As regards Eircom, after the Minister was appointed, she put her own man, Mr. Ray MacSharry, a former Member of this House, in charge of it. Both she and Mr. MacSharry promised the sun, moon and stars to the investors, the public. She promised a bright and dynamic future for Eircom. However, within two years the company was sold at a knockdown price to Sir Anthony O'Reilly and a group of unknown foreign business <Col N="959" /> interests. Up to 500,000 Irish shareholders were sold a pup and the person responsible is the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob's boss, Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
      <P>As regards Luas, this debacle is well summed up by the phantom rail track outside the Department of the Taoiseach last weekend. This was added to only in terms of neck by the Minister's trip to London last year to be photographed beside another portion of rail track and a tramcar at a cost to the taxpayer of a sum in excess of £25,000. Yet while these photo opportunities are taking place, we are told it will be at least a further two and a half years before anybody travels on Luas in this city of gridlock.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that Iarnród Éireann is proceeding to dismantle the freight service throughout the country under the eyes of the Minister and the Minister of State. This is astonishing given that there is daily gridlock not only in this city but on our major road arteries. The Minister seems totally oblivious that it will cause more freight traffic to be moved from rail to road rather than the other way around. The Minister has not taken any action. The situation in Iarnród Éireann is exemplified by the fact that diesel locomotives in Sligo and other stations around the country are not turned off. They remain in a starter position with the engine purring for days and weeks. This wastes fuel and causes noise and disturbance. If this happened in Thomas The Tank Engine, children would not believe it. Yet the Minister and the Minister of State stand by and allow Iarnród Éireann to be mismanaged in this manner. I challenge the Minister and the Minister of State to refer me to one satisfied customer in the State. Is there a passenger or a commuter in the State who can say they are consistently happy with the rail service? The Minister and the Minister of State are not able to refer me to one such customer.</P>
      <P>As regards the ESB, job development will not be sufficient in the regions unless and until the ESB is in a position to provide sufficient power for the west, north west and other regions. This has been known for years, yet the Minister, who represents a constituency in the Border, midlands and western region which is adjacent to my constituency, consistently refuses to take action to improve the situation. Meanwhile, Rhode power station in my constituency and on the borders of Offaly and Westmeath, which is the last remaining ESB power generating station in the midlands, has been closed for months because of a burst pipe. The 101 people who are engaged in the process of generating electricity cannot do so because the station is closed. Yet industrialists and enterprise experts tell us that the west, the north west and part of the north midlands are no go areas for industrial development because there is not sufficient power. The Minister and the Government are not working. They have squandered our boom in four and a half wasted years in office and it is time for them to go.</P>

      <P>It was a sorry day that this House saw the appointment of Deputy O'Rourke as Minister for Public Enterprise. Since that day we have not witnessed her managing the ministerial brief. We have been treated to a performance of nothingness. As a result, the infrastructure of the State is not servicing consumer demand as it should be. These failures of this Minister will increase the negative effect of the current world economic downturn. Investors work out whether the countries in which they are prepared to invest have the capability to meet their demands for power and communications now and in the years ahead and deliver services when and where they are required at a competitive price in the world market. By not having the structures in place to adequately regulate these markets, the Minister has failed to give long-term assurance to employment creators that these basic services will be available at a competitive price at the level and scale they may require.</P>
      <P>Her regime has not encouraged a spirit of true entrepreneurial culture among the Irish people or the management of the ESB. The board spent £3 million on preliminary preparation to bid for power supply companies in Poland but our great Minister does not have the energetic drive to permit the bid to progress. She also badly mishandled the privatisation of Eircom as a result of which 500,000 ordinary investors were stung. The Minister and the Cabinet delivered a bad sting to these investors, many of whom had borrowed to invest in Mary's sure fire bet. The experience of these many first time investors will cause long-term negative reaction to stock market investment. These are some highlights of Deputy O'Rourke's record of failure. If she were a car, she would fail her NCT.</P>
      <P>I turn to the scandal of the lack of development of public transport nationally and in our cities in particular. Traffic congestion increases daily resulting in adverse affects on the nation's health and the environment. Ireland has significant unnecessary levels of exhaust emissions and fuel consumption. Those who commute by car are trapped in tin boxes and spend most of their time at a standstill in traffic jams. They fume as their blood pressure increases. The Minister for Public Enterprise is responsible for this mess. Had she used the Government's past four years in power to put an adequate number of buses on the road, bring forward the Luas project while ensuring capacity in our rail network was confronted and funded, this terrible traffic chaos would not exist. The Minister presided over inaction. It is as if she believes if one does nothing, one does nothing wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers are in office to guide and direct. The Aer Lingus disaster will always be to the Minister's shame. A total of 2,026 posts are to be sacrificed because she was not up to the job. FLS Aerospace located at Dublin Airport announced earlier it is to let go another 200 staff. This would not have happened if the Minister listened to the company's employees. They campaigned to have <Col N="961" /> the Sikorsky helicopter contract placed with the company. The Minister for Defence should be approached by the Minister for Public Enterprise and requested to award the contract to FLS. It would save these jobs and would ensure the European maintenance contract for the company and create more jobs. Pure neglect has led to a failure to ask the Taoiseach to approach the Minister for Defence to award this contract to FLS, thus ensuring the jobs would be saved and more created.</P>
    <P>Everywhere the Minister turns, her failures are there to haunt her. Unfortunately for those who will lose their jobs at Aer Lingus and FLS she has done nothing to ease the pain. What has she done to protect the great national flag carrier? Once a symbol of the nation, Aer Lingus is faced with scratching about to sell off its assets while the Minister looks on. One hundred and fifty years ago the people were sacrificed by a Government which did not care and members of that Government who cared were too inept to intervene to save the situation. Our Government has proved not to be better than that foreign one.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach realised the Minister for Public Enterprise was not up to the job of ensuring firm foundations for the long-term viability of the national airline did he reshuffle his Cabinet and appoint a positive fresh force to replace this tired and fading Minister?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The portfolio given to the Minister for Public Enterprise by the Taoiseach is the problem because anyone who is appointed to a ministry is faced with an avalanche of personnel and material on his or her first day in office, as members of the Labour Party will be aware. The <Col N="962" /> brief of the Minister and the Department is too wide to be managed effectively. Spreading one's energies over too large an area results in inconsistency, incompetence and mismanagement. All the areas under Deputy O'Rourke's guidance are minefields and have been for many years.</P>
    <P>The moneys to drive the national development plan have only been provided over the past five years and, therefore, there is no point in comparing what was spent between 1991 and 1996 with what has been spent since then because different sets of values and income limits apply. The Minister for Public Enterprise has dismally failed to live up to implementing any one of a number of clear priorities. When Deputy John Bruton became Taoiseach he gave us many good pieces of advice but one stuck with me. He told us to focus on a number of small priorities and pursue them, otherwise we would get buried in the trenches of the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise or anyone supporting her cannot come into the House and say she is a shining example of good political management of a Department covering various aspects of public transport that Europe can follow. Those of us who live along the western rail line have been told money is running out to finish the line between Munulla and Westport and Ballina. Gas, which has been lying under the Atlantic for millions of years, was found off the west coast and Belmullet, the closest town on land, was bypassed when it was brought ashore. People have been forced to emigrate from the area for generations under all Governments. Many of them have worked on gas pipelines throughout the world but I bet towns in the midlands will be provided with gas spurs.</P>
    <P>The Government is tired, jaded, fatigued and is suffering from incompetence and mismanagement. The Government train will reach a political station before next May and it will be sent screaming into political oblivion because this train, if no other, is surely headed for the buffers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I had reason to outline the litany of job losses, totalling 6,000, that have gripped the north Dublin region over the past 12 months. This is the equivalent of the population of many large towns in Ireland. This is the extent of the misery and hardship handed out to the workers and their families in the region.</P>
      <P>Little did I realise that today I would be able to add another 150 job losses which will take place between November and next March due to the restructuring plan at FLS. I am concerned that this announcement is the tip of the iceberg for this company which employs 1,500 skilled workers. I am concerned for the future employment prospects, given that the parent company has stated there will be no further investment and that FLS will have to paddle its own canoe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of this development I am more convinced than ever that the proposed purchase by the Government of helicopters for the Air Corps <Col N="963" /> provides a unique opportunity for FLS to diversify its core business on the basis of a successful bid by Sikorsky, including a number of offset deals, thus preserving jobs, particularly in the summer. The Government's line to date has been that job losses have been outside its control, but the helicopter contract provides it with a prime opportunity to show its support for employment in north Dublin.</P>
    <P>The viability plan drawn up by Aer Lingus envisages funding for voluntary redundancies and investment of £50 million. However, the State which owns 90% of the shares in the company has come up with nothing. This is scandalous. The Government has hidden behind the Commission's guidelines because it suited its policy. Having received professional advice, I am of the opinion that, if the will existed, the State could argue it is acting as a market economy investor and invest funds in Aer Lingus for which it can expect a reasonable return. It is arguable that such an approach would not fall foul of the state aid provisions. As this matter is in the public domain and in the light of its guidelines on state aid, the Commission may seek to challenge the State's right to make such an investment. However, the contemporaneous investment on similar terms by a private investor bolsters the State's position and assists any defence it may offer in the event of a court case.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that negotiations have commenced between the trade unions and the company. However, two important components for a successful outcome are missing, namely, a commitment by the State to invest in the company and to ensure there are no involuntary redundancies. It is not too late for the Government to take the gloves off as far as Brussels is concerned and secure the future of Aer Lingus. However, given the Minister's comments in the House, I fear that the Government has sold out Aer Lingus &ndash; our national airline &ndash; and its workforce.</P>
    <P>The facts are clear. These are exceptional times in the aviation industry. The Government can invest in Aer Lingus under the market investor principle if it so chooses. If the Government does not act now, it could be responsible for the demise of Aer Lingus. It would also be responsible for the consequences of such a development for people, the economy and the workforce who in recent years built up the company. The facts show how successful they have been prior to 11 September.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed Aer Lingus and the workers in the region. It would be preferable if the Minister resigned in order that the so-called &ldquo;northside Taoiseach&rdquo; could do a proper job for the people of the region.</P>

        <b>: </b>The motion before the House calls on the Minister for Public Enterprise to be removed from office. I agree with the proposal, but not because there is a <Col N="964" /> qualitative difference in performance or ideology between the Minister and the Government &ndash; the Government should go the same way as the Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke is conferred with the title of Minister for Public Enterprise. However, there has been no more misconstrued or misnamed Minister in recent times. In the past four and a half years the Minister has been antipathetic to public enterprise. Above all she has been a Minister for privatisation of valuable public services which properly belong to the people and which should be maintained and developed in public ownership for the benefit of their workers and the people. The raft of staggering job losses in multinational corporations announced in recent weeks should give us pause for thought as far as the privatisation bandwagon is concerned. The Government will claim to have little control over multinational corporations. Decisions made in far flung capitals determine the future, or lack of it, of thousands of Irish workers. However, our indigenous publicly-owned companies are being handed over to these multinational organisations to further reduce the control over the numbers of people at work in this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister stands condemned for her management of the difficulties in Aer Lingus alone. It is a travesty that the majority of the board of Aer Lingus, a premier publicly-owned company &ndash; the national airline &ndash; should, at the behest of the Government, be demanding the axing of over 2,000 jobs and refusing to have the State invest in the company it owns. This is being done on the basis of the threadbare excuse that the European Union opposes such investment.</P>
      <P>The atrocities of 11 September have been cynically used time and again to cover a multitude. That is certainly the case as regards Aer Lingus. It is clear that Aer Lingus was going to face difficulties, given the foot and mouth disease crisis earlier this year and the events of 11 September. However, those difficulties are temporary. Last year the company made a profit of £60 million. It could be turned around and put on a firm footing without shedding any jobs, if the will existed. However, far from a will to invest in Aer Lingus, those at the most senior levels of the Department of Public Enterprise wish to privatise the company. It is outrageous that senior civil servants are dictating the State's privatisation programme with a hapless Minister going along helplessly in their wake. This is a dire situation for which Aer Lingus workers and the community in north Dublin will pay a heavy price if the Government is not stopped. Workers made redundant must be guaranteed pension and termination entitlements well above what is being suggested.</P>
      <P>I could go through many other issues in regard to privatisation if I had time. Handing over the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, the only such facility in this State, to a multinational company based in America with disastrous health and safety and environmental records, is also a crime for which this Minister should be dismissed.</P>

Her work rate and her resolve in seeking and securing massive amounts of funding to invest in those sectors will be the legacy she leaves to Ireland. She has laid the foundations for a considerable amount of state of the art infrastructure and time will honour her for that performance.</P>
      <P>I will briefly address the handful of areas under my control. I have had the opportunity to talk about the nuclear and Sellafield issues on three or four occasions since we returned from the summer recess in this and in the other House so I will not repeat myself. I reiterate the Government's dismay and anger at the British Government's decision to give the go ahead to the MOX plant. We have consistently opposed this plant and the British Government is in no doubt as to the depth of opposition in Ireland to it and to the Sellafield operations. There is no country on this planet that is more anti-nuclear than this one, no Government more anti-nuclear than this one and no people more anti-nuclear than the Irish people. That has been conveyed throughout the world in recent years. A solid consensus has been established.</P>
      <P>The Government is determined to prevent the MOX plant from starting. The legal actions upon which we have embarked under the OSPAR convention, on the law of the sea and under European law, if necessary, are an indication of our commitment to this goal. We have exhausted the diplomatic route in stopping the MOX plant and are now pursuing the legal route, a route which no previous Government has ever taken. The legal case being taken is not a reaction to a recent announcement by the British Government with which we do not agree. Preparatory legal and other work done over a long period has left us in a state of preparedness to proceed at the appropriate time with these cases. I know everyone here hopes we are successful in that.</P>
      <P>I am not the adversarial type but I sat here the other night and was lectured by Deputy Howlin who stuck his chest out and told us how much better he managed things, how he managed being a senior Minister and how he did a much better job in the context of the then ministerial committee.

        <b>: </b>This motion was not flippantly conceived. It was not put on the Order Paper out of political opportunism. It is not on the Order Paper to get at the Minister personally. It is on the Order Paper because this country, its economy and its people are, unfortunately, stuck with the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who as Minister for Public Enterprise is pitifully incompetent and incapable of managing the most crucial and pivotal Department in the whole State structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is on the Order Paper because never before has this country been foisted with a Minister, in charge of such a range of vital State utilities and who has failed miserably to meet the challenge or the opportunities of our State company sector and who has been an absolute and total flop. It is on the Order Paper because the Minister is the people's shareholder on each of the centrally important semi-State companies. In each and every case she has let the people down, she has let the country down and she has let the companies down. It is on the Order Paper because the Minister has had four years and four <Col N="967" /> months in office. For four years and four months she has talked the talk, pumping out torrents of meaningless verbiage and balderdash, posing for photographs, engaging in a range of ritual well choreographed public relations stunts but failing hopelessly to manage her Department, its resources or the plethora of companies under her direct command.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has put down this motion because the time has come to call a spade a spade, to call a halt and to end this charade. We have put down this motion because the Department the Minister mismanages and the State enterprises she has neglected and mismanaged are the fulcrum of the economy. As has been said repeatedly by those on this side of the House, this Minister for Public Enterprise must go.</P>
    <P>That the Labour Party and the Green Party have agreed to co-sponsor this motion with Fine Gael speaks for itself. It is an indication of not just political cross-party unity on this issue but of the public realisation of just how seriously the semi-State sector has fallen to shreds under the baton of this Minister.</P>
    <P>The motion focuses on 15 areas of responsibility where the Minister has abjectly failed to measure up. The Minister's disastrous fumbling with the affairs of Aer Lingus not just in the past five weeks but right from the very start of her assuming office has been a glaring example of her indecisiveness and lack of vision. Aer Lingus was in good shape when the rainbow left office. It was making a substantial profit and its future in continued state ownership looked bright. Suddenly came the announcement that the Minister wanted to put the airline up for sale. She published the Aer Lingus Bill and piloted it through the Seanad. She splurged taxpayer's money on needless accountancy services for advice and publicity, including £480,709 to Irish International Group, £66,360 to Drury Communications, £62,500 to William Fry Solicitors, £50,000 to Mason Hayes and Curran for more legal advice and as yet unspecified amounts to Schroder Solomon Smith Barney and AIB Capital Markets, to Computer Shares, to Deloitte &amp; Touche and to the Merrill Corporation.</P>
    <P>Suddenly the IPO was grounded and we awoke early last summer to the news that the Minister had changed her mind. The IPO was being abandoned and the Minister was going to flog the national airline on the open market by way of a trade sale. She is playing with the fortunes of our proud national carrier as if it were a rag doll at a jumble sale.</P>
    <P>In the past five weeks, the Minister changed tack once again. The airline's work force is now to be cut by 35% &ndash; 2,026 workers are to be made redundant. A derisory redundancy package of four weeks pay for each year of service has been put on offer. The offer to the workers is theoretically voluntary. However, if they do not accept the deal by 30 November, the redundancies will be forced on them. The trade unions rightly believe that they will not accept it. It will then be gun-to-the-head stuff.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken a completely over-<Col N="968" /> the-top approach to the issue. One has to demand an answer to the obvious question as to how our national airline which was making a group profit of £60 million two years ago is now being publicly butchered and humiliated. Is it not patently obvious that the Aer Lingus difficulties are solvable? Aviation, by its very nature, is cyclical and volatile. It is subject to market swings and economic fluctuations. In the case of Aer Lingus, it has been hit by two successive body blows in quick succession &ndash; the foot and mouth crisis earlier this year which devastated the 1.5 million passenger North American market and the 11 September catastrophe. However, people will have to fly again and they will when confidence returns. Aviation will take off again, but the Government seems hell bent on ensuring that when this happens Aer Lingus will only be a debilitated shadow of its former self.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to exploit the exceptional circumstances provisions of the EU directive leads one to believe that the 11 September tragedy is a convenient smokescreen for a covert Government strategy already in place to get rid of our national airline. The people have a special affinity and affection for Aer Lingus. They regard it as part of what we are. There will be a dear political price to be paid by the Government for what it has done or is intent on doing to a very successful national institution.</P>
    <P>Apart from the IPO of Aer Lingus being unnecessary and undesirable, it is also tantamount to selling the national silver. It was never on. The prospect of another IPO, in this case of the national airline, has been irreparably damaged by the debacle of the Eircom flotation. As has been said time and again in this House, the Minister is personally culpable for the Eircom shambles. When one looks at the fees paid for consultancy and legal advice, for a fiasco that left so many investors financially bruised and wounded, one has to ask how such a manifestly incompetent and incapable Minister was ever appointed to such a key ministry. Consultancy money &ndash; taxpayer's money &ndash; was thrown around like confetti. Some £58.42 million went to Merill Lynch International and AIB Capital Markets. This joint venture by the two companies is described in grandiose terms as the &ldquo;Roadshow Co-Ordinator&rdquo;&ndash; some sorry roadshow.</P>

        <b>: </b>Skadden Arps Slate Meagher and Flom was paid £1.25 million to provide international counsel for the Minister &ndash;  some counsel. Irish International Group was in charge of advertising and paid a staggering £3.214 million for its efforts. A further £2.843 million was paid to Citigate Dewe Rogerson for marketing and market research. The receiving agent for the IPO was Computershare Services which was paid £1.408 million for its troubles. Browne Internet was the secure printer and was paid £2.773 million. An Post was paid £3.052 million while PWC was paid £157,000. It cost £74,000 for the registration of clients. A variety of other costs <Col N="969" /> brought the total cost to the taxpayer for the Eircom flotation to a whopping £73.82 million. For what? </P>
      <P>After all the glamour, extravagant advice, advertising, photo calls and champagne, the promises, hopes and expectations of small first-time investors seduced into believing there was a crock of gold at the end of the Minister's rainbow, some 500,000 mainly small investors have been left with holes burned in their pockets having seen their hard-earned money squandered. They feel robbed, duped and are angry. They may have gone quiet for the moment, but they are waiting in the long grass for the Minister and her colleagues and will have their revenge when the election is called. To revert again to the Aer Lingus IPO, or any IPO, who in their right mind would buy even a ten pence share from any enterprise promoted by the Minister for Public Enterprise?</P>
      <P>When the Minister was appointed on 26 June 1997, the Luas light rail project was planned and the finance secure from Europe and the Exchequer. It was ready to roll. Not content to inherit a sound scheme from the rainbow Government, the Minister went back to the drawing board, took out a crayon and started the whole process all over again. Today, in November 2001, all we have is a few dug-up streets, lots of cynical, reassuring expensive front page advertising telling us that Luas is just around the corner, or the ridiculous weekend stunt with the leather-clad Minister prancing around like an Athlone version of Tina Turner.</P>
      <P>The Government states that Luas will be completed in 2003. It might well be constructed by 2003, but between testing, which will take 18 months, and commissioning, which will take another six months, it will be at least 2005 before it transports a single passenger. By then, the Minister's colleagues will be perched along the Opposition benches and I hope she herself will be perched high up on the back benches where she can do no further harm.</P>
      <P>All the while, the citizenry of Dublin bring 100,000 new cars onto the streets of Dublin each year, thereby confirming its status as the most traffic-chaotic, disorganised capital city in Europe. The Minister's ineptitude, indecisiveness, failure to plan and act have led to a situation where we have traffic jams where there never were traffic jams before. Last night she trotted out figures for new buses and new DART carriages, but that is cold comfort to the car-trapped population caught every morning and evening in the country's endless queues because she has failed to deliver an efficient and reliable public transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Minister for Public Enterprise was ever endowed with such resources both from State and EU funds in order to modernise our transport infrastructure, yet after four years and four months at the helm we have been left with the most ragged, decrepit and sub-standard rail service in Europe. Some of the trains on our main lines were commissioned as far back as 1965, 36 <Col N="970" /> years ago. Our trains are almost always late and I do not mean by the 15 minutes to which Deputy Sargent referred last night. It takes three years to commission newly-ordered rolling stock. The carriages ordered recently will not find their way onto the rail tracks of the country until 2004 and 2005. In the meantime passengers will be herded like cattle, left standing for long journeys in the aisles and between carriages, paying up to £30 for a seat. Instead of putting resources into a fast-track, reliable and comfortable rail system, shifting huge volumes of people and freight from road to rail, the Minister continues to preside over a company which is about to cut its freight staff from 600 to 300. We have glaring market opportunities, a huge, well-disposed traffic paralysed population, the potential to turn CIÉ and its subsidiary companies from loss-makers to profit-making enterprises and the Minister for Public Enterprise cannot see her way through the fog, showing neither the will nor the vision to make this a reality.</P>
    <P>We have a great propensity in this country for signing up to international protocols while blandly ignoring the obligations which they entail. We signed up to the Kyoto Protocol and agreed to limit greenhouse emissions to 13% above 1990 levels, but what has happened? Instead of a concerted drive to meet this modest target, Ireland's greenhouse emissions are 20% above target and the latest ESRI report projects a rise of 27% by 2010. This is a disgrace for a country which has the greatest potential in terms of wind and wave power in Europe, yet the Minister and her Minister of State content themselves by uttering pious platitudes.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister's defence last night. It was truly pathetic. There was no constructive rebuttal of the points made by the Opposition. Her performance was a kind of poor quality throw-back to &ldquo;Hall's Pictorial Weekly&rdquo; of 30 years ago. It was Ballymagash all over again. One would have expected somewhat better. Unable to fill her 30 minute slot with anything of substance she called in the services of the late Jim Kemmy's Limerick friend &ndash; Mighty Mouse from Limerick himself &ndash; little wee Willie Winkle. Knockabout comedy is all right when one is entertaining constituents in Southill, but this is a different kettle of fish. This is about the incompetence of a Minister who is an unmitigated disaster, does not care or simply does not realise her own inadequacy. Last night I listened to her &ldquo;snap, crackle and pop&rdquo; comment and it certainly confirmed what we all suspected, that the Minister has lost it. Henceforth, she should devote herself to exploiting her kindergarten talents and mentality by writing fairly tales and nursery rhymes. Listening to the Minister's pathetic speech yesterday, I could reach only one conclusion, it is no wonder we are where we are. The Minister simply has to go.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Suckler Cow Premium Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>Without any disrespect to the Minister of State, I am disappointed that the Minister did not see fit to stay for the debate even though he is in the House. This is the second time today he has disappointed me. This afternoon he did not see fit to attend the meeting of the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It appears the Minister is losing interest in these matters. He has certainly taken his eye off the ball on this issue.</P>
      <P>It has just recently emerged that a very funda-</P>
      <P>mental and seriously damaging change has been made to the rules of the suckler cow premium scheme for 2002. Farmers have always accepted the necessity to have replacement heifers in their herd in order to qualify for the premium. The current requirement is that 15% of the herd are replacement heifers. In a herd of 20 suckler cows, for example, one would have to have three replacement heifers for the herd to qualify for the scheme. These replacement heifers must remain in the herd until the end of the retention period. We all understand the reasons for that.</P>
      <P>Until now, it was assumed the replacement heifers could be in-calf heifers and nobody ever asked the time at which the heifers calved. That was the basis upon which the scheme operated and everybody understood it. Now, however, it has emerged that there is a new rule for 2002, under which a replacement heifer will no longer be counted as one of the replacements in the herd if it calves before the end of the retention period. The effect of the rule is much greater than it appears. The requirement to have a 15% replacement rate means that the loss of one replacement removes six cows in the herd from the benefit of the scheme. So now, one heifer calving in the herd before the end of the retention period will disqualify six cows, or in fact to be pedantic about it, 6.6 cows from the benefit of the scheme. That is a major, monstrous and unwarranted change in the conditions of the scheme. The calving pattern of replacement heifers should be decided by the dictates of good herd management and good husbandry and should not be decided by the need for bureaucratic tidiness whether it is in Brussels or in Kildare Street or wherever else it might be. There is no reason in the wide world why there should be any specification as to when a replacement heifer in a suckler herd can or cannot calve. As long as the animal is on her first pregnancy then she should qualify as a replacement heifer irrespective of when she calves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason there is a condition in the scheme that there be replacement heifers in the herd is <Col N="976" /> to make sure the application is for a bona fide ongoing continuing suckler cow operation and is not a scheme that is there for fly-by-nights who buy in cows in order to get the benefit of the premium and sell them on when they have collected and pocketed the premium. The requirement for the replacements &ndash; a very logical one &ndash; is enough in itself to make sure the scheme has the necessary effect. This new rule is a completely unjustifiable and unnecessary twist. I call on the Minister to ensure that the <i>status quo ante </i>is restored and that hard-pressed suckler herd owners will not now be penalised in this major way, losing potentially one-sixth of their income under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív:</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the elements in the reform of the beef regime which was adopted by the Agriculture Council in June was the introduction of a requirement obliging producers with more than 13 cows to submit heifers for at least 15% of their suckler cow claim. The Minister's interpretation of this provision at the time that this amendment was adopted was that producers would be permitted to use in-calf heifers to fill this requirement and he believes he was not alone in that belief. This interpretation was based on the fact that in-calf heifers are permitted in the existing optional 20% heifer facility and there was never any indication from the Commission that this would not be possible under the obligatory minimum 15% requirement. However the Commission has now come forward with a proposal which would require heifers which calved down during the retention period to be replaced by another heifer. This proposal will be voted on at the meeting of the FEOGA committee tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The Minister raised this issue at the meeting of the Agriculture Council last month. He pointed out to Commissioner Fischler that his proposal was inconsistent with his interpretation of the 15% requirement and he asked him instead to implement this provision on the basis of the status of a heifer on the day of application for the premium. He followed this up with further representations to the Commissioner last week. He has asked the Commissioner to take account of these representations in his proposal to the FEOGA committee tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister accepts that the more restrictive interpretation proposed by the Commission will create difficulties for certain pro<Col N="977" /> ducers, particularly those close to the stocking density limit for the extensification premium, he should point out that the minimum 15% requirement applies only to producers with more than 13 suckler cows, which means that two-thirds of Irish producers are exempt from this provision. In addition, the Teagasc annual farm survey shows that the average specialist suckler cow producer in Ireland normally keeps dry heifers over one year old equivalent to at least 17% of their suckler cow numbers. In view of this, the negative impact of the more restrictive Commission interpretation will be substantially reduced in the case of Irish suckler cow producers. Nevertheless, it is clear that he has vigorously pursued this matter and his officials will continue to press the case in the relevant forum. Tá súil agam go soiléiríonn sé sin an scéal don Teachta agus go bhfuil sé muiníneach anois go ndéanfar gach rud is féidir leis an bhfadhb a réiteach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Health and Children to fully investigate the circumstances whereby a consultant psychiatrist was able to successfully perform his duties of employment with the South Eastern Health Board even though he was under suspension from his duties as a GP in the United Kingdom. Dr. John Harding Price was employed in a locum capacity from 17 April 2000, until 5 November 2000, by the South Eastern Health Board. He was employed at Saint Luke's Hospital, Clonmel, and Saint Canice's Hospital, Kilkenny, both of which are psychiatric hospitals. The South Eastern Health Board received three references in respect of this applicant arising from their advertisement. It was not aware of any allegations against this doctor prior to his employment. The Irish Medical Council, which is charged with the responsibility of verifying consultants' fitness to practice, confirmed the registration of the doctor on 13 April 2000, just a few days before he was formally appointed. Dr Price was suspended by the General Medical Council in the United Kingdom a month previously in March 2000. It has been confirmed that the Medical Council was informed of this matter in April 2000, the very month in which it confirmed and verified the fitness of this person to be employed by the South Eastern Health Board. I am informed that Dr. Price was suspended&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the person was suspended by the General Medical Council in the United Kingdom because of claims of alleged sexual abuse. In an era of modern websites and all the modern communications facilities and taking into consideration the movement of health personnel generally between this country and the United Kingdom, it is difficult to understand how this fiasco could have occurred. A series of legal steps were subsequently taken to remove the person from the Irish Medical Register and this was achieved through a High Court order in January 2001.</P>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed to note that the doctor's name was restored to the same medical register by order of another High Court decision on 10 August 2001, even though there is no indication that the person had been investigated in respect of the complaints in the UK and that he was a fit person to practise and verified by the Irish Medical Council.</P>
      <P>I am not so concerned about the legal issues as outlined by Professor Bury of the Irish Medical Council on 1 November 2001. He asserts that the Medical Council has fully and promptly discharged its responsibilities in this case. I agree that it discharged them but at a considerable length of time after this matter had come to its notice originally. I must treat with disdain and call a load of nonsense, the fact that Professor Bury, the president of the Medical Council, did not see fit to apologise for the error that was created. The Irish Medical Council allowed a doctor, while suspended by the General Medical Council in the UK to be employed by the South Eastern Health Board in two hospitals and nobody knew that he was under suspension in a neighbouring jurisdiction. The Minister has indicated that he will examine the circumstances surrounding the recruitment procedures and I welcome that. The Minister has been aware of this case for a number of days. I expect that a considerable number of vulnerable people in our hospitals, particularly the section of society that we are speaking about, the psychiatric patients and their families, will be quite anxious to have this matter cleared up as quickly as possible. I urge the Minister to conduct an investigation as quickly as possible and to publish the findings and ensure that we have proper recruitment procedures in future so that this cannot happen again. We need accountability in this matter, not only from the Department of Health and Children and the health board, but also from the Medical Council. Legality stands in the way of accountability in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to take action as he is a man of action. Speed is of the essence to allay the <Col N="979" /> anxiety and fear of the vulnerable people concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because in order to protect patients and professionals in the health service, there is an urgent need to establish a proper data management body and to review procedures relating to registration and the ongoing upkeep of information in a policing system of this kind. Will the Minister bring together representatives of the Medical Council, the health boards and the Department of Health and Children as a matter of urgency to establish such a system? </P>
      <P>The Harding Price case, which is in the public domain, has underlined serious deficiencies in the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness:</NameTxt>
      <P>This case, which is of national interest at this stage, has underlined serious deficiencies in the system and caused hardship and personal trauma for patients. The record of the case has been outlined publicly. The General Medical Council in the UK suspended this man and the minutes of that suspension and the case leading up to it are in the public domain and make for very sad reading. I am sure those minutes which were available to me would also have been available to the Medical Council had it chosen to pursue the matter further before giving any comment to the South Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>This man was suspended in March 2000 and the Medical Council was informed of that in April 2000. Why was that information not flagged for the South Eastern Health Board before it employed this individual? Why does the remit of the Medical Council not cover knowing how many professionals are in the system and where they are located? What action can the Minister take in this regard?</P>
      <P>The inaction of the South Eastern Health Board has been appalling. The issue was flagged for that board a long time ago because a legal case was pending, but at the same time an effort was made to shroud the issue in a cloak of secrecy, a fortress like mentality. Why can the board or the Department not come clean on this issue, apologise to the patients involved and create a list of those patients who were treated or, it might be more appropriate to say, interviewed by the man concerned? Why is action on this matter not pro-active rather than reactionary by way of public comment on the radio and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The help line offered is a sham. It is not manned by professional counsellors or competent staff. Callers were occasionally answered by a sec<Col N="980" /> retary, programme managers and so on. The line is not confidential. Various callers have said that their caller ID comes up on screen and, therefore, they are easily traceable, particularly those who, in their private capacity, like to keep an eye on the developments within the health sector.</P>
    <P>Why were the references in this case not checked or why are the references of all professionals in this area not checked? The normal practice in the commercial world is to check at least three or four references when employing a person. One would go beyond the first port of call, of being told the person is registered, and check the person's work ethic and ability to respond to patients and work as part of a team in the health services. That was not done. Why was that overlooked? If this had happened in the commercial world, someone would be responsible, someone would have to carry the can and say he or she did not do his or her job. We must reflect on that. We must ensure that what happened in this case does not happen again.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the vulnerable patients involved. One patient aged 46 rang the help line today but did not get any assistance. In spite of the fact that she was treated by this gentleman, was to the fore listening to the public debate on this issue, is vulnerable and suffering from depression, there was no response. When a complaint was made to the board, there was still no response. That procedure is totally unacceptable. I raise my voice on behalf of the vulnerable patients concerned. I ask for a pro-active response to this matter from the Department through the health board first thing tomorrow morning.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising these matters and allowing me the opportunity to clarify the issues.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health and Children, I am committed to ensuring that any health professional providing a service to a member of the public is properly qualified, competent and fit to practice.</P>
      <P>In relation to medical practitioners, Ireland has a strict regulatory regime which is designed to ensure that only competent, properly qualified medical practitioners of good standing can work in the country. No doctor is allowed to practice medicine in Ireland unless he or she is registered on the Register of Medical Practitioners maintained by the Medical Council.</P>
      <P>Under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, the Medical Council is the independent body charged with regulating medical registration. We introduced that legislation to establish independent bodies which are charged with responsibility for these issues. It is important to bear that in mind in our comments on particular cases as they develop.</P>

From time to time we forget we have devolved statutory authority to different bodies to do different things. We tend to try to leave those bodies off the hook and to bring what is at issue back here too quickly.</P>
      <P>The overriding rationale behind the requirements in the Medical Practitioners Act is the protection of the public. Deputy Hogan mentioned all health professionals, I am sure he will pardon me if I mention that in relation to nurses, An Bord Altranais is the statutory regulatory authority for this profession in Ireland. In considering applications for registration from nurses or midwives from abroad, An Bord Altranais, as a matter of standard practice, requires verification of the applicants' professional and training status and their current registration status from the relevant competent authority in their home country or other applicable country. In the case of applicants from non-EU countries, An Bord Altranais requires two professional references and one employer's reference. Best recruitment practices require that these nurses are subject to the same employment and police checks as Irish nurses. This point will be reinforced in new guidelines being finalised by my Department and which will be issued to all health service employers.</P>
      <P>My Department is also currently working on legislative proposals to provide for the introduction of a system of statutory registration for certain health and social care professionals. Those would be the allied health professions including physiotherapists and speech and language therapists.</P>
      <P>The proposed structures for this system of statutory registration will comprise a registration board for each individual profession involved and a registration council for the system overall. The system will share a set of three common statutory committees, which will include a fitness to practice committee. These committees will play a key role in protecting the public by ensuring that a quality service is provided to the public and that all professionals continue to provide a service of the highest standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this system of statutory registration, each registration board will be legally obliged to maintain a register of all persons deemed eligible to practice within the profession. Each board will determine the criteria for registration, including <Col N="982" /> approved qualifications, education, training and practice experience. In addition, each registration board will maintain details of each registered professional's employer, the position held or place of private practice. The board will also record and maintain all post-registration qualifications held by registered members.</P>
    <P>With regard to the case to which Deputies Hogan and McGuinness referred, I made inquiries of the South Eastern Health Board in this regard. The board informed me that it employed the named doctor in a locum capacity from 17 April 2000 until 5 November 2000. He was employed at St. Luke's Psychiatric Hospital, Clonmel, until 31 July 2000 and from 14 August 2000 at St. Canice's Psychiatric Hospital, Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I have also been advised by the South Eastern Health Board that the temporary appointment was made following the board's advertisement of the post and in accordance with the board's normal recruitment procedures. These procedures include an interview process, obtaining written references and confirming the registration status of any doctor who is employed by the South Eastern Health Board whether in a full-time or temporary capacity.</P>
    <P>Any doctor wishing to practise medicine in Ireland must be registered on the Register of Medical Practitioners. During the period of his employment with the South Eastern Health Board, the doctor in question was registered with the Medical Council and a copy of his registration was forwarded to the South Eastern Health board by the Medical Council on 13 April 2000, that is, prior to his taking up duty with the South Eastern Health Board on 17 April. In fairness to the South Eastern Health Board, the person was on the register when it employed him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The doctor's name had effect in the Irish medical register until 29 January 2001, when it was removed following a High Court order obtained by the Medical Council. However, as the result of an appeal, the doctor's name was restored to the medical register by order of the High Court on 10 August 2001. The South Eastern Health Board has confirmed to me that it was not aware of any allegations against this doctor prior to his employment with the board, nor did <Col N="983" /> it receive any complaints about him during the period of his employment with the board.</P>
      <P>The South Eastern Health Board has established a helpline for patients. I will take up the issue raised by Deputy McGuinness with regard to the operation of that helpline. It was established for patients who may have concerns in relation to their contact with this doctor. I have been advised that since the establishment of the helpline, four inquiries have been received by the board. Two of these inquiries are in the nature of complaints and these complaints are being urgently investigated by the board.</P>
      <P>As the board is also conscious that some people may not wish to make contact by using this line, direct contact is being made by the board with all GPs, giving them details of the periods of employment of this locum doctor and advising GPs of supports that are available. The South Eastern Health Board has also informed me that it has initiated a review of its procedures for the employment of locum doctors.</P>
      <P>I have asked officials of my Department to undertake an examination of all the circumstances surrounding recruitment of health professionals and to liaise with the relevant parties in order to determine how best to strengthen existing recruitment procedures and to ensure best practice is followed in all cases. If, arising from this examination and this case, any points emerge in relation to the adequacy of the legislative framework, these will be addressed in the context of the review of the Medical Practitioners Act, which is at an advanced stage. We are currently reviewing this Act with a view to new legislation which will update and supersede it. The issues that have arisen in this case can be dealt with in that.</P>

The public comments have been to that effect. We can pursue these issues further with the Medical Council.</P>
      <P>I understand the concern this has caused in the areas where this person worked and I am anxious to allay that concern as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing Deputy Penrose and myself to raise this important issue. Moate, County Westmeath, is a town of about 2,000 people located in the south of the county. It is on the main road between <Col N="984" /> Dublin and Galway and is situated about halfway between the two cities.</P>
      <P>The community of Moate is extremely active and has a tremendous community spirit. It has worked to produce Tuar Ard, a fantastic arts centre in the town, and Dún na Shí, a thriving heritage centre. It has many sporting clubs, a fine school and a new nursing home. Due to its location on this main national route, it is a hub of commercial activity.</P>
      <P>Each summer the town suffers a major shortage of water. The water supply has been intermittent, to put it mildly, in recent years and is a major embarrassment. It affects not only the commercial activity of Moate but also its prospects of future housing and industrial development and its attraction for people to locate there. I have previously described the water supply in Moate as akin to a Third World water supply. Many times during the summer it is not available during the day, only coming on for short periods at night. This is unacceptable. Something must be done. For a number of years various options were explored to find a new source and, at last, consultants have identified a way of solving the problem.</P>
      <P>A consultants' report was submitted to Westmeath County Council. It received approval there and was forwarded to the Department. The report states that a connection can be made from a good water supply in Ballymore and that water can be piped from there to Moate. That would augment the supply in Moate. The report was sent to the Department in April this year. It received technical approval within the Department but it has been sitting on the Minister's desk awaiting approval since then. It is unacceptable that it should lie there for so long.</P>
      <P>Why has this scheme not been approved? The long delay since April this year means that the possibility of having a quality water supply in Moate for next summer is probably in jeopardy. The people of Moate are not happy with this situation. They are a quiet, peace loving people but I wonder how long their patience will last. How long more will they tolerate this Minister sitting on his hands when, with the stroke of a pen, he can deliver a new water supply for the town? The Minister of State should tell the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that it is time to look after the people of south Westmeath. This scheme can be implemented. If he acts now, the water supply might be on stream for late next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGrath for sharing his time with me. What we are seeking tonight, as we have sought consistently in the past couple of years, is to advance the implementation of a permanent solution to the nightmare water supply problems that bedevil the large town of Moate, which is strategically located on the N6, <Col N="985" /> the main Dublin to Galway road. It is also an important town for the surrounding hinterland, a vast geographical area surrounding the thriving town.</P>
      <P>The town needs to end the uncertainty and unreliability of its water supply. It is a major drawback for consumers at all levels, be they householders, farmers or industrial consumers. Likewise the provision of a reliable supply is an important signal or assurance to people in the commercial sectors, such as entrepreneurs and small businesses, to locate their activities in the Moate area. This is important for the generation and attraction of employment, a most important consideration.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the long-term water supply requirements of these areas should be evaluated and addressed under the south Westmeath regional water supply scheme. However, that is a long-term solution so we must ensure interim solutions are put in place and Deputy McGrath and I proposed a number of these on the last occasion this matter was discussed in the House. I understand that stage 1 of the scheme, estimated to cost £9 million, is included in the Department's services investment programme as a scheme to advance to planning but this stage only addresses the water supply requirements for Athlone and its immediate environs. It appears from replies to parliamentary questions that completion of stage 1 is a necessary precursor to enable the scheme to serve Moate and other areas to progress.</P>
      <P>It is vital for the residents of the expanding town of Moate and its hinterland that the Department accelerates the process of putting in place a permanent solution to the serious problem which bedevils the town. It is a strategic town in economic, social, sporting and cultural terms. Let us stop procrastinating about consultants' reports, let the money be advanced and let the necessary water supply proceed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies McGrath and Penrose for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The provision of modern environmental infrastructure to support economic objectives has been a major focus of Government investment over the past four and a half years. Total planned spending on water services infrastructure over the period of the current national development plan amounts to almost £3 billion or 3.8 billion. This investment is aimed at supporting economic and social development, employment generation and the achievement of high environmental standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the water supply side, the subject of this motion, the additional production capacity created during last year alone is equal to the average daily requirements of a population equivalent of 309,000 persons. This represents, in one year, <Col N="986" /> 36% of the corresponding figure for the entire 1994 to 1999 period.</P>
    <P>The water services investment programme 2000-2002 is the first phase of a rolling programme to give effect to planned NDP spending on water services up to 2006. Total investment in County Westmeath in the first phase amounts to over £52 million &ndash; 66 million &ndash; in respect of 14 schemes. Approximately two thirds of the funding, over £34 million &ndash; 43 million &ndash; is for four large schemes that will deal with water supplies to serve Mullingar and south Westmeath, including Athlone and Moate, and sewerage schemes for Mullingar and Athlone. While preparing the programme for Westmeath between 2000 and 2002, my Department took into account the list of water and sewerage schemes adopted as priorities by the council after it was asked to undertake a fresh assessment of the need for capital works in Westmeath and to prioritise its proposals on the basis of the assessments.</P>

      <P>Westmeath County Council included the south Westmeath regional water supply scheme, which holds the long-term solution to Moate's water supply requirements, as part of its assessment of needs. The council has proposed that the scheme will have three stages. The first stage will upgrade the existing water supply to Athlone and its environs. The second stage, which must await completion of the first stage, involves the extension of the supply from Athlone to Moate and its environs, including the provision of a new reservoir at Knockdomney. The third stage will deal with the extension of public water mains to service the Tang and Glasson areas. The first stage has been included in the first phase of the water services investment programme and the subsequent stages cannot proceed until it has been implemented. I understand that Westmeath County Council has almost completed the revised preliminary report for the first stage, which it hopes to submit to the Department shortly. It will then be dealt with as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Westmeath County Council has informed my Department of the difficulties being encountered with the Moate water supply. As an interim solution, the council has augmented the supply to Moate from a ground water source at Knockdomney. This was commissioned late last year under the small schemes programme which is funded by the Department. A consultant's report on a further possible interim source, which would involve harnessing spare capacity from Ballymore, was submitted to my Department by the council earlier this year. As this proposal, which is estimated to cost £2 million &ndash; 2.53 million &ndash; was not included in the list of priority schemes <Col N="987" /> submitted by the council during the preparation of the current three-year water services investment programme, it has not been included in that programme. Further schemes will be added to the programme as it progresses up to the end of the national development plan and the Moate project will be carefully considered by the Minister in <Col N="988" /> that context. I assure Deputies McGrath and Penrose that I will make the Minister aware of the case they have made in its favour this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on the Department's behalf by the community welfare service of the health boards. The scheme is currently being reviewed by an inter-departmental working group chaired by my Department as part of its series of expenditure reviews. The working group is composed of representatives from my Department, the Departments of Finance and Health and Children and the health boards. The review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed primarily at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. All aspects of the scheme will be examined. The review also provides an opportunity to refocus the scheme, and the health boards' community welfare service of which it is part, to become more effective in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first stage of the review involved an examination of the objectives of the scheme and included a widespread consultation process. A total of 145 submissions were received from users of the supplementary welfare allowance service, information providers and other interested parties including the social partners, the health boards who administer the scheme and the trade unions representing community welfare officers. All of these submissions, including the submission from IMPACT to which Deputy Gilmore refers, will inform the deliberations of the working group. It is expected that sub-groups will be established to examine the specific issues raised during the consultation process, including the role of the community welfare officer. These officers as well as staff at the Department were invited to <Col N="990" /> nominate themselves for such groups if they wished to become involved in examining particular issues.</P>
    <P>The working group originally expected to complete the review by the end of this year. This will not now be achieved as progress has been slower than anticipated given the number and nature of the issues involved. It is now hoped that the review will be completed by autumn 2002. In parallel with this, I established a needs-assessment group to examine certain issues relating to the payment of reduced rate SWA to people who have means other than cash. This includes asylum seekers who have most of their needs met through the direct-provision system. Another relevant committee is the rent assistance planning group chaired by my Department, which is drawing up detailed proposals for a scheme of rent assistance to be operated by the local authorities. This will have a significant impact on the administration of the SWA rent supplement scheme. The reports from both the needs-assessment group and the rent assistance planning group are expected shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Social protection as described in EUROSTAT reports on &ldquo;The Social Situation in Europe&rdquo; covers not only the income support schemes administered by my Department, but also health care, supports with housing and other social and family services. I will just deal with the income support aspects.</P>
      <P>It is acknowledged in these reports that changes in levels of social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP are significantly influenced by the pace of economic growth and the level of unemployment. In the three year period 1990 to 1993, EU social protection expentiture as a percentage of GDP rose on average by over 3%, from 25.4% to 28.9%, as a result of the slower rate of economic growth and rising unemployment during that period. Over the five year period, 1994 to 1998, the percentage declined slightly to 27.7%, due to renewed economic growth and an actual decline in social protection expenditure in some countries, some of which would be attributable to the decline in unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For Ireland in 1990, expenditure on social protection as a percentage of GDP was 18.7%. This rose to 20.5% in 1993, and then declined to 16.1% in 1998. These changes mirrored the devel<Col N="991" /> opments just described in other EU countries, except that the level of economic growth and the decline in unemployment were much greater in Ireland than in most other EU countries. Annual rates of growth ranged from 8% to 11% in the period 1994 to 2000 and levels of unemployment declined from 14.3% to less than 4% over the same period.</P>
    <P>However, there was no reduction in the level of actual social protection expenditure during this period, but a substantial increase. The report shows that expenditure on social protection in Ireland per head of population rose by 44% in real terms, the third highest in the EU over this period. This significantly exceeded the average increase of 22% for the  EU as a whole.</P>
    <P>Levels of social protection expenditure are also affected by the numbers requiring benefits and services. I have already referred to the substantial fall in unemployment. With regard to the elderly, in 1999 those aged 65 and over in Ireland as a percentage of those in the working age group was just 17%, the lowest in the EU and a full 7% behind the EU average of 24%. As a result expenditure on old age and survivors' pensions in 1998 represented just 25% of total social protection expenditure in Ireland compared, for example, to an average of 46% for the EU15. This means that more of this expenditure is available for other categories than is the case in most other EU countries.</P>
    <P>Other factors which have a bearing on the amount of expenditure are the extent to which the State provides supplementary pensions, childcare and elder care and the way benefits are taxed. Lower State involvement, as in Ireland, means lower social protection expenditure.</P>
    <P>The EU report referred to by the Deputy only gives the situation in 1998, almost three full years ago. In the period since 1997 there have been major increases in expenditure notably on child benefit from £397 million &ndash; 504.1 million &ndash; annually in 1997 to £900 million &ndash; 1,143 million &ndash; currently and since 1997 on pensions amounting to between £18 &ndash; 22.86 &ndash; and £28 &ndash; 35.55 &ndash; per week or 36% to 43%.</P>
    <P>The policy of improving the standard of living of all those dependent on social protection will continue as resources permit guided by the national action plans. But the degree of progress that can be achieved in this area in all countries is dependent on continuing to achieve economic growth and maintaining a low level of unemployment.</P>

      <P>The Programme for <Col N="992" /> Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment that the establishment of a social insurance board with representation from the social partners will be examined over the lifetime of the programme. As the Deputy will be aware, the social insurance fund is in a healthy financial situation at present. The surpluses which have been a feature of the fund since 1997 require careful management to ensure that they are used to best long-term advantage, having consideration for foreseeable demands on the fund's resources and for the overall interest of social insurance contributors. It was announced at budget time that the Minister for Finance and I will, during the course of this year, conduct an examination of possible strategies in this regard. In order to inform such an examination, my Department has engaged external consultants to conduct an actuarial review of the social insurance fund for the period from 2001 to 2056 and this work is already under way. This review will build on the findings of the 1997 review in relation to social insurance based pensions as well as dealing for the first time with short-term benefits. It is envisaged that the review will be completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the review will inform short-to-medium and long-term policy development in relation to the social insurance system generally and the management of the social insurance fund resources. It will also directly feed into the examination of possible roles of a social insurance board and the social partners will be fully consulted as part of this process.</P>

      <P>There are a number of different aspects of individualisation in the social welfare system of which administrative individualisation is one. Administrative individualisation essentially concerns the delivery of direct payments to people who are currently supported through the payment of qualified adult allowance with various social welfare payments. A working group was established in October 2001 under the terms of the PPF to introduce proposals regarding the implementation of administrative individualisation within the social welfare system. The working group comprises representatives of the social partners, the Department of Finance and my Department, and is chaired by an officer of my Department. It has met on a total of five occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group's discussions to date have identified a number of key issues requiring detailed and careful examination. The work in this regard is at an advanced stage and the working group is due to meet again on 12 November 2001. Further pro<Col N="993" /> gress on administrative individualisation will depend on the outcome of these deliberations and I expect to have the group's report by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 51 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>The telephone allowance is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare-type payment or who meet the conditions of a means test. It is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare-type payments. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of telephone allowance retain that entitlement in order to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlement following the death of a spouse. From May this year the free schemes, including the telephone allowance, have been extended to all persons aged 70 and over regardless of their income and household composition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently more than 240,000 people in receipt of the telephone allowance. The free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion, namely: to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to availing of institutional care; and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society. The original objective of the telephone allowance was to provide an element of protection and security in their own homes for older people and people with disabilities who were either living alone or with people who would be unable to summon help in an emer<Col N="994" /> gency. A secondary objective of the scheme was to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.</P>
    <P>The free schemes act as an important support to encouraging care in the community. The proposal to extend the telephone allowance to pensioners resident in nursing homes does not fit easily within the community care objectives of these schemes. Persons resident in nursing homes may already be in receipt of State support, either through the public health system or through a nursing home subvention. In addition, those living in nursing homes and other residential institutions have daily support and contact with other residents and nursing staff. The current arrangements for the free schemes are kept under review. Any changes in the arrangements for the telephone allowance, as the Deputies have proposed, would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the context of overall Government priorities for the social welfare area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The household budget survey results for 1999-2000, recently released by the Central Statistics Office, are a welcome addition to our understanding of economic and social trends in modern Ireland. The findings of the household budget survey complement and support the ESRI analysis of the 1998 Living in Ireland survey, Monitoring Poverty Trends and Exploring Poverty Dynamics, which I launched last July. The latter survey shows significant reductions in the levels of consistent poverty in Ireland since 1994. Consistent poverty fell from 15% in 1994 to 8% in 1998, and we are therefore well on our way to achieving our revised national anti-poverty strategy target of below 5% by 2004. The number of people and households experiencing income as opposed to consistent poverty at the higher 60% <Col N="995" /> relative income line fell from 1994 to 1998. However, the proportion experiencing poverty at the lower 40% and 50% relative income poverty lines rose over the same period. This analysis is supported by the findings of the household budget survey which found that households at all income levels gained significantly in real terms over the period from 1994-5 to 1999-2000. It also found that the ratio between average weekly disposable income of households in the highest income decile compared with those in the lowest decile was 13:1 in 1999-2000, compared with 11:1 in 1994-5. However, this does not take account of the fact that households in the top income deciles are significantly larger than those in the lower deciles.</P>
    <P>The success of policies over recent years in combating unemployment and reducing the level of consistent poverty demonstrates a tangible improvement in the lot of those on lower incomes notwithstanding the very rapid increase in average incomes driven by economic success. Our commitment is to strive towards the creation of an inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity and incentive to participate in the social and economic life of the country. We have given practical effect to that commitment in our economic, labour market and budgetary policies. I can assure the House that this commitment will be further underlined in the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>In assessing means for unemployment assistance account is taken of any cash income the person may have, for example earnings from employment or self-employment, together with the value of any capital or property. For the purposes of assessing cash income, account is normally taken of the income that the person may reasonably be expected to receive during the coming 12 months. Under the unemployment assistance scheme, where a person works for up to three days a week, earnings are assessed at 60%. In addition, persons without children are allowed a £10 or 12.70 disregard for each day worked, while the balance of earnings is assessed at 60%. These measures are designed to ensure that claimants have an incentive to work at all levels of earnings even where the level of pay is less than the rate of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> The introduction of a provision whereby increases provided to part-time employees under partnership agreements would be disregarded for the purposes of the UA means assessment could give rise to serious inequities in the system. First, a claimant taking up part-time work subsequent to the payment of the PPF increase would not benefit from the proposed disregard. This would mean that he/she would receive a lower rate of unemployment assistance than a claimant on the same income who started employment prior to the award of the PPF increase. Secondly, those due a proportionately higher salary increase would stand to gain more from such a disregard. In addition, it would be necessary to provide for an equivalent disregard across the range of means-tested scheme. The implementation of the measure could therefore be extremely costly. The proposed measure would run counter to the underlying purpose of the means tests used by my Department which is to ensure that the limited resources available are directed at those most in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will recall, the budget last December provided for a £10 or 12.70 per week increase for pensioners over 66; an additional special increase of £2.90 or 3.68 per week, giving a total increase of £12.90 or 16.38, for widow's contributory pensioners aged over 66 years; and an £8 or 10.16 increase for recipients under 66. The £10 or 12.70 increase for pensioners represented an increase of between 10.4% and 11.7%, while the £8 or 10.16 general increase represented an increase of between 9% and 10.5%. These increases are substantially in excess of inflation, which is forecast to be 4.5% this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Government took up office, social welfare payments have been substantially increased in real terms. For example, social welfare pensioners aged 66 years and over have received total increases of between 38% and 41.2% compared with an increase of 16.4% in the cost of living during the same period. In addition, we have already brought forward the date of increases in weekly rates of payment so that they coincide with the commencement of the tax year. This position will be maintained in the context of the alignment of the tax and calendar year from January 2002. This will mean that increases in weekly rates will take place a full 23 weeks earlier than when we came into office. The progressively <Col N="997" /> earlier payment of increases must be taken into account when assessing the real level of increases provided by this Government over its period of office.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to increasing, in 2002, the rate of widow's contributory pension for those aged over 66 to the rate of old age contributory pension; increasing qualified adult allowance to 70% of personal rate, also in 2002; increasing old age pensions in line with average industrial earnings increases; and making substantial progress towards £100 or 126.97 for the lowest rates of social welfare. My priorities for Budget 2002 will include making further progress towards implementing these commitments and responding where possible to the various proposals and concerns brought to my attention during the course of the budget process, having regard to the available resources.</P>

      <P>As outlined in the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship between the State and the Community and Voluntary Sector, the Government decided that responsibility for charity regulatory matters and the office of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests should transfer from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The order to effect this transfer was made on 27 July 2001. The White Paper recognised the need for a more modern legal framework and stated the Government's commitment to ensuring the introduction of comprehensive legislation on regulation of charities and charitable fund-raising. The work of reviewing the legislation which is currently under way in my Department will be accompanied by a broad public consultation on the appropriate regulatory framework and the nature and extent of the legislative reform required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has recently held discussions with the Law Reform Commission on this question. The commission has indicated that they will shortly commence an examination of charity law with a view to producing a report on the necessary legal reforms. My Department is working in close co-operation with the commission in the preparation of the consultation document and in the reform of the charities legislation. It has recently sought proposals for consultants to review certain specific subjects in preparation for the public consultation. A wide range of views <Col N="998" /> exist on the complicated questions that arise in reviewing the current legislation. The fundamental nature of the review being carried out argues for the broadest possible consultation with sufficient time allowed for consideration of such important issues. It is envisaged that proposals for legislative reform can be introduced following completion of the consultation process.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recommendation of many pre-budget submissions that child dependent allowances should be standardised and increased as a targeted child income support measure.</Quest>
      <QRef>[26848/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently three different rates of child dependent allowances payable to social welfare recipients, ranging from £13.20 or 16.76 euro per week to £17.00 or 21.59 euro per week. Since the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, which recommended a rationalisation of the rates of child dependent allowances, the number of different rates has been reduced from 36 to the current three. Further rationalisation, to bring all child dependent allowances up to the highest rate currently paid, would cost in the order of £49 million, or 62.22 million euro, annually.</P>
      <P>The loss of child dependent allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities. The policy direction followed by successive Governments has therefore been to concentrate resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme which is neutral <i>vis-à-vis </i>the employment status of the parents and does not contribute to poverty traps. The Government's commitment to this policy is reflected in the substantial resources we have invested in the child benefit scheme since entering office.</P>
      <P>Over our first three budgets annual expenditure on child benefit increased to £575 million, or 730.1 million euro, a rise of more than 40% compared to pre-election levels. Following payment in June of the historic increases in child benefit rates of £25, or 31.74 euro, and £30, or 38.09 euro, per month, total expenditure on child benefit is now over £900 million or 1,143 million euro per year. With increases of the same order due in each of the next two years total Government investment in the scheme will have risen to some £1.5 billion, or 1.9 billion euro, by the end of 2003. This means that we will have moved from a position in 1994 where 70% of child income support for a family claiming social welfare payments was in the form of child dependent allowances to a position in 2003 where child dependent allowances will account for less than 33%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> The issue of increasing child dependent allowances has been raised in a number of pre-budget submissions. However, I believe that investment in the child benefit scheme is still the correct approach and represents the most effective use of the resources available for child income support.</P>

      <P>A total of 13,600 students participated in the student summer jobs scheme in 1998, 9,200 participated in 1999 and 5,902 took part in last year's scheme. A total of 6,081 students were approved to participate in this year's scheme and to date sponsors have claimed reimbursement for 4,490 participating students. The primary and underlying purpose of the scheme since its inception in 1993 has been to provide useful work experience and income support for less well-off third level students who do not have access to unemployment payments during the summer. As the above figures indicate, however, interest in the scheme has been declining over the last few years due to the buoyancy of the labour market and the wider availability of summer work. This is an encouraging trend and it is obviously better for students to obtain work in the open market than to have to rely on support from the State.</P>
      <P>This year I decided to pay an extra £1, or 1.27, per hour to those students who come from households dependent on social welfare payments, providing for a maximum payment of £800, or 1,015.79, for 200 hours of work. It is estimated that over 800 students will have benefited from this when all claims for reimbursement have been processed. In addition, approved students who are in receipt of disability allowance or blind person's pension were eligible to participate in the scheme this year.</P>

      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy was launched in April 1997. The current overall target is to reduce the numbers of those who are consistently poor from 9-15% of the population to less than 5% by 2004 and we are well on the way to achieving this. Under the PPF, we made a commitment to revise and review <Col N="1000" /> the national anti-poverty strategy. The methodology underlying the strategy will be reviewed and existing targets reviewed and revised where appropriate. New targets will be considered under the themes of child poverty, women's poverty, health, older people, housing and accommodation and ethnic groups. Indicators will be considered under the national anti-poverty strategy themes so that achievement of targets can be monitored over time.</P>
      <P>A number of working groups with social partner representation were established to facilitate the review of targets and the development of indicators and policies to meet targets. The areas covered were housing and accommodation, health, employment, education, rural poverty and urban disadvantage and income adequacy. A separate working group was also established to examine the issues in relation to benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments. The reports of each working group were summarised by external consultants and a draft revised strategy was presented to a steering committee for discussion. The members of the committee include the convenors from the working groups, representatives from relevant Departments, and representatives of the social partners and relevant agencies. The work of the steering committee is now virtually complete with final amendments to the draft framework document currently being made. The draft revised national anti-poverty strategy will be submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion for consideration. Following this, the revised NAPS will be presented to Government, which will make final decisions in relation to the proposed targets.</P>
      <P>The review of the strategy allows for the consideration and inclusion of new themes that have emerged as national priorities over the past number of years.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently published NESF report on lone parents states that the poverty risk for lone parent families, defined as the number of lone parent <Col N="1001" /> families falling below the 50% poverty line, increased from 17% in 1987 to 29% in 1994. Recent data indicates that the risk remained at that level in 1997. I welcome the publication of the NESF report. It is a good contribution to the debate about lone parents, which I called for on the publication of my Department's review of the one-parent family payment in September 2000. In fact the conclusions of the NESF report echo to a great extent the findings of that review. However, the NESF report takes a much broader look at the issues affecting lone parents, which are dealt with across a range of Departments and agencies. Emphasis is placed on the structure of training courses and education schemes and the other supports, particularly childcare, that lone parents need to enable them to train and work. The need for pre-training courses to help build confidence and for running courses at times and locations which meet the needs of those with small children are all highlighted. Issues of housing, disincentives to marry or cohabit and the position of single fathers are also explored. The implementation of many of the NESF's recommendations are proper to other Government Departments, local authorities and agencies.</P>
    <P>I have already taken action on many of the issues raised in the NESF report which come under the remit of my Department, including the initiation of a proactive programme of supports for one-parent family payment recipients to ensure that they are aware of the employment, education and training options available to them. It has been shown that the risk of poverty is greatly reduced where a lone parent works outside the home. The one-parent family payment is designed to allow lone parents to avail of such opportunities where they choose to. I also intend to localise the administration of the one-parent family payment scheme. In that regard a pilot project is currently under way in the Department's Tallaght office. I included provisions in the Social Welfare Act, 2001 to allow recipients of the one-parent family payment to retain 50% of maintenance received in addition to the existing disregard in respect of housing costs. In addition, the supplementary allowance scheme is currently being reviewed as part of the Department's expenditure review programme, where issues concerning rent and mortgage supplements are being addressed.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to increasing child benefit by £1 billion, or 1.27 billion euro, over three years. In this year's budget I provided for an increase of £25, or 31.74 euro, per month first and second children and £30, or 38.09 euro, per month for third and subsequent children. Lone parents and their children will benefit greatly from these commitments. The Government is strongly committed to eliminating poverty for all our people and in this regard recognises the particular risk of poverty faced by lone parents.</P>

      <P>In September 1999, the Deputy submitted a report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family Affairs based on the report, Towards a Senior Euro Pass, which was commissioned by the Social Affairs Directorate of the European Commission and undertaken and published by Age Concern, England at the end of 1997. The Age Concern report recommends that EU states should establish a senior Euro pass card which would entitle older people to concessions on various services including travel, cultural and social activities. The role of my Department in matters relating to the senior euro pass has been to submit observations, as required, in conjunction with other Departments and statutory and non-statutory bodies on any action taken to implement the proposals in this report, in so far as they affect the business of this Department. While the introduction of a senior euro pass would be a welcome addition to the very generous travel and other concessions our older citizens already enjoy within the State I understand that further work on this issue has been suspended at EU level. As I have previously informed the Deputy, I consider the design and administration of such a scheme to be outside the remit of my Department.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was produced by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice in September. It sets out the results of a small-scale study which sought to explore the experiences of people on social welfare or on relatively low incomes in Dublin city and to examine how they managed their weekly income. The report recommends that social welfare rates and child benefit rates should be increased significantly in order to alleviate the risk of poverty. These results were based on the social welfare rates for 1999 and thus do not take account of the substantial <Col N="1003" /> increases we have seen in both weekly welfare rates and child benefit rates since then.</P>
      <P>The recent report of the social welfare benchmarking and indexation group noted the difficulties associated with deriving a definition of adequacy which is indisputable and universally accepted. This Government has shown, however, that it is firmly committed to significant improvements in social welfare. Increases have amounted to over £1.8 billion since we came into office. The forthcoming budget will further underline this commitment. The report produced by the Vincentian Partnership also highlights the importance of employment as a pathway out of poverty and draws attention to the importance of the provision of affordable childcare and flexible working arrangements in this regard. This finding accords with Government policy and is reflected in the unprecedented level of unemployment of just less than 4% we have experienced in recent times, in the very significant investments being made by Government in the area of childcare, and in the development of family-friendly employment policies.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I successfully introduced the Second Stage of the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2001 to the Seanad on 4 October. As I indicated at the time of publication in July, I welcomed comments and reaction to the Bill and stated that these would be considered in detail during the passage of the Bill. The deadline for receipt of comments was the end of September and there has been a considerable response, which is not unusual given the size, scope and technical nature of this legislation. All the responses will be examined by my Department in consultation with the Pensions Board and the various bodies, with a view to bringing forward any required amendments at Committee Stage. A positive aspect was that there was broad cross party support for the proposals during the Second Stage debate in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for, among other things, the establishment of a Pensions Ombudsman on a statutory basis. His/her decisions will be binding <Col N="1004" /> subject to a right of appeal to the High Court. The scope of the Ombudsman will relate to complaints regarding maladministration of schemes and disputes of fact or law between beneficiaries and those responsible for the management of the scheme or PRSA. The time limit for bringing complaints or disputes to the Ombudsman will be three years from the action giving rise to the grievance or longer if the Ombudsman so decides, subject to the overall limit of three years prior to establishment of the Office. I also intend, as I indicated on publication of the Bill, to introduce further improvements during the passage of this Bill. These will include issues concerning EU law on equal treatment, the EU Mobility Directive, and the setting up of a limited pensions compensation fund. I expect to introduce Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad in December with a view to having the Bill fully enacted as early as possible in 2002. The office of the Pensions Ombudsman will be established as soon as possible following this enactment.</P>

      <Quest>if financial disincentives exist for lone parents who choose to marry or cohabit which deter them from so doing; if he proposes to take steps to correct these disincentives; and his views on whether the NESF's recommendation that the matter be further studied by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs is a sufficiently decisive response to this problem.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The social welfare system in general is contingency based and assumes that there are economies of scale where two people are married or cohabiting. In the circumstances, under the present system a reduction in income is inevitable where a person changes status from being a lone parent to one where he-she marries or cohabits. Clearly a payment which is based on the contingency of lone parenthood cannot continue where the person marries or cohabits. Where both of a couple are welfare recipients the losses are eased to some extent by payment of the qualified adult allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue was examined in detail in a number of reports in recent years, including the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, 1999, and the review of the one-parent family payment or OFP, 2000. In neither case was a solution to the problem put forward with the contingency nature of the social welfare system as a whole identified as one of the major obstacles to a resolution. The NESF in its recent report on lone parents also examined the issue and, while it made no definite recommendations, it has put forward some <Col N="1005" /> suggestions for further consideration. Its main suggestion revolves around giving lone parents who marry or cohabit access to the unemployment assistance or UA scheme so that they may retain a full personal payment. A household means test would still apply and the UA scheme would be amended to exempt parents from the requirement to actively seek work until their youngest child was five years of age, with a part-time work requirement applying until the child was 12 years of age. The NESF sees the system as needing a much broader application with all qualified adults opting for this conditionality if they wish to receive a full personal rate and work tests also applying to those who remain as lone parents.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion involves transitional arrangements whereby one-parent family payment recipients could retain a full payment for a period after they marry or commence cohabiting. The payment of lump sums is also explored as an option. The NESF acknowledges that such arrangements would be difficult to administer and could create other disincentives. They could also place other couples at a disadvantage compared to couples containing a former lone parent. The NESF considers that if its suggestions were developed into a realistic proposal for restructuring of present arrangements they would not only address disincentives for family formation but also the problems associated with the status of women as dependants in the welfare system and the mobilisation of the domestic labour supply.</P>
    <P>The NESF suggestions are welcome as a contribution to policy discussion in this area. However, because of the fundamental changes envisaged for the social welfare system and the general principle underlying the changes, I consider that it is appropriate that they should be examined further before any decision is made in regard to implementation.</P>

      <P>The United Nations has proclaimed 2001 as the international year of volunteers, known as IYV 2001, with the objective of promoting and enhancing recognition of volunteer service. On 21 November 2000, as provided for in the PPF, I established the National Committee on Volunteering, under the chairmanship of Deputy Flood. The key functions of the committee are to develop awareness of the role volunteers play in Irish society; to provide support for voluntary and community organisations at local and national level in highlighting and celebrating the role of volunteers in their organis<Col N="1006" /> ations; to provide a national focus for volunteering in the context of IYV 2001; and to oversee the management of IYV 2001. The committee has a broad-based membership of 38 with representatives drawn from leading NGOs, foundations, community and voluntary groups, universities with related research or training roles, business and industry and relevant Government Departments. The committee, which is supported by a small full-time secretariat, will be in place for a period of two years, after which time its membership and future role will be reviewed.</P>
      <P>A budget of £1 million, or 1,269,73,8 has been allocated to the National Committee on Volunteering for its work during IYV 2001. Some £350,000, or 444,408, of this was set aside by the committee for a grant scheme to mark IYV 2001. Grants were awarded to over 80 community and voluntary groups in July 2001. During IYV 2001, the committee has focused primarily on organising events to celebrate volunteering and its contribution to society. Many such events, ranging from locally-based celebrations of volunteers to national cultural promotions of volunteer activity, such as the commissioning of five Irish poets to reflect on volunteering, have taken place. The culmination of the year's events will be a major cross-border conference on volunteering in County Cavan on 26 and 27 November 2001, organised jointly with the authorities in Northern Ireland. The end of IYV 2001 in Ireland will be marked on 10 December by a presentation by the Taoiseach of a specially commissioned piece of sculpture to each local authority in Ireland. The piece will acknowledge and celebrate the huge contribution that volunteer activity has made to Irish society.</P>
      <P>During 2002 the committee will continue to examine issues related to volunteering, including the possibilities for recognition and accreditation for voluntary work and for training undertaken as a volunteer; measures to widen the pool of volunteers; and the range of supports needed in order to promote, sustain and develop volunteering. The committee will report to Government at the end of 2002.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to extending pension cover to as many categories as possible. In recent years more flexibility has been introduced into the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory pension scheme. Measures introduced include the reduction in 1997 of the average number of PRSI contributions required for pension purposes to ten and the payment of a special half rate pension, introduced in 2000, based on pre-53 insurance contributions. <i>Pro rata</i> pensions are also available for people with mixed insurance contributions. These measures are making it easier for people, particularly women, with reduced or broken insurance records to qualify for a contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present it is estimated that about 86% of women over 65 years of age are receiving a social welfare payment. Of these 90% have a payment in their own right with about 64% of those who have a payment receiving one based on their PRSI record. However, I recognise that more can be done in this area and in August 2000, I launched the report on phase one of the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions which identified the key issues for qualification conditions. Phase two of the review is, among other things, examining the homemakers' scheme with particular reference to converting the existing system of disregards to credited contributions. It is expected that the phase two report will be finalised shortly. The Government also decided to increase the rate of the qualified adult allowance for those over 66 years of age to the full old age non-contributory pension rate. A major step towards this objective was taken in this year's budget by providing an increase of £15 per week in the full-rate qualified adult allowance. Following consideration of the report of the PPF working group which is currently examining the issues <Col N="1008" /> of administrative individualisation, it is hoped that arrangements can be put in place for as many qualified adults as possible to receive their payment directly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of adult literacy is primarily a matter to be addressed through the education system. My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, has put in place a range of initiatives in the education field to address this problem in more effective and innovative ways than in the past, as set out in the White Papers on Adult Education. The figures quoted by the Deputy refer to a survey carried out by my Department among unemployed people in Galway. There is a range of back to education programmes operated through the employment support services of the Department. These programmes are designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to build up skills and qualifications which will enable them to compete in the workplace.</P>
      <P>The Department's back to education programmes range from basic literacy courses to postgraduate university courses and include the back-to-education allowance scheme &ndash; BTEA &ndash; which covers second and third level courses, the education, training and development option and the part-time education option. The BTEA is an educational opportunities scheme for persons who wish to pursue approved second or third level courses of education. There are two options available under this scheme, the second-level option and the third-level option. Under the education, training and development option courses that are not covered under the BTEA scheme may be approved. This option covers a broad range of courses, including personal development courses, basic education classes comprising literacy classes and numeracy training, general training courses and the acquisition of specific job skills. Persons availing of this option retain their unemployment payment and are deemed to be available for work for the duration of the course. Furthermore, the back to education programmes recognise that many unemployed people wish to pursue part-time courses of education as an alternative to the more structured full-time course. People can pursue a broad range of part-time courses, including literacy courses, and retain their social welfare payment, once they remain available for employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, in recognition of the fact that attendance at literacy and other courses may entail expenses for those on a tight budget, I introduced <Col N="1009" /> an allowance of £25, or 31.74, per week to cover the cost of travel and meals for long-term unemployed people who attend approved training and development courses run by locally based service providers. My Department's job facilitator network uses this allowance in tackling and identifying literacy and other problems which are impediments to employment and training among the long-term unemployed. It is hoped that up to 1,000 people will avail of this option in 2002. As part of their normal intervention with the long-term unemployed, job facilitators also organise training programmes in literacy and numeracy through vocational education committees where they identify such needs. All job facilitators and information officers in my Department receive literacy training from the National Adult Literacy Agency, which helps them to recognise and take action on literacy problems. Finally, the vocational training opportunities scheme which is administered by the Department of Education and Science through the vocational education committees has been operating since 1989 and was established as a special initiative designed to cater for the particular education and training needs of the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises that literacy problems are a major impediment to full participation in society and are committed to aiming resources at those most at risk from long-term unemployment due to the lack of such skills.</P>

      <P>There were 88,734 lone parent claims in payment at the end of September 2001, the latest date for which statistics are available. These include separated or unmarried clients in receipt of the one-parent family payment introduced in 1997 and also those still receiving the former lone parent allowance or payments under the deserted wife's benefit and allowance schemes. Under social welfare legislation, applicants for these schemes are required to make ongoing efforts to seek adequate maintenance from their former spouses, or in the case of unmarried applicants, the parents of their child. Such maintenance is normally obtained by way of negotiation or by court order under family <Col N="1010" /> law, though separated couples are increasingly using the family mediation service which my Department has been extending countrywide.</P>
      <P>Under the relevant provisions of the Social Welfare Acts, a person has a legal responsibility to support his-her spouse and dependent children. Where social welfare support is being provided to the one-parent family, the other parent is legally liable to contribute to the cost of that support. The relevant legislation allows my Department to seek recovery from liable relatives through the courts in appropriate cases. Information is not available on the number of one-parent family payment clients who are in receipt of maintenance from the other parent. Neither is information available on the number of such clients who have taken legal action in pursuit of such maintenance. Independent research shows, however, that only 13% of family law court maintenance orders are honoured regularly. A review of the one-parent family payment was conducted as part of the Department's expenditure review programme.</P>
      <P>On the issue of maintenance, the review recommended that maintenance recovery activity be intensified while bearing in mind value-for-money considerations. It was also proposed that OFP claimants be allowed to retain 50% of any maintenance they secure, as an encouragement for them to seek maintenance. This recommendation was adopted and provision accordingly was made in the Social Welfare Act, 2001. In the light of the review my Department has intensified its efforts in pursuing people who default on their obligations. The resources devoted to this activity have been increased. Procedures have been revised and maintenance recovery activity commences within three weeks of each new award of OFP. There are currently 652 liable relatives contributing to my Department. Those who default in their obligations under this legislation will be pursued in appropriate cases, if necessary through legal action. A number of cases are under consideration for legal proceedings at present.</P>
      <P>The operation of these arrangements is under active review and the question of further changes, if any, will be considered in the light of the experience gained.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 50, 57 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The Family Support Agency Bill was published on 13 July 2001 and is at present before Dáil Éireann. The new agency will bring together the main programmes and pro-family services introduced in recent years in line with the Government's Families First approach and for which some £12 million or 15.24 million has been allocated to my Department this year for the development of family services, up from £1.5 million or 1.9 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>The Family Support Agency will provide a family mediation service; support, promote and develop the provision of marriage and relationship counselling and other family support services; support, promote and develop the family and community services resource centre programme; provide information on these services and on parenting issues; and undertake research and advise me as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs about family matters. All of these separate activities are currently taking place in my Department but it is my own view and that of the Government that a State agency which will report to me affords the opportunity to bring coherence into this complex area. Thus the Family Support Agency will provide a comprehensive and coherent response for families in need of these services and for families generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family resource centres are an essential component of the Families First approach in building neighbourhood solidarity and responding to families locally. This is why they have been singled out by Government in recent years for radical improvement and expansion, a course recommended by the Commission on the Family. In 1997, there were ten centres. In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to the establishment of 100 centres. To date there are 75 centres either operational or approved for inclusion in the programme. The Family Support Agency legislation provides an enabling framework within which the Government have decided that the Family Resource Centre programme can be further developed in line with these commitments. Furthermore, the Family Support Agency will be an important resource for the work of the centres, <Col N="1012" /> enhancing the role and capacity of these local community initiatives in responding to families at neighbourhood level.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides specifically that in carrying out its responsibilities the agency will have regard to Government social inclusion priorities and that it will work with other public bodies with a shared interest in family matters. This is designed to ensure a strong social inclusion focus to its work and a prioritisation of the needs of the most vulnerable families, important objectives which will continue to inform the work of the Family Resource Centre programme under the Family Support Agency.</P>
    <P>All of these matters are the focus of ongoing discussions between officials of my Department and the Family Resource Centre forum. Officials from my Department met representatives of the family resource centres on 6 July 2001. A meeting with the Family Resource Centre forum took place on 26 September and a further meeting at official level is planned for 13 November. I officially launched the Family Resource Centre forum two weeks ago and spoke to representatives from centres throughout the country about the new agency and how it will support their work in the future. I heard at first hand their hopes for the agency and their desire to play a key role in all aspects of its operation. I will consider carefully the points that were made and also those raised in discussions with officials of my Department. The Government plans for the Family Support Agency were first announced on 15 May 2001, which was the UN international day of families. Representatives from over 300 voluntary and community groups providing family support services, the social partners and public representatives were invited to the launch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>During 2000, the number of people availing of their statutory right to appeal against decisions made by deciding officers of my Department increased to 17,650 from the 1999 figure of 15,465. Appeals relating to unemployment benefit and assistance payments mainly account for the increase. The question at issue in these appeals for the most part is whether the statutory conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking suitable employment are satisfied in particular cases, taking account of the increased opportunities in the lab<Col N="1013" /> our market. The increased level of activity in this area through the Government's employment action programme and otherwise would tend to result in increasing numbers of such appeals. Other significant increases during 2000 were in the carer's allowance and disability allowance schemes. The conditions for entitlement to these have been amended over recent years, extending and easing entitlement, and it is considered that the increased number of appeals in these categories is as a result of an increased level of claims arising from these extensions.</P>
      <P>All decisions on claims for benefits under the statutory social welfare schemes are made by deciding officers with reference to the relevant legislation. However, the number of appeals received against decisions made by deciding officers represents only a fraction of the total number of such decisions made. For example, the figure of 17,650 appeals received by the appeals office last year should be seen in the context of a total of some two million new and revised decisions made by deciding officers.</P>
      <P>In other words, in over 99% of cases the persons concerned accepted the deciding officer's decision. Of all appeals received, about 21% were allowed or partially allowed, nearly 42% were disallowed, 22% of cases were revised by the deciding officer and 15% were withdrawn. When an appeal is received, the appeals office refers the case to the deciding officer for his or her comments on the arguments made by the appellant, including any new evidence submitted. As a result of this process over one-fifth of such cases were revised in the person's favour by deciding officers, essentially because new evidence was available that warranted revision.</P>
      <P>It is my Department's policy to ensure that persons who receive unfavourable decisions are provided with the means to have such decisions reviewed as quickly as possible. What we want to achieve is that where new evidence becomes available after a decision is made, that evidence is submitted directly to the deciding officer in the first instance so that the case can be re-examined quickly and, if appropriate, the decision revised without having to go through the more lengthy appeals process. To this end my Department is developing systems to review decisions in the light of any further information brought to notice following the initial decision and to ensure that claimants are advised of their right to seek such a review. During this year a management consultancy study will be undertaken of the role, functions and organisation of the appeals office, including examination of all the processes involved in dealing with claims to the appeals stage. Any necessary procedural improvements which are identified in the course of this examination will be implemented.</P>

      <P>Grandparenthood in Modern Ireland was completed under the families research programme which I introduced to support innovative, original research in the field of family policy and family services. Grandparenthood in Modern Ireland is the first study of grandparents to have been undertaken in this country. The study was conducted by Dr. Francesca Lundstrom on behalf of Age Action Ireland and with the assistance of funding under the families research programme. The study aims to challenge negative attitudes towards ageing and older people by drawing attention to one of the more positive gains in later life. It includes an examination of the available sources of literature on grandparenthood and grandparenting in the USA, Canada and the UK. It explores the demographics of grandparents in Ireland and elsewhere, family relationships and the factors which affect grandparents' involvement with their grandchildren as well as the role of grandparents as carers.</P>
      <P>The study assesses the strengths and weaknesses of supports available for grandparents in other countries and it describes the rights of grandparents in relation to ongoing relationships with their grandchildren in marital separation situations in the USA, Scotland and Ireland. The study includes the results of interviews with 58 grandparents to obtain their perspective on all of these issues and their experiences of being a grandparent in Ireland. The findings illustrate the continuing importance and value of grandparents in the lives of modern Irish families, the energy and commitment they bring to their relationships with their children and their grandparenting roles, their concerns about issues such as marital breakdown and lone parenthood, their hopes for the future for themselves, their children and their grandchildren and their suggestions as to how they may be better supported in their grandparenting roles in the changing social and economic circumstances facing families today.</P>
      <P>In all, the report provides much need baseline information about grandparents' perspectives on their role and their contribution in family life today. It will be used to contribute to the development of effective family-centred policies and services as promised in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium. The report has been widely circulated and has been welcomed by policy makers, legislators, researchers and interest groups involved in the promotion of family well being.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the budget process, I held a pre-budget forum on 15 October. The forum was attended by 28 groups representative of a wide variety of welfare organisations, community and voluntary organisations and other interested groups. A broad range of proposals for the budget were put forward at the forum and the main proposals were as follows: substantial increases in weekly social welfare payments; qualified adult allowances to be significantly increased as a percentage of personal rates in 2002; significant increases in monthly child benefit payments; substantial improvements to the carer's allowance, particularly in relation to the means test; and a wide range of other improvements.</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency also attended this forum and I have recently received a pre-budget submission from the agency. In its submission, the agency recommends setting a specific target for income poverty reduction, designed to improve the position of the poorest members of society. This would involve targeting surplus resources on welfare expenditure and not tax reductions. The establishment of an inclusive society, where all citizens have the opportunity and the incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country, is a fundamental objective of the Government. In formulating proposals for inclusion in the 2002 budget, therefore, the Government will be endeavouring to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are invested in our social infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the improvements provided for in the last four budgets, substantial progress has already been made in this regard. For instance, last year's social welfare improvements package was the biggest ever, amounting to over £850 million, or 1,079 million, on a full year basis. In this context, it should be noted that the full year cost of the main proposals sought by the various groups at the pre-budget forum was estimated at more than £4,000 million, or 5,100 million. My priorities for budget 2002 will include making further progress towards implementing the various programme and other Government commitments and responding where possible to the various proposals and concerns brought to my <Col N="1016" /> attention during the course of the budget process, with regard to the available resources.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. Certain people on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance. Under the scheme an allowance of £63, or 79.99, is payable in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £78, or 99.04, is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years. Full statistics for the scheme for this year are not yet available. While the closing date for applications was 30 September 2001, processing and payment of late claims is ongoing. The final returns from the health boards are not expected until later this year. However, current indications are that about 64,500 families consisting of about 150,000 children will have benefited from the scheme. The estimated expenditure on this year's scheme will be in the region of £10.7 million, or 13.6 million.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties faced by low-income households when faced with providing clothing and footwear for children at back-to-school time in September each year. I am also very conscious of the importance of supporting low income families so that their children can participate fully in the education system to the maximum extent possible. In that regard, I established a working group to undertake a review of the scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review has examined all aspects of the scheme including the rates of payment as well the income limits, the means test, time of payment, the eligibility criteria and other issues. I expect to have the working group's final report in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years I have introduced several measures in order to improve the position of widowed people within the social welfare system. In the 2000 budget I introduced a new scheme, the widowed parent grant, to help with the special needs of this particular group in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement. This involves the payment of a special grant of £1,000 or 1,270 to a widow-widower with dependent children. There is also a bereavement grant of £500 or 635 available upon the death of a spouse. Where the deceased person was a social welfare recipient, arrangements are in place to continue the payments to the widow-widower for six weeks after the bereavement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the Government's commitment to pensioners and as announced in budget 2001, I decided to increase the widow's contributory pension rate for those aged over 66 to the full old age contributory rate over two budgets. The special increase of £12.50 or 15.87 per week which I brought in this year is the first step in this process. Widows and widowers are also benefiting from the changes in the free schemes which I announced in budget 2001 and which came into effect in May. Under these arrangements all persons aged over 70 years of age are entitled to the full range of schemes regardless of their means or household composition. The increase in the rates of child benefit which came into effect in June are of benefit to widows and widowers with children. Monthly child benefit payments are now £67.50 or 85.71 per month for each of the first and second children and £86 or 109.2 per month for the third and subsequent children. In addition, there are special arrangements in place whereby a person in receipt of a widow's pension or one-<Col N="1018" /> parent family payment may also receive half-rate disability benefit or unemployment benefit in addition to their pension. This provision applies where the person satisfies the relevant contribution conditions and dual payment can continue for up to 15 months. The position with regard to social welfare provision for widowed people will be kept under review in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Overpayments of social welfare can arise for a variety of reasons, including fraud or suspected fraud on the part of claimants as well as errors in the provision of information and in the processing of claims. It is the policy of my Department to try to recover in full all moneys incorrectly paid. Since 1996 a code of practice has been in place to regulate this process. The code provides that due account be taken of the interests of taxpayers and social insurance contributors, including employers, who finance the various social welfare payments, as well as the ability of the person to pay. The code gives guidance in relation to the method and pace of recovery and the circumstances whereby an overpayment assessed against a person may be deferred, suspended, reduced or cancelled. In particular, the code stipulates that the repayment of an overpayment assessed against a person may be reduced or cancelled where it arose because of an error by the Department or a health board and where the person concerned could not reasonably have been expected to be aware of the error or failure. I am satisfied that the current code of practice governing the assessment and recovery process regulates the various elements in a fair and consistent manner.</P>

      <P>My Department has since 1996 operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance. Voluntary or community-based groups seeking funding under the scheme must satisfy the defined eligibility criteria, comply with Government tax clearance procedures and provide satisfactory accounts in respect of previously paid grants. I am anxious that this scheme continues to operate in a way that benefits the most vulnerable older people in our society. With this in mind my Department keeps the administrative procedures applying to the scheme under review and makes amendments as appropriate. My Department also monitors the scheme on an ongoing basis to ensure that those organisations receiving funding under the scheme are complying with all the scheme regulations and requirements. Officials of my Department are in contact with the particular group and I understand a meeting is being arranged to discuss the various issues that have been raised.</P>

People in this situation had their maintenance costs and an element of pocket money met through funding from the appropriate health board. However, since the takeover of the disability allowance scheme by my Department this disqualification has been progressively relaxed, as follows: from October 1996 disability allowance is continued for up to 13 weeks where the person is admitted to hospital for treatment; with effect from June 1997 disability allowance is paid at half-rate for those in part-time residential care. In addition, people who come home for an extended holiday period of three weeks or more can qualify for allowance for that period; since August 1999 existing recipients of disability allowance who are living at home can retain their entitlement where they subsequently go into hospital or residential care; from May 2000 people in part-time residential care who had been <Col N="1020" /> entitled to half-rate disability allowance since June 1997 became entitled to payment at the full rate.</P>
      <P>In addition, people living in community-based residences are eligible to receive disability allowance provided the relevant health board is not providing funding towards their maintenance. These improvements now mean that many of those who had previously been disqualified for payment under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme because they were in residential care are now entitled to payment under the scheme. Nevertheless, based on the limited data available it is estimated there are still in the region of 4,000 to 5,000 people with disabilities in residential care who are not entitled to disability allowance. The cost of abolishing the residency rule for this group is estimated to be approximately £25 million or 32 million per annum. Despite the recent improvements, it is recognised that more needs to be done. The potential for further improvements in this area is being examined in a budgetary context in the light of the available resources and having regard to the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <P>The possibility of introducing a payment for periods of parental leave, including the question of whether such a payment should be made by employers or in the form of a social welfare payment, is currently being examined by the working group which has been established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to review the operation of the Parental Leave Act, 1998. This group is being chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and comprises representatives from each of the pillars of social partnership, together with representatives of relevant Government Departments and agencies, including my own Department. It is expected that the group will complete its deliberations shortly and its recommendations will be considered by the Government in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The report, Supporting Parenting: a Study of Parents' Support Needs, was undertaken by the Centre for Social and Educational Research in the Dublin Institute of Technology, Rathmines under my Department's families research programme I established in 1999 to support innovative, original research in the field of family policy and family services. The study has only recently been finalised and submitted to my Department. It is being prepared for publication and I propose to officially launch it on 27 November, after which date it will be widely circulated to members of the Oireachtas, policy makers, Departments, the social partners, interest groups and voluntary and community groups with an interest in family matters.</P>
      <P>The study involved 1000 parents, 800 mothers and 200 fathers, with diverse economic, social and family backgrounds. A number of focus groups with children were conducted as part of the study. The result is a comprehensive and in-depth study of parents' perspectives on their parenting role and the supports available to them within their own family network, in their local community environment and through family support services such as antenatal classes, public health nurses, local family and community resource centres and other community supports. The study contains analyses of the interest shown by parents in parenting education and classes, the factors which influence them in their parenting styles, their concerns about the physical and parental care of their children and both parents' and children's views about the enjoyable aspects of parenting relationships. The principal concerns identified by parents related to child safety, speedy access to medical services and access to quality child care. Of the parents surveyed 142 were concerned about being able to provide enough food for their children. The study points to the correlation between this concern and living on low income.</P>
      <P>The parents surveyed identified a wide range of supports for themselves and their children. These include play, leisure and recreation facilities, financial support with childcare expenses and for stay-at-home parents and additional support with day-to-day expenses for parents on lower incomes to assist with school costs and to facilitate parents' involvement in education and training. Access to childcare and after-school care and appropriate services for lone mothers with very young children as well as better access to information about what is available were also identified as important parenting supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> The report makes a number of recommendations for improved service planning and delivery for parents based on the conclusions of the study. The establishment of the Family Support Agency is highlighted as providing a key mechanism to respond to the challenges of providing co-ordinated responses to the varied nature of families' support needs. Many of the issues raised by parents surveyed in the study have been singled out for attention as part of the Government's Families First approach designed to make the promotion of family well-being central to policy. Investment in child benefit is a priority for this Government as a means of easing the financial costs of rearing children. Record increases in child benefit rates over the past two years and planned for next year will bring expenditure to over £900 million or 1.14 billion in 2001 and to £1.5 billion or 1.9 billion in a full year by 2003.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements in the family income supplement scheme together with improvements in basic personal tax allowances have particularly benefited families rearing children on low wages. There have been major improvements in the one-parent family payment scheme, in childcare provision and in access for lone parents to training and employment opportunities. The Family Resource Centre programme has been radically expanded from ten centres in 1997 to 75 centres either up and running or approved for inclusion in the programme. There has been record investment in marriage and family counselling services, in the introduction of a nationwide family mediation service and in the development of improved information services for families.</P>
    <P>The findings of the study, Supporting Parenting: a Study of Parents' Support Needs, will contribute to the further development of these services in line with Government commitments and particularly in the context of the development of the responsibilities of the new Family Support Agency.</P>

      <Quest>if he has plans to reform the criteria for citizens signing on the live register for credits to eliminate restrictions on women returning to the workforce following a period of caring full-time for their children.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>Access to the live register is available to both men and women who satisfy the conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance or who are entitled to sign for unemployment credited contributions, or credits. In order to qualify for social insurance credits a person must have previously worked and paid PRSI; if a person has no PRSI contributions paid or credited for more than two full contribution years, they must return to work and pay PRSI contributions for at least <Col N="1023" /> 26 weeks; and as credits are linked to specific circumstances such as illness or unemployment, a person must provide relevant evidence of these circumstances. For example, a person claiming credits on the basis of unemployment would be required to meet certain criteria, such as showing their availability for work.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of social welfare credits is to secure the PRSI entitlements of insured workers who are temporarily outside the paid workforce for reasons such as unemployment or illness in a manner which is consistent with the continued viability of the social insurance fund. Given that the award of credits can give entitlement to a range of social insurance benefits provided that a certain number of paid contributions have been made, I am sure you will appreciate that it is necessary to have some limitations on such award.</P>
      <P>As regards the use of the live register as a means of facilitating the re-entry of women to the workforce, I should point out that the P2000 working group, which reported in April 2000, considered this question. The group concluded that the best approach did not lie in widening access to the live register itself, but rather in the consideration of alternative direct access routes to education, training and employment programmes for the women concerned. The group also considered that different categories of women had different needs and faced access barriers particular to their individual circumstances. In this regard, the group recommended that access to labour market programmes should be extended to the qualified adults among persons who are eligible to participate in labour market programmes. The two principal labour market schemes administered by this Department, the back to work allowance and the back to education allowance, are available to this category. The group did not recommend the extension of these schemes to the other two reference categories, i.e. spouses in low-income households or returners or entrants who have been outside the labour force engaged in domestic duties or caring full-time for their children. A review of progress to date in implementing the recommendations is being carried out under the aegis of my Department in conjunction with the other relevant Government Departments and agencies and the social partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The dispute in the <Col N="1024" /> Department's office in Letterkenny arose initially out of the filling of three additional temporary posts in the office by the recruitment of staff on short-term contracts. The staff are required for a limited period for work associated with the introduction of a new system for the delivery of child benefit from that office. In addition to child benefit the office also administers treatment benefit, which comprises dental and optical benefits and medical appliances. The industrial action, which involves 157 clerical staff, commenced on 2 October 2001 with a ban on dealing with telephone and fax enquiries and a withdrawal of availability for overtime working. The action was extended on 30 October 2001 to include a ban on a range of other tasks and withdrawal of co-operation with the new service delivery project. While the industrial action is preventing people from making telephone and fax enquiries in relation to entitlements I would emphasise that claims continue to be processed and payments continue to be made to all recipients.</P>
      <P>I regret the inconvenience to the public arising as a result of the industrial action. Every effort is being made to resolve the dispute within the context of existing industrial relations agreements. These agreements already provide for the recruitment of temporary staff in certain circumstances and also provide an agreed mechanism for resolving disputes that may arise in relation to temporary recruitment. This mechanism involves the discussion of the matter at a special monitoring group which can involve a facilitator at the request of either side. My Department is happy to have the issue resolved in this way and has so informed the union. However, contact between the Department and the union is ongoing with a view to resolving the dispute.</P>

The working group was established under the <Col N="1025" /> terms of the PPF and was asked to examine the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments. The group was also required to examine the issue of relative income poverty. The report is a comprehensive account of the many complex issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of welfare payments and will represent a valuable input to policy development in this area for the future. The findings and recommendations contained in the report will also receive careful consideration in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <Quest>the number of social welfare recipients who will not be paid increases as planned from the beginning of January 2002; the reason the increases will not be paid on schedule; when the arrears of payments will be made; the anticipated average payment to be made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The budget announcement for 2002 will take place on 5 December 2001. From next year the income tax year and calendar year will be the same, commencing on 1 January. Tax changes will apply from the beginning of January while increases in social welfare weekly payments will be payable from the pay day in January 2002.</P>
      <P>When this Government came into office in 1997, budget increases in weekly social welfare payments were payable for 29 weeks, that is, from early June. Child benefit increases were payable for three months, that is, from September. Over the last four years I have ensured that social welfare recipients receive their Budget increases earlier. For example, this year's increases in weekly payments were payable for 39 weeks, i.e. from the first week in April, in line with changes in the tax code. Child benefit increases became effective three months earlier, that is, from June 2001. Some 270,000 short-term recipients, mainly unemployment and illness recipients and supplementary welfare recipients, are paid weekly by cheque and electronic forms of payment via the integrated short-term scheme computer system. Budget increase payments to 99% &ndash; 267,500 &ndash; of these customers will be made on time, while the remaining 1% &ndash; 2,500 customers &ndash; will receive the bulk of their increase on time with a small balancing arrears payment to follow in February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Book-based payment systems, which are the chosen payment option for the majority of pensioners and other long-term beneficiaries, are less flexible than other payment methods and require longer lead-times to implement increases. Around 623,000 social welfare customers receive their payment by means of pension order books <Col N="1026" /> and all of these books are currently in payment and in the possession of those customers. For four of the schemes involved, representing about 20,000 beneficiaries, it will be possible to pay the budget increases on time in January. These schemes are family income supplement, disability benefit, rent allowance and carer's benefit. In the case of the other book-paid schemes, which represent around 600,000 beneficiaries, the currency of the orders in the books runs into next year and the orders carry values based on the rates now applying. It is not physically possible to recall all these books and print new ones with the new rates and have them back with customers for cashing between 5 December 2001 and 1 January 2002, a period of less than four weeks.</P>
    <P>My Department has examined all possible options to ensure that the payment of the new rates is done as quickly as possible and as close as can be to the date on which they are due and the proposed arrangements are the best response possible in the time available. A lump sum payment will be included in the first order in the new books for 210,000 customers in early February 2002. A further 393,000 who are not due to get new books until April 2002 will receive a special single order book in mid-February 2002 containing arrears for six weeks and an advance payment for seven weeks to bring them up to the date on which their new books arrive. This means all beneficiaries will be in receipt of payments at the new rates from the middle of February at latest. As the budgetary rates are not decided it is not possible to give examples of the amounts involved in those cases where arrears will be payable.</P>

      <P>The bereavement grant, formerly the death grant, is a payment based on PRSI contributions, designed to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses. The grant is payable on the death of: an insured person; the wife or husband of an insured person; the widow or widower of an insured person; a child under age 18, or under age 22 if in full-time education, where either parent or the person that the child normally lives with satisfies the PRSI contribution conditions; a contributory pensioner; the wife or husband of a contributory pensioner; the qualified adult of a contributory pensioner, including those who would be a qualified adult but are getting another social welfare payment, for example, carer's allowance; a qualified child; an orphan in receipt of orphan's contributory allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bereavement grant was totally redesigned in 1999 to provide for a five-fold increase in the <Col N="1027" /> rate of payment from £100 or 127 to the current rate of £500 or 635. In addition, the payment was extended to include self-employed PRSI contributors and those covered by the modified rate of social insurance in addition to those paying full-rate PRSI contributions. A person who has insufficient PRSI contributions will not qualify for a bereavement grant. However, there are other measures in place that are designed to assist people in the immediate aftermath of bereavement, for example, the payment of six weeks' social welfare following the death of certain social welfare recipients or their spouse. In addition, under the supplementary welfare allowance, a health board may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off exceptional expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his/her weekly income. These payments, known as exceptional needs payments, may be made towards funeral expenses where it is established that there is an inability to meet the costs by the family concerned. The current arrangements are kept under review in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The United Nations human development report represents a useful contribution to our knowledge on human development both globally and in Ireland. However, as a result of the methodology employed by the UN the human poverty index contained in the report does not accurately reflect the results of other research conducted in relation to poverty levels in Ireland. Results from the 1998 Living in Ireland survey conducted by the ESRI show that the numbers affected by consistent poverty are down to 6-8% of the population and it can be expected that further improvements will emerge when the results from the 2000 wave of the survey come to hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures demonstrate that real progress is being made in tackling poverty and in achieving the target set by this Government of reducing the level of consistent poverty to below 5% by 2004. The weightings ascribed in the calculation by the UN of its human poverty index place particular emphasis on functional illiteracy scores. In this regard, a report on the international adult literacy survey, or IALS, from the Department of Education and Science stated that interpretation of IALS results as revealing a high level of illiteracy <Col N="1028" /> in the Irish population was unwarranted and that the assessment was not designed to address the issue of illiteracy at all; the level of difficulty and complexity of tasks assumed that the vast majority of the population were literate.</P>
    <P>The Government is however very conscious of the need to tackle issues of illiteracy and £73.6 million has been provided under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to ensure progress in this area. It is anticipated that upwards of 113,000 people will participate in the adult literacy strategy programme by the end of the plan. While Ireland's position on the index is primarily influenced by the figure for functional illiteracy, Ireland's score on the Index would have been better if more recent and timely data had been used. For example, the index features an unemployment rate of 5.6% from 1997 while last year's UNHDP report used the lower 1998 figure of 4.4% and the unemployment rate has fallen further since then. In addition, the Index suggests that life expectancy rates fell between 1998 and 1999 but the latest information from the Central Statistics Office, Population and Labour Force Projections, 2001-2031, published in 1999, indicate a continuing, steady increase in Irish life expectancy rates. The UN human development report is a useful learning tool but given the rapid rate of change we have experienced over recent years it is important that debate and policy formulation is informed by the most accurate and up to date information available.</P>

    <P>It should also be noted that Údarás na Gaeltachta, under the remit of the Department of the Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, has responsibility for the industrial development in Gaeltacht areas, including Connemara and parts of Claregalway. In relation to Tuam specifically, there are three IDA Ireland assisted companies, Transitions Optical, Pulse Engineering and Logstrup, which employed a total of 300 staff between them at the end of 2000. While Pulse Engineering has scaled down its operations in Tuam due to a rationalisation of global operations involving the integration of its European business group into Guildford in the UK and the divesting of its manufacturing organisation involving 56 employees, the company is committed to the retention of its design centre in Tuam. Transition Optical has continued to expand in Tuam in recent years. In September 1997, it announced an expansion creating an additional 75 jobs and in April 1999 it announced an investment of a further IR£14 million in another expansion of its European photochromic plastic spec<Col N="1030" /> tacle lenses manufacturing facility, which created an additional 115 jobs.</P>
    <P>Employment in Logstrup has also continued to rise from 35 in 1994 to 63 in 2000. IDA Ireland approved a further investment in the company in October 2000. In line with IDA Ireland's strategy of intensifying its focus on the Objective One region, the agency continues to promote Tuam for activities such as healthcare, medical devices, engineering-electronics etc. The agency is also committed to achieving a better distribution of new overseas projects outside the major population centres and to upgrading the quality of jobs in overseas companies by encouraging additional functions and deepening existing functions. Enterprise Ireland works with indigenous industry and with local promoters, and consequently does not tend to have an influence on where new projects may be located. However, the agency's west regional office continues to work with and provide advice and support to local groups such as Action Tuam, with the view to ensuring projects can be developed. There are a number of Enterprise Ireland assisted companies in Tuam which employed a total of 829 people at the end of 2000. These include Connaught Electronics, Home Lee Bedding, Conveyors and Packaging, Larkin Engineering and JFC Manufacturing Limited.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is responding to the changing economic environment and the challenges facing its clients in a number of ways to help them adjust to the changing circumstances. These include enhanced international marketing efforts, the development of a network of venture capital funds, monitoring and improving the sub-supply sector, improving competitiveness, client support services, identification of diversification opportunities and the development of strategies to deal with lower cost challenges. The industrial development agencies are also active in the provision of suitable industrial property solutions. Enterprise Ireland supports the Action Tuam run enterprise centre in Tuam, which was set up in 1990 and now employs approximately 75 people in the centre and a further 300 plus within the immediate area.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland has acquired a 27.5 acre site at Dunmore Road, Tuam, for development as a new business park. Site development works are due to commence within three weeks, to be followed by proposals from private developers for the construction of the first 26,000 square foot advance building, for which planning permission has already been granted. I am confident the measures outlined above which are currently being adopted by the industrial development agencies, as well as the continuing commitment of the Government to regional development will bring further positive results to Tuam.</P>

      <P>Ministerial responsibility for the mining industry comes within the remit of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. On 1 November 2001, Outokumpu Oyj., the Finnish Company which owns the Tara zinc mine, announced that it was placing the mine on a care and maintenance basis. Consequently, all of its approximately 670 employees were on that day issued with protective notice of temporary layoffs, to take effect from 17 November 2001. About 50 staff are expected to remain to maintain essential services. The downturn in global economic conditions and the resulting low base metal prices were cited by the company as the reason for its decision. The company said it will review the situation on an ongoing basis, and that operations will resume as soon as market conditions allow the mine to become viable.</P>
      <P>Since the announcement, FÁS has been in contact with the company and has offered its services to both the company and the workers to assist them at this time. A meeting between FÁS and the company for the purpose of agreeing specific measures of support and assistance is scheduled to take place today, Wednesday, 7 November. The company has, however, expressed concern to FÁS about people being available to return to work, and wishes to emphasise that the proposed layoff is temporary. The industrial development agencies continue to actively promote the Navan area as a location for investment. FÁS and the other agencies will maintain close contact to minimise the effect of the layoffs.</P>

      <P>The Central Fisheries Board carried out a fishery survey of the Castlebar River, Lough Cullin and Lough Conn in 2001 at the request of the North-Western Regional Fisheries Board. The comprehensive reports of the survey are not yet available. However, the central board informs me that an initial review of the data allows it to make the following comments.</P>
      <P>The lower reaches of the Castlebar River are badly polluted and support very poor stocks of salmonoids relative to other clean channels in the Moy catchment; the phosphorous load from the Castlebar River has created eutrophic conditions in Lough Cullin periodically and is also probably contributing to the eutrophication problem in Lough Conn; and the decline of Lough Cullin as a trout angling fishery is both directly and indirectly related to the polluted nature of the Castlebar River.</P>
      <P>The north-western board informs me that, in accordance with its statutory duty to protect inland fisheries, it has appealed against a proposed new sewerage scheme for Castlebar on the grounds that the proposed scheme will involve the continued discharge of treated effluent into the Castlebar River. The central and north west regional fishery boards concur that the appropriate longterm solution is the re-routing of treated sewage from Castlebar to an outfall in Clew Bay which in their considered view would not adversely impact on water quality in the Bay. The matter is now for decision by An Bord Pleanála in the light of all the relevant factors and submissions.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the maintenance and development of Dungarvan Harbour lies with the local authority in the first instance. A feasibility study on the development of the harbour was forwarded to my Department by the Urban District Council in 1998. This study focused primarily on developing the harbour to service marine tourism and leisure facilities. The marine tourism grant scheme is one of five sub-measures of the overall tourism measure of the national development plan and is currently being prepared by my Department in consultation with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation which has responsibility for the implementation of the overall measure. Until the scheme is launched and formal application forms and guidelines are available, applications cannot be accepted. However, all parties who have expressed an interest in the scheme will be sent details and an application form as soon as they are available.</P>
      <P>Once the grant scheme is in place and a formal application received from the promoters of these projects, they will be assessed in accordance with the procedures laid down under the scheme. In March 2001 my Department received from the Urban District Council an updated report on urgently required remedial works to the quay wall at Davitt's Quay. My Department has allocated funding of £120,000 for these repair works in the current year costing a total of £160,000.</P>

This objective is central to Ireland's efforts in support of an effective response to the humanitarian emergency in Afghanistan, including its impact on neighbouring countries. At UN level, the related issues of refugees and opening borders have been raised with both the Pakistani and Iranian Governments by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Ruud Lubbers, during his recent working visit to their respective capitals.</P>
      <P>Before the 11 September terrorist attacks on the US, there were already more than three million Afghan refugees in bordering countries, mainly Pakistan and Iran. The enormous movement of refugees which had been anticipated following the attacks has not yet materialised. Most persons displaced from their homes have, so far, stayed within the country. There are estimated to be 1.3 million people in this category of &lsquo;internally displaced persons'. The UN and international aid agencies have identified their presence at 229 locations which are being mapped for humanitarian aid purposes. Latest UN estimates for the number of Afghans who have fled into neighbouring countries following 11 September stand at around 85,000 for Pakistan and 20,000 for Iran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN High Commission for Refugees has to respond to both existing and potential refugee needs and is making the necessary preparations to cater for any worsening of the refugee situation. These preparations are being made in terms of providing secure, serviced accommodation in existing locations and of establishing additional refugee camps, as necessary. While some neighbouring countries favour the siting of camps just inside the Afghan border, UNHCR is opposed to this as it leaves refugees vulnerable to military recruitment, forced labour or other forms of exploitation. The Government strongly supports the UNHCR position and wishes to see all refugees allowed to exercise their rights freely, including the freedom to cross borders, in accordance with international humanitarian law. The £4 million, 5.08 million, provided by Ireland in humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan this year is balanced in its delivery between those at risk within the country and those who are seeking protection in neighbouring states such as Pakistan and Iran. This is being provided through Irish NGOs such as Concern, Trócaire, GOAL and Christian Aid, and through the appropriate UN and International Red Cross and Crescent agencies who <Col N="1037" /> have the necessary working access to get aid to those most in need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1999 and with the assistance of EU and Exchequer funding under the national development plan, Dublin Bus has purchased 275 additional buses to expand the fleet and a further 156 buses to replace older and more inefficient buses. Taking into account the new buses and subcontracting, the bus fleet has increased by more than 25% in a short period of time. Along with the increase in capacity, the quality and frequency of bus services has increased. The provision and allocation of bus services is the responsibility of the management of Dublin Bus. However, I understand that Dublin Bus is monitoring and reviewing its services with regard to the port tunnel construction and has already introduced a further five additional buses at peak times on the Whitehall corridor in anticipation of the general traffic problems that would occur. I also understand the company will continue to monitor the situation and respond accordingly.</P>
      <P>With regard to the quality bus corridors, this is a matter for my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The introduction of QBCs has generally been considered to be a success and I understand that QBCs are now in operation in respect of Malahide, Lucan, Stillorgan, Finglas, North Clondalkin, Rathfarnham, Tallaght, Blanchardstown and the City Centre to the Airport. Data available in respect of QBCs suggest that their introduction has cut bus journey times in some cases by up to 40%. In the case of the Stillorgan QBC, it has been demonstrated that buses can attract people out of private cars, with peak period passenger numbers up by 150%. I have been informed by Dublin Bus that it works continuously with Dublin Corporation to improve the performance of the QBCs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am totally focused on the task of securing the future of Aer Lingus with as many sustainable jobs as possible. The first step in that process is implementing the survival plan. Aer Lingus indicated last week that through the sale of aircraft and borrowings, £40 million will be made available to fund a redundancy programme which is a vital component of the survival plan. The company advises that this is the absolute <Col N="1039" /> maximum it can afford if the airline is to have any prospect of surviving. Union representatives and members were advised last week of the proposals and detailed information was issued to all staff on Monday, 5 November 2001. I understand that engagement has commenced between management and unions on all aspects of the survival plan. In addition, it is clear that access by Aer Lingus to external funds would greatly support the company's survival plan, particularly in order to strengthen its balance sheet.</P>
      <P>That is why the Government, taking account of the EU position, has decided in principle that, provided the survival plan is rapidly agreed and implemented in all its essential aspects, it will facilitate private sector interests in an investment in Aer Lingus to provide a source of funding to support the plan. The Government also decided that it should be open to the staff of Aer Lingus to also invest further in the airline. The Government has made no decision as to the size of shareholding which could be the subject of an investment by the private sector. Specifically in relation to the events of 11 September and the horizontal emergency aid agreed by the Transport Council on 16 October for all European airlines, my Department has written to Irish airlines outlining the basis for compensation and the criteria to be used in applying for such compensation. Obviously, Aer Lingus will be a major beneficiary as it is the only Irish airline operating on the transatlantic route. However, such compensation will result in a relatively small amount of cash for Aer Lingus in the context of the current crisis.</P>
      <P>I still believe the compensation measures for all airlines for the four-day closure of US airspace is minimalist and insufficient given the impact of the terrorist attacks, particularly when one takes account of the US aid package. I will continue to press for an extension of this measure. On the bigger question of investment in Aer Lingus, my officials are staying in contact with the European Commission. Last week, the Taoiseach and I met representatives of ICTU for a discussion on the Aer Lingus survival plan and the urgency of its implementation. The national implementation body of the PPF has also met ICTU on a number of occasions in the matter. I have also had three recent meetings with the central representative committee of the Aer Lingus unions. We have a difficult and urgent task. I want to get on with that task to ensure the survival of this company.</P>

      <P>The holding of the person in question has been restricted since July 2000 when five brucellosis reactors were disclosed at the annual round test. Two further reactors were disclosed at subsequent tests, the latest in February 2001. The herd has since undergone four clear tests. The situation in regard to this holding is exacerbated by the fact that it is contiguous to land rented by a dealer, whose home herd was depopulated due to brucellosis in October 2000. Two further herds contiguous to the dealer's home herd were subsequently depopulated and three more are awaiting depopulation. In view of this difficult disease situation all herds adjacent to the land rented by the dealer were included in an expanded brucellosis contiguous testing programme.</P>
      <P>Although, as already indicated, the herd in question has tested negative at 4 consecutive tests, veterinary opinion is that infection could be latent in the herd and that it would not be prudent to de-restrict it until a further calving cycle has elapsed. As most of the animals in the herd are female, they cannot be allowed to be sold on the open market because of the risk of spreading infection. In accordance with normal practice in such circumstances, it is not proposed to return the passports/cattle identity cards to the herdowner in question at this stage. However, animals suitable for slaughter may be moved under permit to a meat factory.</P>

      <Quest>the environmental reason for imposing the condition under the new REP scheme that a farmer participating in the REP scheme must ensure that the amount of chemical nitrogen used is not greater than the organic nitrogen spread; and if he will consider allowing an exemption for existing REP scheme participants who do not keep livestock and whose main farm enterprise is growing hay and silage for sale and who wish to enter into a further REP scheme contract when their initial contract expires.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under measure 1 of the REP scheme, each participant is required to follow a nutrient management plan. The objective of a nutrient management plan is the more efficient use of nitrogen and phosphorous to ensure that a proper balance is achieved between the level of nutrient application and crop requirements. Organic nitrogen is a valuable resource and its proper management results in a controlled recycling of organic wastes and reduced dependency on chemical nitrogen in crop production. Achieving a proper balance between nitrogen inputs and crop requirements contributes to environmental sustainability. REP scheme farms with low organic nitrogen availability have a low stocking density. To maintain these stocking levels there is no need to use levels of chemical nitrogen above the levels of organic nitrogen applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be difficult, if not impossible, on environmental grounds to justify a REP scheme payment in a situation where the organic nitrogen potential of a crop produced is disregarded in the nutrient management plan. REP scheme participants whose main farm enterprise is the growing of hay and silage for sale are in effect net exporters of organic nitrogen. Nationally there is a surplus of organic nitrogen, particularly on pig farms, which needs to be recycled. Therefore the REP scheme, as an agri-environment scheme, requires farmers whose main farm enterprise is the growing of hay and silage for sale to import organic nitrogen to compensate for the organic nutrients exported, thus contributing to the environmental management of organic waste. Existing REP scheme contracts will be adhered to, but all new five-year contracts under REPS 2000 must adhere to the requirement that the maximum level of chemical nitrogen can never exceed the planned level of organic nitrogen to be applied. The importation of organic nutrients <Col N="1043" /> from other farms is permitted under the scheme and should where appropriate be provided for in the agri-environmental plan.</P>

      <P>The general principle applying to changeover costs is that they are borne by the sectors on which they fall, and this includes the financial institutions. The State and its institutions are of course bearing significant costs themselves, including the changeover costs of the public sector; the cost of the public information and business information campaigns run by the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland and Forfás respectively; and the Central Bank's costs as regards production and distribution of euro notes and coins and withdrawal of Irish pound notes. I would also mention coins; and the cost of the agreement with the banks, which I announced in the Dáil on 8 May 2001, whereby they will not charge cash handling charges on euro cash provided to retailers in advance of 1 January 2002 and will not charge cash lodgement charges on IR£ cash lodged by retailers during the dual circulation period and for a week afterwards. This agreement, aimed at facilitating the cash changeover, will partly, but only partly, compensate the banks for the fee income they will forgo and will cost an estimated £5 million to £6 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the Government's policy in introducing the new regime for taxi licences, section 51 of the Finance Act, 2001, provided for a new scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the cost of taxi licences acquired on or before 21 November 2000. The allowances are effectively backdated with the cost being deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 where the licence was purchased prior to that date. It is <Col N="1046" /> understood that from the details supplied by the Deputy that he is referring to a case involving a person who has five taxi licences. This case was the subject of a previous Parliamentary Question put down by the Deputy on 22 May last &ndash; PQ No. 14663/01.</P>
      <P>The situation as set out in my reply to that question still stands. In brief, the person may claim capital allowances in respect of one of the five licences only but if he wishes to transfer his own existing taxi trade from the least expensive licence to a more expensive one in order to maximise the relief available he may do so. However, where this happens the capital allowances for the years leading up to the transfer are deemed to have been made already in previous years so that only the balance of the allowances for the subsequent years would then be available in respect of the more expensive licence. As I indicated previously, the individual in question may clarify his position by contacting the direct taxes administration division of the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin Castle at telephone number 6748017.</P>

      <P>There is no specific licensing or certification procedure in place at the moment for persons offering psychological therapy.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to the Deputy's Parliamentary Question <Col N="1051" /> No. 324 of 16 October 2001, the information supplied by e-mail is now put on record and refers to data on public hospital procedures as derived from the hospital in-patient enquiry system. HIPE collects data relating to all discharges from publicly funded acute hospitals and records up to four procedures for each episode of care.</P>
      <P>Identification of the consultant who performed the procedure is not possible from the HIPE data, but a major diagnostic category based on principal clinical area is assigned to each hospital discharge as part of the Casemix classification system. Using this classification cases can be categorised as either surgical or medical and assigned to an appropriate MDC.</P>
      <P>The data set out in the table records the number of surgical cases by MDC for each hospital sub-divided into public and private cases for the year 2000. In this instance, public/private status refers to the status of the patient with respect to the consultant rather than to the type of bed occupied. Totals by hospital and nationally are also reported. In order to comply with confidentiality protocols, small numbers of cases occurring in a given sub-category are reported as &lt;5.</P>
      <P>The figures refer to inpatients and day cases and show that approximately 70% of surgery cases relate to public patients and 30% to private patients. Overall, surgical cases account for 22% of all cases. Further analysis shows that private inpatient treatment is more likely to be elective, 40% for private, 29% for public, and that 72% of private surgical cases are elective, 64% for public cases. In addition, average lengths of stay are consistently lower for private surgical patients, 6.4 days, than for public surgical patients, 7.4 days. This results in 72% of surgical bed-days attributable to public patients and 28% to private patients.</P>
      <P>HIPE is the only multi-hospital system which records diagnostic and procedural information on each acute hospital discharge. The identity of individual consultants is not included on the HIPE system. This is also true of HIPE information available to health boards through the national system.</P>
      <P>More generally, as I indicated in a reply to the Deputy to Questions Nos. 321 and 353 of 16 October 2001, I am not satisfied with the degree of transparency attaching to the public/private mix in hospitals. This is one of the issues to be addressed in moving to a more equitable and patient centred health system in the forthcoming health strategy.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority that the process of transferring 30 residents from St. Joseph's intellectual disability services, Portrane, to the new facility in Clonmethan is ongoing. The Northern Area Health Board expects to submit an application for planning shortly in respect of the new residential and day facilities on the St. Ita's campus for a further 60 persons. It was essential that an overall control plan was developed for the campus as a whole before decisions could be taken in relation to the siting of the new facilities for the St. Joseph's services. While detailed work was ongoing in relation to the brief for the project during this time, definitive plans and costings in relation to the facilities could not be completed until this process had been finalised.</P>
      <P>A site has been sourced in Lusk for the development of a complex similar to Clonmethan which would accommodate a further 30 residents from the St. Joseph's services. As part of the national development plan proposals, the provision of additional accommodation for a further 30 residents on the grounds of St. Brendan's Hospital is also planned.</P>
      <P>In addition the authority have informed me that over £1 million &ndash; 1.27 million &ndash; in capital funding was invested in existing facilities in St. Joseph's intellectual disability services between 2000 and 2001 to improve infrastructure, services and facilities for residents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that my Department is working closely with the authority and the North<Col N="1053" /> ern Area Health Board in relation to developments for St. Joseph's services with a view to moving these developments forward as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any circumstances where persons are automatically screened for diseases or medical conditions without their consent. However, anonymous unlinked antenatal testing for HIV has been in place in Ireland since 1992. Tests are carried out on blood specimens routinely collected for rubella serology from pregnant women who book into the antenatal clinics. No identifying information is recorded and the residual serum is therefore unlinked and anonymous. The objectives of HIV surveillance are to obtain information on the incidence and preva<Col N="1055" /> lence of HIV in specific population groups in a manner that is as free as possible from bias, and to look at the determinants of the spread of infection in those groups.</P>
      <P>Since 1999 an antenatal linked testing programme for HIV has commenced. Consent must be sought from a woman prior to this test being carried out. The two programmes are running concurrently until there is an uptake rate of at least 90% of the linked programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children does not routinely collect statistics on the number of applicants to provide foster care. As the Deputy will be aware, the foster care regulations oblige health boards to establish and maintain one or more panels of persons who will act as foster carers. They specify a number of conditions that need to be met, including written medical reports, two referees, authorisations to obtain Garda clearance, and assessment as to their suitability and their homes' suitability for the placement of foster children.</P>
      <P>There have been concerns expressed about the recruitment and retention of foster carers by those involved in the foster care service. Recommendations have been made in the report of the working group on foster care to address these concerns, and the Government is committed in principle to implementing the recommendations of the Report on a phased basis. It should also be noted that health boards are undertaking local initiatives on the recruitment of foster carers. These initiatives include prominent displays of promotional materials, advertisements in local media and sponsorship of events organised in conjunction with the Irish Foster Care Association.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Health boards have over the years provided a level of support, either directly or through specialist voluntary agencies, for children with disabilities. These services include diagnosis, assessment, pre-school and out-reach support for children of school going age. However in recent <Col N="1058" /> years there has been both an increased demand for such services and an expanding range of educational placements.</P>
      <P>Between 1998 and 2000 additional funding amounting to £5 million, 6.35 euro, was allocated specifically to enhance the level of health related support services available to children with autism. A further £3.5 million, 4.44 euro, was allocated this year for these services for both children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. In addition to this ringfenced funding, children with disabilities would also have benefited from the additional therapy posts which have been put in place in services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>Many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives both at home and abroad. My Department has also asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services.</P>
      <P>In response to my concern regarding current severe labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists. The study, a comprehensive assessment of workforce requirement for qualified personnel in these areas to 2015, was published on 25 July last.</P>
      <P>The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places each for speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. Other key recommendations of the report includes &ndash; provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; career structure, workload, working practices and skill mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professionals, published April 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an <Col N="1059" /> urgent priority. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study.</P>
    <P>With reference to your request for information regarding the services for a particular school in Dublin 5, responsibility for the provision of services to this school rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>As I advised the Deputy on 11 October 2001, the Western Health Board was allocated a sum of £1 million, 1.27 million, this year for the development of symptomatic breast disease services in line with the recommendations of the Report of the Sub-Group on the Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease. The board has formulated detailed proposals for the development of services in its functional area, including services at Mayo General Hospital. These proposals have been the subject of extensive consultations between my Department and the board and my Department will be responding to the board shortly. I assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with the board to ensure a comprehensive and coherent approach to the development of symptomatic breast disease services in the region.</P>

      <P>The national development plan sets out, <i>inter alia</i>, a strategic framework for the development of the national roads network over the coming seven years. It is a matter for the National Roads Authority, within the NDP framework, to promote detailed programming of the work required and to manage, in co-operation with local authorities, the planning, design and implementation of individual road development projects.</P>
      <P>As part of its July 2001 presentation to the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure regarding progress on the delivery of the road infrastructure projects mandated in the national development plan, the National Roads Authority reported on improvements to routes serving the North-West. The NRA has undertaken to conduct a more detailed assessment of N5 improvements and to report further on this at their next presentation to the Cabinet Committee in December 2001.</P>
      <P>In reply to Question No. 267 of 19 June 2001, I indicated that section 17 of the Roads Act, 1993, assigns overall responsibility to the National Roads Authority for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads. Consistently with this position, successive Ministers for the Department of the Environment and Local Government have not exercised any role in relation to the implementation of individual national road schemes. It remains the case that I have not issued any instruction to the National Roads Authority in relation to the N5 or any other route.</P>

A total of 918 housing starts have been approved for Waterford City and County for the four years 2000-03. This includes an additional allocation of 140 starts from the 3,000 additional starts announced in Action on Housing for the period 2000-03.</P>

Numbers awaiting a test have risen in Waterford City because of an above average increase of 16% in applications in 2001 compared to 2000 and accommodation constraints in the original test centre. My Department is now in a position to schedule additional testers to reduce the numbers waiting for a test. Average waiting times for a test in Waterford City and Dungarvan at the 2 November 2001 are 15 and 13 weeks respectively.</P>

      <P>Under the European Communities <Col N="1065" /> (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 2001, the theory test certificate issued by the Driver Theory Testing Service must specify the candidates Personal Public Service Number, PPSN. For this reason and to facilitate the proper identification of applicants, the PPSN is required to be provided on application for a driver theory test, subject of course to the protection of privacy, provided for in the Data Protection Act, 1988, and the Social Welfare Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>The requirement to provide the PPSN in such cases is in keeping with the integrated social services strategy adopted by the Government in 1996, which recommended the extension of the use of the RSI number across the public service in the interests of improving customer service. The Social Welfare Act, 1998, gave legal effect to this recommendation, renaming the RSI number as the personal public service number while also providing safeguards for the protection of the customer's right to privacy.</P>
      <P>To connect public services, a common unique personal identification number is needed. For many years, the revenue and social insurance number was a common identification number for taxation and social welfare purposes. Reach, the agency established by the Irish Government to develop a strategy for the integration of public services and to develop and implement a framework for electronic government, sees use of the PPSN gradually being extended beyond the taxation and welfare domains. It is already in use in the health area and is now being extended to the education and local authority sectors.</P>

This report will be considered as part of the existing examination of the issue of eligibility that is tak<Col N="1066" /> ing place in the context of the new health strategy that is currently being prepared in my Department.</P>

      <P>The success of the pre-53 pension scheme which I introduced last year has, I am happy to say, far exceeded my expectations. Some 5,000 applications were expected of which about 3,000 would qualify. Since its introduction my Department has received some 22,500 applications for this pension and applications continue to be received at a rate of more than 200 a week. Just over 12,000 or 54% have been decided so far. Of these, some 7,800 people have been awarded a pre-53 pension, i.e., 65% of the applications processed, and pension is in payment in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> Apart from new applicants, the initiative also benefited people already in receipt of a pro-rata old age contributory or retirement pension at lower weekly rates. In 8,500 of these cases the pensioners qualified for a higher rate pre-53 pension which has been put into payment in all cases. As a result the total number benefiting from the new scheme amounts to 16,300 and this will grow as the number of applications on hand are dealt with.</P>
    <P>Everything possible is being done to process these applications quickly. Additional resources have been applied to this work as circumstances and demands on other fronts allow. These applications are however more time consuming than normal applications due to the need to trace old insurance numbers and records and every effort is being made to ensure that applications are not refused wrongly because of shortcomings in this respect. These difficulties are explained to applicants whose co-operation greatly facilitates the progress which is being achieved in processing these applications. The position is being kept under constant review and steps to further improve the situation will be taken where circumstances permit. Delays in processing applications will not result in any losses to pensioners. Those who qualify for payment will have their claims backdated in accordance with the normal provisions.</P>

      <P>Free travel companion passes have been available since 1990 to certain categories of people who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone. This type of pass enables a person aged 16 years or over to accompany the passholder free of charge. The aim of the special companion pass arrangement is to facilitate and encourage disabled people to utilise public transport as they wish, while recognising that they would be unable to do so unless they were accompanied.</P>
      <P>In cases where a passholder is being cared for by a recipient of a carer's allowance the carer is entitled to a standard type free travel pass in their own right. This also applies to nominated carers of recipients of a constant attendance allowance or prescribed relatives allowance, where the carer does not have to be in receipt of a carer's allowance specifically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from this specific arrangement in the case of carers, there are no plans to extend the <Col N="1068" /> companion free travel pass arrangement to allow a designated companion travel free on their own. There are approximately 540,000 clients with a free travel pass. It is not possible to say how many of these passes provide for a companion to accompany the person concerned.</P>

      <P>There are peak time free travel restrictions on free travel services on Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann provincial city services in Cork and Limerick. The restrictions arise because of pressure on bus capacity at peak commuter times. The times involved are 7 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. Monday to Friday inclusive. Restrictions also apply from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Fridays on Bus Éireann long distance services within a 20 mile radius of Dublin, Cork and Limerick. They do not apply to DART or other rail services. These peak-time restrictions have existed since the inception of the scheme and are based on the utilisation of spare off-peak capacity.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that these restrictions can cause difficulties for a small number of passholders who have unavoidably early hospital appointments. In recognition of this my Department, in consultation with CIE, have agreed in a small number of exceptional cases to issue a temporary unrestricted pass for a period of up to six months to allow the passholder to re-arrange appointments outside of the peak times. The approach in these cases is sustainable only as long as it is applied in exceptional circumstances and for the reasons mentioned.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was issued with an unrestricted pass in August 2001 and this will expire at the end of February 2002. In the interim the person concerned is advised to re-arrange his appointments to enable him to travel outside the peak times at that stage.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board pay<Col N="1069" /> ments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5, 6.35, per week is normally paid to eligible households. However, an additional £3, 3.81, per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to £8, 10.16, per week. In the case of a relatively small number of people living in smokeless zones, the £3, 3.81, per week smokeless fuel supplement only is payable. As announced in last year's budget, the fuel season has been increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks. The fuel season was extended by two weeks in April and now also commences one week earlier in October.</P>
      <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates. The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
      <P>In that regard, the increases in primary payments that I introduced in the three budgets since the scheme was reviewed have provided for a substantial real increase after fully compensating for inflation, including fuel price inflation. The increases in primary payments of £8, 10.16, to £10, 12.70, per week that I brought into effect in April of this year are the largest ever implemented.</P>
      <P>Giving people a real increase in their primary payment for 52 weeks of the year is a more expensive option than increasing the fuel allowance payment rate for part of the year. However, I believe it is the correct approach to take as it gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs. Any further changes in the scheme would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in light of alternative proposals for delivering improvements in social welfare supports to pensioners and others.</P>

      <P>The back to work allowance scheme was introduced in September 1993 as part of my Department's programme of initiatives to assist the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force. Since then, almost 80,000 people including long-term unemployed, lone parents, and other social welfare recipients, have availed of the scheme to take up new jobs as either employees or self employed persons. An independent evaluation of the scheme published in December 2000 recommended that it be refocused on the longer term unemployed, and the self-employed, that the non-financial supports be enhanced, and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced. The report found that the scheme was affected by high levels of deadweight in that many of those entering the scheme would have found work without the financial support the scheme provides. Having regard to the report's findings, the qualifying period for participation on the employee strand of the scheme was increased from 12 months to 15 months in April 2001. Persons aged 50 years or over however, who are interested in self-employment, can still avail of the scheme after 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> In relation specifically to the long-term unemployed, persons who are more than five years unemployed may receive weekly travel and meal allowances and bonuses for commencing and remaining in employment. In addition, to assist persons who have been out of work for a long time due to illness, the scheme is available to people in receipt of disability allowance and extended to persons in receipt of disability benefit for five years or more.</P>
    <P>Also in line with the recommendations in the report, a wide range of additional incentives and supports is available under the back to work scheme to those interested in self-employment. These include enhanced assistance towards the cost of business plans, marketing, advertising and small capital items; interest free loans to persons starting or expanding their own businesses from the First Step organisation; loans through the credit union movement which are guaranteed by my Department; special grants to existing self employed customers who take on a long-term unemployed person, and guidance and help with all aspects of their businesses from my Department's jobs facilitators. The Department will continue to monitor the scheme and any further improvements deemed necessary to its further enhancement will be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Family income supplement is designed to provide cash support for employees with families on low earnings and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments. The range of improvements to the family income supplement scheme instituted by this Government, including the assessment of FIS on the basis of net rather than gross income and the progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for lower income households to qualify under the scheme. In April 2001, the income limits were increased by £25, 31.74, at each point, resulting in an average increase of £15, 19.05, per week for all FIS recipients. The question of further improvements to the income thresholds, is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, having regard to available resources and Government commitments.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that it has been a Government priority to invest heavily in the child benefit scheme as a means of easing the financial burden of rearing children. Before this Government came to office, expenditure on child benefit was £397, 504, million annually. Our first three budgets increased this to £575, 730, million, an increase of more than 40%. The very significant increases in child benefit rates provided for in budget 2001, which raised the level for the first two children by £25, 31.74, per month and for the third and subsequent children by £30, 38.09, per month, came into effect in June of this year. Total expenditure on child benefit is now over £900, 1,143, million per year. Moreover, the Government is committed to providing for increases of similar magnitude in the next two budgets, bringing investment in the scheme up to a total of some £1.5, 1.9, billion in a full year by 2003.</P>
      <P>This means that by 2002, we will have exceeded the commitment contained in the programme for prosperity and fairness to move towards child benefit rates of £100 per month for third and subsequent children.</P>

      <Quest>if he has accepted the recommendation of the Data Protection Commissioner that individuals who have high privacy expectations may choose to withhold their personal data and that the provision of public services to a citizen should not be contingent upon the citizen's participation in the Reach data base as quoted in the Annual Report, 2000 of the Data Protection Commissioner.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Reach agency has a mandate to develop a particular service delivery model known as the public services broker. This model is being adopted in the interests of efficiency, economy, speed of deployment and maximising the possibilities for future service and business process integration in the public service. A central feature of the model is that a certain set of services that are common to some or all public service agencies will, in the future, be carried out centrally by the public services broker. The broker will also provide customer data services. These customer data services will include secure personal customer data stores or data vaults under the individual customer's control, referred to as the reach database by the Data Protection Commissioner, in which customers may store commonly used items of data to support their requests for service from public service agencies.</P>
      <P>In line with e-government objectives, public service delivery agencies will, in the future, be required to deliver their services through the broker and to use its common services. There is, however, no requirement that this be the exclusive means by which public services be delivered. If a person does not wish to use the data vault services, he or she will have the option of producing any necessary supporting data or documentation in the traditional way.</P>
      <P>In offering services to the public, public service agencies specify the information that customers need to provide to avail of the services they offer as well as the manner in which the service is provided. In its consultation with public service agencies regarding the changes they are going to make to their service delivery processes in adapting to the broker model, reach will ensure that public service agencies bear in mind the recommendation of the Data Protection Commissioner that services also continue to be provided by traditional means.</P>
      <P>Data protection principles and respect for the privacy of the customer are at the heart of the broker philosophy. Reach sees data protection as an enabler and facilitator of the broker and as a means of securing public trust in the model it is developing. Reach maintains regular contact with the Data Protection Commissioner to develop and maintain best practice in implementing data protection principles.</P>

      <P>From January 1999 until September 2001, the payslips of established civil servants in my Department showed the euro equivalent of the net pay figure, with other amounts being shown in Irish pounds.

      <P>I refer the Deputy to Part II, section 5 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, regarding guardianship of national monuments. Guardianship allows a national monument to be taken into my care, thereby empowering me to carry out works on it using public moneys. There has been no further progress with the transfer of the property by the local authority to my Department but my officials have made informal contact with Kilkenny County Council to help them progress the matter. Until such time as the monument comes into my care, whether through transfer of title or through guardianship, I am unable to carry out works to it.</P>
      <P>The condition of the church has been monitored by my staff. When last inspected in mid July, photographs were taken but no formal report was compiled given that it is neither in my care nor are there any imminent plans for its repair. In the long-term, those repairs will be carried out, but any works needed there would not be of pressing priority in the context of the many other demands on some 740 properties which are already in my care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>All prisoners have the opportunity to make requests for temporary release through their prison governor. Decisions on temporary release applications and the general management of prison sentences are made either by myself or by senior officials from the prisons division of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Review meetings are held on a regular basis in each institution to facilitate the exchange of information and aid decision making. Each meeting is chaired by the governor with the attendance of senior prison management, probation and welfare staff, chaplains, teachers, other prison staff and an official from the prisons division of my <Col N="1079" /> Department. In addition, the Interim Parole Board may also advise me in relation to temporary release for prisoners coming before them. The board may review the cases of eligible prisoners serving determinate sentences of eight years or more but less than 14 years at the half sentence stage, and in the cases of prisoners serving sentences of more than 14 years or life sentences, at the seven year stage of sentence. The sentence review group had previously advised me in relation to the cases prisoners who had served more than seven years of a determinate or indeterminate sentence. The review group concluded its work in June of this year and the Interim Parole Board has now begun to interview eligible prisoners.</P>
    <P>Before granting temporary release careful consideration is given in each individual case to a number of factors including the nature and seriousness of the offence, previous record, behaviour in custody and-or during previous periods of temporary release, length of sentence served and any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration. The primary concern in considering whether to grant temporary release is the safety and security of the public. In this regard, the risk of the person not returning to prison following the period of temporary release or of committing an offence during the period of temporary release is always considered. It is important to note that decisions are only made following consultations with the Garda and local prison officials. Other matters considered are whether the prisoner has engaged constructively with the various prison based therapeutic services such as the Probation and Welfare Service, educational and work training programmes, and-or drug treatment programmes.</P>
    <P>In the majority of cases, temporary release is granted for constructive and rehabilitative reasons. For example, a prisoner may be released to attend educational and-or training programmes or courses. Another reason is to participate in work training with recognised agencies such as CERT, FÁS or PACE. The aim of this form of temporary release is to help the prisoner with employment prospects on the outside which will have the effect of reducing the risk of reoffending. In addition, short periods of temporary release to visit family members may be granted to prisoners in an effort to reduce the effects of institutionalisation and to aid familiarisation with the outside world.</P>
    <P>It should of course be noted that in the past a persistent high level of overcrowding in the committal institutions in the Dublin area resulted in the granting of release in an unstructured manner to many offenders at an early stage in their sentences. The construction of 1,200 new prison spaces in recent years has created a situation whereby the prison service is in a position to accommodate the vast majority of prisoners for the entire duration of their sentences. The &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; system is now largely a thing of <Col N="1080" /> the past. Of the total population of persons under sentence, the proportion on temporary release has declined from 19% in 1997 to a current figure of about 6%.</P>
    <P>The Government recently approved the publication of a Criminal Justice (Temporary Release) Bill, 2001. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, so as to provide a clearer legislative basis for the power to grant temporary release by setting down the principles which will apply in the exercise of this power. This Bill will provide a clear and transparent basis, as well as the necessary safeguards required, for the operation of the system of temporary release.</P>

The three helplines in question provide assistance in relation to visas, citizenship and general immigration, the latter helpline being the specific focus of the Deputy's question. That helpline facilitates over 250 customers per day, five days a week. The unprecedented demand for that service reflects the huge growth in the number of non-nationals who are present in the State, mainly for work or study purposes.

Following close examination of his case it was decided that a transfer to Castlerea Prison was not possible at that time and the prisoner was informed of this decision. The reasons for this decision were the continued high level of numbers in Castlerea, which I referred to in my original response.</P>

      <P>The level of resource teaching support being made available to the child in question is in line with that recommended by my Department's inspectorate following a review of the needs of the child in question and other children with special needs attending the school. Arising from this review, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department has recently conveyed approval to the school in question to increase the level of special needs assistant cover available to this child. As a result of this development, the child will now have special needs assistant support on a full-time basis.</P>
