      <P>Ba mhaith liom an deis seo a ghlacadh chun mo chomhbhrón agus comhbhrón mhuintir uile Fhine Gael a dhéanamh le clann Godfrey Timmins a d'éag go hobann aréir.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to mark the sudden and untimely death of Godfrey Timmins, a former member of Dáil Éireann, a life-long stalwart of the Fine Gael Party and a good friend and mentor of mine when I commenced service in this House in 1981. To Godfrey's wife Nora, his son Billy, who is a popular Member of the House, other members of his immediate family, his friends and his enormous circle of colleagues and supporters in Wicklow, I offer my personal condolences and those of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>Godfrey was a lover of Gaelic football, a sport that is renowned among Wicklow men. However, it was more than that for Godfrey Timmins. It was one of two consuming passions that filled his waking hours. When those hours were not totally filled by a passion for politics, he allowed his passion for football to take full expression. Tragic and untimely as his death was, it was fitting at least that it took place at a Gaelic football game in Dunlavin where Godfrey had gone to watch one of his grandchildren play in a minor match.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Godfrey had a long and distinguished parliamentary career as a Member of this House. He represented the people of his native Wicklow from 1968 to 1997, with only a two year break in that service from 1987 to 1989. Godfrey's service to the people of Wicklow spanned almost half a century. He served as a member of Wicklow <Col N="1114" /> County Council continuously from 1950 to 1999, a span of 49 years. During this time he served on the council's committee of agriculture, Wicklow VEC and the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>His long and distinguished career in national politics began with his victory in a by-election in March 1968 following the death of Labour Party Deputy James Everett. He was re-elected in the following year's general election and in every election until he lost his seat narrowly in 1987. Godfrey surprised many of his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party by deciding not to contest the subsequent Seanad election in which he would have been assured of a seat. Instead, he chose to wait and duly regained his seat in the Dáil in 1989. He held this seat until his retirement from national politics in 1997. During his time here, he served as the Fine Gael Party's Chief Whip, Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>While Godfrey was a distinguished parliamentarian, he will, I believe, be best remembered by Members of this House on all sides as the epitome of a gentleman &ndash; he was a gentleman and a gentle man. This is how his friends and colleagues will like to remember him. In his distinctive west Wicklow lilt, Godfrey generously dispensed many words of wisdom to young and inexperienced new Members of this House as they tried to find their feet in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>A verse in a very evocative Seamus Heaney poem, <i>The Diviner,</i> comes to mind.</P>
    <P>The bystanders would ask to have a try.</P>
    <P>He handed them the rod without a word.</P>
    <P>It lay dead in their grasp till nonchalantly</P>
    <P>He gripped expectant wrists. The hazel stirred.</P>
    <P>For many of us who first entered this House in 1981, Godfrey was our diviner. The well spring of this gentle, unassuming, wonderful man's life may now have run dry, but his great gift has been passed to others to continue the quest for a better life for all our people. Ar dheis lámh Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us were shocked to hear last night of the sudden death of Godfrey Timmins. As the leader of his party said, Godfrey was a true gentleman. He earned the admiration of his peers in Leinster House as an earnest and hardworking constituency politician. He was always concerned about how education, health and other issues that arise in the course of a Deputy's work would affect Wicklow and how he could get the most for his people. Since he was first elected to public office as a councillor in the 1950s, his gentle nature, good humour and, above all, dedication to the cause of the people of Wicklow ensured he enjoyed a lengthy career in local and national politics until his retirement from the Dáil in 1997 when he was proud to witness his son, Billy, succeed him as the Fine Gael TD for the constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to believe that someone would <Col N="1115" /> give such long service of 50 years to public administration and politics, but he did that for those five decades. His many duties during his time in the Dáil included periods as party Chief Whip and Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts where he had the respect of people on all sides of the House. He was a member of Wicklow County Council as whose chairman he served on a number of occasions. He had 50 years' unbroken service and that is a record I am sure has been equalled by very few.</P>
    <P>Godfrey was also dedicated to the cause of Gaelic football. He will be sadly missed by his enormous range of friends in the Gaelic football association in Wicklow, especially in Baltinglass Gaelic football club as whose chairman and president he served for many years. I recall his great joy and satisfaction when Baltinglass won the All-Ireland club championship in 1990. As far as Godfrey was concerned, that was better than any All-Ireland. With the club being the heart of the organisation, he was right in that.</P>
    <P>I offer my sympathy and that of the Government to his wife, Nora, his sons and daughters and Deputy Noonan and his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party which Godfrey Timmins served so well as a dedicated Member of the House. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the parliamentary Labour Party and the broader Labour Party, I join with the leader of the Fine Gael Party and the Taoiseach in expressing shock and extending sincere sympathy to the family of the late Godfrey Timmins. His death was a sudden shock. His son, Billy, was in the House until late last night dealing with the Private Members' motion, and this untimely event was certainly very far from his thoughts.</P>
      <P>As a representative of the neighbouring county of Wexford, I knew for many years of the reputation of Godfrey Timmins. He did not often create national headlines but was a different characters in terms of public representation, namely, one who looked after the needs of his people assiduously, the people of Wicklow in general and especially those of west Wicklow. His reputation went beyond the confines of the constituency he served so well.</P>
      <P>We extend our sympathy to his wife, Nora, and his five sons and three daughters. We remember his very long and distinguished record of service outlined by previous speakers which began with his by-election victory and entry to the House in 1968. He was elected nine times to the House. Anyone who manages that is doing something right. The legacy he left was the ability to have such a good name and reputation that his son, Billy, was able to follow in that fine tradition. It is a tradition represented by many families in the House. In a time when public service is often under threat, it is appropriate and proper we salute the fine, distinguished and honourable service of the Timmins family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> I would like the views of the parliamentary Labour Party and our deepest sympathy to be conveyed to the Timmins family and all Godfrey Timmins's colleagues in the broad Fine Gael Party and movement who have obviously suffered a grievous loss.</P>

      <P>Is cúis an-bhrónach nuair a chailltear seanchomráidí a bhí le na blianta fada sa Teach. Thar ceann an Pháirtí Daonlathaigh, déanaim cóbhrón le bean Godfrey Timmins, Nora, lena mhac, Liam, atá ina Theachta, agus leis an gcuid eile den chlann. Is mór an chailliúint dóibh é agus do Pháirtí Fhine Gael. Bhí Godfrey Timmins an-dúthrachtach ar feadh a shaol don pháirtí a rinne sé an-obair ar a shon.</P>
      <P>Is cuimhin liom go maith nuair a toghadh é in 1968 gurb é sin ceann de na chéad thoghcháin a raibh tionchar ag an teilifís air. Bhí ar na h-iarrthóirí bheith cleachtach as úsáid a bhaint as an teilifís. Bhí sé anseo chomh fada sin. Tháinig sé isteach beagáinín i ndiaidh mé fhéin agus bhíomar cáirdiúil ar feadh na mblianta.</P>
      <P>Fear an-lách ab ea é agus bhí sé an-dúthrachtach agus rinne sé an-obair ar son mhuintir a Dháilcheantar féin i gCill Mhantáin. Is mór an chailliúint a bhás don Dáilcheantar sin, do Pháirtí Fhine Gael agus don tír. Is maith an rud go raibh, go bhfuil agus go mbeidh le cúnamh Dé, daoine mar é atá sásta seirbhís phoiblí a thabhairt ar son a mhuintir. Neartaíonn sé sin an daonlathas sa tír. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to join the Taoiseach and other party leaders on this very sad occasion in paying tribute to a person who has been described by all speakers as a gentleman. That is the word that always trips off people's lips throughout the constituency of Wicklow and anywhere the name Godfrey Timmins has been mentioned.</P>
      <P>I had the pleasure of knowing Godfrey for almost all my life and we were very dear friends. Then again, as we all know, it was very easy to be friendly with Godfrey. He was the most modest and unassuming human being and politician I have ever known and it worked for him over a lengthy career. In the adversarial game we play, Godfrey made an art form of being non-adversarial and that also worked for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from Nora and his family, he had two passions. One was his politics and political life. He was a mere boy when he began what became 50 years of service in local government, apart from an illustrious career in national politics. His other passion was the GAA. I first got to know Godfrey through football activities. He played with his beloved Baltinglass. When it won the All-Ireland club championship, which is unusual for us in Wicklow, Godfrey was over the moon. That was a golden era for a fine club, as good a football club as ever represented any county. <Col N="1117" /> Baltinglass had a golden era in the 1980s and 1990s when it won eight championships. Godfrey was president of the club at that time and he derived great enjoyment and pleasure from that. It was fitting that his last moments were spent at a football match in Dunlavin last night. He was present to witness another generation of his family coming through on the football fields.</P>
    <P>We all picture the quiet, reserved gentleman that was Godfrey Timmins, but he was no easy touch. One does not stay in this business as long as Godfrey did and not have some steel in the spine, and he had that. I often witnessed him at fora in which we served together clenching the fist and hitting the table on many occasions, but that would be momentary. In his last moments in Dunlavin last night, he had words with the referee. That proves my point.</P>

      <P>It is not unknown, but Godfrey was a pacifist in the main. It is a sad day for the House and for all of us in County Wicklow to lose such a wonderful man. On behalf of the people of Wicklow, I extend our sympathies to Nora and his sons and daughters, especially our colleague in the House, Deputy Billy Timmins, to whom it must be a great shock. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been said, Godfrey Timmins was always described as a gentleman and as a gentle man. He was an extraordinary man who epitomised all that is good about public service. He had the uncanny knack of seeing everybody's side in an argument and was a man of quiet dignity. He was very bright when it came to examining issues of local governance and he served the people of County Wicklow with exceptional dedication, at local government level from 1955 right up to the turn of the Millennium, and in this House from 1958, with one small break, until his decision to step down in 1997. It was my great pleasure, privilege and honour to serve on Wicklow County Council and on the County Wicklow VEC with Godfrey and it was with the deepest sadness that I heard the news from Dunlavin last night. I had been speaking with Billy earlier about the issue he wished to raise on the Adjournment. We were to share time, and I simply could not believe that a man who has been like a great, noble redwood, standing above politics in County Wicklow all this time, had passed. On my behalf, on behalf of my family and of the Fianna Fáil organisation I express our deep personal regrets to Nora, to the sons and daughters, to the Fine Gael organisation in County Wicklow and to the wider Fine Gael family. He was a truly noble person and we were very lucky to have him for so long in this place, and Fine Gael were very lucky to have him for so long in that party. He will be deeply missed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great sense of loss and sadness right across County Wicklow at the news of the passing of Godfrey Timmins. He was, as people have said, a genuinely nice man, a kindly man, a man who was true to his principles, a modest man and a good friend. He made a lasting contribution to this House but we will remember him particularly for the work he has done, closely, with the people of County Wicklow, especially in west Wicklow. In a sense, he died as he lived. At local level, he made a strong and lasting contribution on behalf of people in his community. He had a quality that is rare in our profession, and is becoming even rarer, whereby he could be forceful and tough, but I do not think he even once denigrated any individual who took an opposing view to his. He was able to express his views in a way that was exemplary. He loved politics, he loved public service but was concerned at seeing a certain coarsening in political life and that is an expression of his outlook, of how he wanted to work with people rather than against them. His humanity is an inspiration, his integrity a shining example to all of us following in his footsteps and his loss is sorely felt in the community of County Wicklow. I express my sympathy to Nora and to his family, in particular to Billy who has shown in this House the same kind of dedication his father had and who, even last night, made a special effort to come to a meeting about a local issue despite having to make arrangements to do so prior to this event. Like father like son, there is a contribution that Godfrey Timmins made to this House, but more particularly to the people of County Wicklow, that will never be forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MildredFox" hpid="Miss Fox Miss Fox">
      <NameTxt>Miss Fox:</NameTxt>
      <P>I too sympathise with the Timmins family, with Nora, with the children, grandchildren and the wider family. Godfrey Timmins was, above all else, a thorough gentleman. He was a quiet man and only spoke when he had something meaningful to say, but when he did speak, people listened. That being said, he was well capable of fighting his corner but whenever he fought he did so without theatrics. From personal experience, having witnessed a number of arguments at Wicklow County Council, I know that he preferred to argue with somebody in private, rather than in the council chamber, and he achieved much for people in that way. He was not interested in personal gain and simply wished to work for the people who placed him where he was. The amount of work he has done for Wicklow and its people will never be measured and probably never truly known to anyone but Godfrey. He was of great help to me when I came into the Dáil, as one of the inexperienced people with seemingly nowhere to turn, and my father too received great help from Godfrey in his time. Like many in Wicklow, I feel I have not only lost a fine representative but a friend. He will be long remembered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise with the Taoiseach the subject matter of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on Tuesday evening last. It would appear that evidence from the then head of Military Intelligence, Colonel Michael Hefferon, was tampered with or altered. Members of the House may not have adverted to the fact that, at that time, the functions of the DPP were carried out by the Attorney General. It seems extraordinary that the then Attorney General, Mr. Colm Condon, who was exercising the functions of the DPP, did not see the original documents and was provided only with altered ones when preparing the book of evidence. Does the Taoiseach intend to have an inquiry into these matters to establish the facts? In that context, is the Taoiseach aware that the very lengthy and aborted inquiry into the Arms Trial by the Committee of Public Accounts 30 years ago produced an enormous archive? This <Col N="1121" /> archive not only has the proceedings of the committee but has quite a body of documentation attached to it. There is no procedure in this House to access the archive and it is not subject to the 30 year rule. It is locked up somewhere in the precincts of Leinster House. As a first step, will the Taoiseach arrange to move an order in the House &ndash; a procedure which was recommended by the Committee of Public Accounts in its conclusion to the DIRT inquiry &ndash; so that the archive can be made public and fully accessible? If questions are answered then so be it, but if they are not, it is important in the interests of democracy that any suspicion should be removed and the facts established. A parliamentary committee to examine and establish the facts and bring them forward without recommendation, might be the best way to proceed.</P>

      <P>On the Adjournment debate last night, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, said he would make an early statement to the House on this issue, but when will he do so? Does the Taoiseach propose to conduct any further inquiries to make clear the record concerning the suggestion that due process of law was interfered with in the events surrounding the investigation of the importation of arms in 1970? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this question. As Deputy Howlin has said, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made it clear during last night's Adjournment debate that the allegations made in the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme concerning the statement of a witness in the Arms Trial, by their very nature, give rise to concern. The Minister has consulted on this issue and has indicated that such limited inquiries that have been possible since the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcast point to the need for far more detailed inquiries, and these will be undertaken. I will raise this matter with the Minister. I am not exactly sure of the procedures that are necessary under the National Archives Act. If Deputy Noonan's information is that papers used by Oireachtas committees are not covered by the Act and cannot be accessed, then I will see what can be done. The Deputy's point would seem to make total sense. If all that correspondence was documented but cannot be accessed under the 30-year rule, we will have to examine the situation to ensure the completeness of any examination. The Minister is pursuing the matter and he will report back to the House after the recess, as soon as he is in a position to do so. In the meantime I will communicate with Deputy Noonan on precisely what we need to do under the provisions of the National Archives Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that these events occurred a long time ago and that many Members of the House cannot even recall them. The staff of the Department of Justice who dealt with these events, particularly on the security side, have long since retired from service. Therefore, it seems <Col N="1122" /> that an internal inquiry in the Department will lead nowhere since such an inquiry would merely look at the documentation. Will the Taoiseach reflect on these matters and bring forward a fuller proposal which might involve a committee of the House? </P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach examines the recommendations made by the sub-committee of the Committee of Public Accounts which inquired into the DIRT affair, he will see a recommendation which is relevant to the publication of the archives. The sub-committee was anxious that its own material would be archived. It has pointed out that there is no access to archives arising from the proceedings of a parliamentary committee, unless an order of the Dáil requires it. Such material does not come within the ambit of the National Archives Act but we have a simple remedy whereby, if we can agree an order of this House, all the material can be made public. Will the Taoiseach proceed in this manner as a first step, and come back to us with a proposal for an inquiry which would allay the widespread public concern about this matter. It cuts right to the roots of our democracy if this allegation and the motives which have been attributed to it are sustained.</P>

We will make a more detailed report as soon as the House returns from the Easter recess.</P>

      <P>Before the House returns from the short Easter recess on 1 May, strike notice on the ESB will have expired. The consequences of that will include significant black-outs unless the strike is averted. Bearing in mind the catastrophic result of any such action on the economy, and particularly on the tourism sector which is already reeling from the impact of foot and mouth disease, what action has the Taoiseach or the Minister for Public Enterprise taken to address and resolve this issue? What further actions will be taken between now and the expiry date for strike action? Does the Taoiseach accept that the issues involved in this dispute concern the Government directly as the major shareholder? In fact, they are issues that only the shareholder, as the owner of the ESB, can resolve directly. Will the Taoiseach outline exactly the course of action he intends to take to prevent this catastrophe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned or worried by the fact that the PPF seems now to apply only to the private sector? Right across the public service strikes are occurring, or strike notice is being served, at Aer Lingus, Iarnród Éireann and the ESB. Some 11,000 clerical officer grades in the Civil Service have voted by 3 to 1 <Col N="1123" /> to withdraw from the PPF. Is the Taoiseach concerned that the writ of the PPF no longer runs? Does he have an alternative industrial relations strategy which he can put before the House? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of these disputes &ndash; though not all &ndash; are related to PPF issues, including the ESB one. I do not think we need an alternative strategy but it would certainly be welcome if some of the ongoing inter-union difficulties did not exist and if people stuck firmly to the peace clause of 4 December. They are bound by that peace clause and they should stick to it.</P>
      <P>On the ESB strike, strike notice is to take effect on 23 April and SIPTU has lodged a pay claim for 28%. Intensive inter-union and management discussions have already commenced and it is hoped they will achieve something. The Minister, her officials and the officials on the industrial relations side are involved in those intensive discussions and will be for the next number of days to try to avert what would be a very serious dispute. The House can be assured, therefore, that throughout the Easter break the officials will also be working to try to avert this dispute and find a resolution to it because 23 April is not far away.</P>
      <P>On the greater issue, I commend the Labour Court for averting what would have been a very serious strike at Aer Lingus today at the start of the busy bank holiday weekend. I thank Mr. Flood and his colleagues for that work. In the case of Guinness, the Labour Relations Commission is involved today in detailed discussions to try to bring an end to the strike which commenced in the early hours of this morning. I hope those involved in other disputes will use the industrial relations machinery of the State and not take what in most cases is unnecessary strike action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to focus exclusively on what is potentially the most catastrophic strike we face in terms of our economy and our future, that is the ESB strike. Will the Taoiseach agree that this strike must be averted in the economic interest of the country? Specifically, will he accept my view that as the stakeholder on behalf of the people, the Government has a direct role to play in this dispute, which it does not have in many of the other disputes to which the Taoiseach referred, that the restructuring of the ESB is at the heart of the matters involved and that a clear involvement of the Minister for Public Enterprise will be critical to the resolution of this matter? Can he give us the assurances now that that involvement will take place and will he explain the reason it has not taken place to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and her officials are very closely in touch with this issue but the dispute has to be resolved in the first instance in inter-union and management discussions with whatever assistance is required from the Labour <Col N="1124" /> Relations Commission or the Labour Court. The Minister and her officials will use their remit to the best of their ability to try to prevent this dispute going ahead, as she does in all the public enterprise areas, and we have had many difficulties in those areas over the past 12 months. The Deputy can be assured that the Minister, her officials, management and inter-union efforts, the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission will do all they can to avoid this dispute.</P>

First, there was a statement from Government about two years ago on the projected roll-out of digitalisation and the legislative requirements that would facilitate that. As it is now at least two years out of date, is the Taoiseach concerned that the legislation necessary for digitalisation, particularly in relation to broadcasting, is now in tatters? Second, is it true that opposition from other Departments is the basis for the failure to publish the heads of the Bille na Gaeilge, which confers rights on citizens to do their business with State bodies through the medium of the Irish language? If the Taoiseach is not concerned, the likelihood now is that the Bill will not be delivered in the lifetime of this Government.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;2º No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State which are necessitated by the Statute of the International Criminal Court.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment involves the inclusion of an additional sub-article. As it stands, the Schedule proposes that the clause &ldquo;The State may ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court done at Rome on the 17th day of July, 1998.&rdquo;, be inserted into the Constitution. Amendment No. 1 provides that a further sub-clause which states &ldquo;No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State which are necessitated by the Statute of the International Criminal Court.&rdquo;, should be inserted.</P>
      <P>At first glance it might appear that my proposal is lawyerly in nature and perhaps that is the case. At the same time, however, we are dealing with the basic law of the State in the form of an amendment to the Constitution. Unfortunately, we are dealing with it in a somewhat hurried fashion. The difficulty I face in agreeing to the time frame proposed by the Government is that while I am enthusiastically in favour of ratifying the Rome Treaty, as Opposition spokesperson I want to see it done properly. It was that concern which led me to table this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the Chairman of the All-<Col N="1130" /> Party Committee on the Constitution, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is present. He is aware that a view emerged at meetings of said committee that there is an absolute need to take proper care and spend adequate time reflecting on how to amend the Constitution. We are running contrary to that view in respect of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Arising out of my enthusiasm to see the Statute of the International Criminal Court ratified, I was moved to draft a Bill similar to that before us and I was obliged to consider the mechanics of what would be necessary to ensure that the provisions of the statute would be taken on board in a proper manner. When the Government produced this legislation, I discovered it followed the text of the Bill I introduced but that it excluded the provision set out in amendment No. 1. There may be good reasons for that and I am anxious to hear the Minister's comments in that regard.</P>
    <P>When I drafted my Bill, I took advice from a respected senior counsel and his assistants. When considering the wording contained in the Constitution we must also consider why there is a need to amendment the Constitution. The basic issue is that this House should ratify the Rome Statute to establish the international criminal court. The Bill does not ratify the statute, however, it will amend the Constitution to enable us to ratify the statute. Why is it necessary to amend the Constitution? I have not seen the Attorney General's advice, but yesterday the Minister stated that because Article 34.1 of the Constitution is phrased in a particular way we must amend the Constitution. The article in question provides that &ldquo;Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution. . . &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I accept the Attorney General's advice that because of the wording used in Article 34 it is necessary to amend the Constitution to enable us to give jurisdiction to the international criminal court. It should be borne in mind, however, that apart from granting that jurisdiction we will also, as the Taoiseach made clear, introduce legislation and adopt administrative measures to enable us to ratify the statute. As we have not seen that legislation I cannot judge its constitutionality, although I gather it may be akin to the International War Crimes Tribunals Act. As regards the administrative measures, I can only go on what the Taoiseach said, namely, that we need administrative measures. However, I do not know what they are.</P>
    <P>If we examine what was done when we undertook other international obligations, we ensured there would not be a problem by including a provision akin to the clause I am suggesting we should include for the International Criminal Court. We had to make provision in our Constitution for the Treaty of Rome, which set up the Common Market, and subsequently for the treaties amending it to become a member of the European Economic Community and to ratify the European treaty on European Union which was signed at Maastricht and the Treaty of Amster<Col N="1131" /> dam which amended the treaty on European Union. We also included a provision which states that no provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State which are necessitated by the obligations of membership of the European Union or of the Communities. There is precedent in the Constitution for such a proposal.</P>
    <P>We do not have much time because of the Government's schedule to properly reflect on this proposal. We are ratifying a statute which sets up an International Criminal Court. The name implies that people will be subject to international criminal law. They may have charges of genocide or other such crimes levelled against them. We must be sure that what we do is watertight. The Minister might say I am adopting a belt and braces approach and perhaps that is true. I am not a constitutional expert but an Opposition spokesperson making a constructive suggestion on how to not only improve the Bill, but to make it watertight. I tabled this amendment in a genuine effort to be constructive in the short time available to us to pass this Bill in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, I can see a strong case for the wording of the suggested referendum to be co-terminous with the suggested legislation which would arise on ratification. However, he might want to elaborate on some aspects of his amendment which are interesting. The remit of the new court cannot be regarded as an extension of the Irish legal system. It involves a transfer of jurisdiction. There is the principle of the acceptability of the transfer of jurisdiction to a new institution for which the jurisprudence has been debated. The applied form of that jurisprudence will probably take place in the legislation but it is circumscribed by the terms of establishment of the court which, for example, allow a seven year derogation in relation to certain rights of defence and arrest for member countries which ratify on the basis of times of war or crimes committed on their territory. We have been assured by the Minister, although it is not in legislative form, that Ireland will not exercise that derogation from the general principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want clarification on this issue. I support Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on the principle that these matters would be clearer if the necessary legislation was available at the same time as the consultation with the public is taking place. I also see a problem in so far as the amendment suggests that no provision of this Constitution &ldquo;invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State which are necessitated by the Statute of the International Criminal Court&rdquo;. I am not sure my non-legal interpretation of the statute is in sufficient finite form if one wants precision in relation to the constitutional amendment. One could perhaps secure the best precision by a simple assent to ratify. If, however, one was to go further and say that anything that might be con<Col N="1132" /> cluded in an entity which is still evolving, for example, acts of regression which are still a matter of debate, I am not sure one would not create a further problem. I welcomed the assurance we were not operating a caveat in terms of years and its application. The best position for us all to take is one in which the court is as strong as possible. We discussed that yesterday and there is unanimity on it.</P>
    <P>I am also worried about another issue. What type of question will be put to the public in the referendum? Is it a simple permission to ratify or a permission to ratify with the understanding that there is a transfer of jurisdiction which, in some respects, is not closed? The Minister might refer to that in his reply as it is important. A principle of our foreign policy, with which I disagree to some extent, is that we do not ratify in advance of legislation being in place. Different Governments, including those of which I was a member, have always argued that until all the required legislation is in place for compliance, one does not ratify. That is a principle and a decision of the Government. However, it is an excessively conservative view. There are exceptions around the world which would prove me wrong where it is the most cynical act to ratify and then to ignore the implications of what one is doing. It is a high moral position but it creates a certain tardiness in relation to achieving the result.</P>
    <P>Where does that leave us? Is this a significant departure from that policy? It is a legitimate argument for the Minister to say it is the type of risk one must take. However, it is not as much a risk as an act of trust in how the court will shape itself and evolve. Its jurisprudence is being challenged by other countries but I do not have a difficulty with it. I am a little worried, having seen Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment, at the degree of imprecision which might be sown in the public mind as it answers a question on whether it should ratify it. My advice to the public is unequivocal; we should vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would have been better if the accompanying legislation had been co-terminous with the amendment to the Constitution. It is important in relation to the administrative procedures. We discussed yesterday how to deal with those responsible for atrocities of one kind or another. However, we did not spend as much time discussing defence, which is a legitimate legal concern. These procedures will need to be specified in relation to the movement of a person from this jurisdiction to the remit of the court. The relationship, for example, of a national prosecutor to the prosecutor the court might bring into existence and the resources and procedures which will follow must also be specified. The phrase used in the drafting of the speeches is as clever as one would expect. What is meant by compatibility? That question is probably answered in the specified administrative procedures. I would like clarification from both Deputy O'Keeffe and the Minister. There may be a <Col N="1133" /> downside to the amendment, which may create an atmosphere of imprecision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the traditional policy that we only ratify where we have sincere intent to implement. That is the point of departure in our State practice on ratification. There are so many states around the world that ratify treaties with abandon and do not proceed to take the steps to secure their effective implementation in their own legal system. It is good that Ireland has always had this policy. While it can be frustrating for practising politicians because of the delay it causes in the implementation of measures, on balance it is a sensible policy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins also raised a question about the accompanying legislation. Given that we will have a referendum on this, people will want to know what they are voting for. However, the accompanying legislation here would be the Rome statute and the legislation to implement this measure will be a relatively short provision which would contain as a schedule the entire Rome statute. In effect, the legislation is before the people. All that is not before the people are the domestic legislative arrangements providing that the Rome statute shall now be part of the law of the State. I have no difficulty with this referendum on the accompanying legislation because the substance of it is already before the people. The same is true of the referendum on the Nice Treaty.</P>
      <P>However, the substantive amendment before us is a very interesting one. I do not question the spirit in which it has been put forward by the principle Opposition spokesperson, but I have very considerable reservations about it. I do not want those reservations to be taken as a criticism of the spirit in which it has been put forward. I appreciate the reason it was put forward. It was suggested by way of analogy with the existing provision in relation to our membership of the European Union. It is a very far reaching amendment because in its terms it provides that no provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State which are necessitated by the Statute of the International Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>I am not clear whether, under the Rome statute, the International Criminal Court will have power to enact any law. Where the wording envisages laws being enacted by the International Court, I would have thought the law was already defined in the Rome treaty. That is the substantive law that we are importing. There is no fresh legislation that has to be protected.</P>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to remove from all constitutional scrutiny any such law, although I question whether any such law might exist. In a more serious way, it would also exempt from any constitutional control, acts done or measures adopted by the State which are necessitated by the statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged in the statute that some investigations will be carried out by the domestic <Col N="1134" /> enforcement agencies in particular states. For example, the Garda Síochána could be called upon to make investigations into a major war criminal who could be in hiding in this jurisdiction. Far be it from me to protect the rights of international war criminals, but were this amendment pressed it would mean that such a person would not have any right to invoke the normal protections under the Constitution that any other suspect under investigation is entitled to invoke.</P>
    <P>This is a very far reaching amendment. I am not aware that this type of amendment was inserted when we ratified the British Irish Agreement. We did not exempt the effects of that agreement in our own legal system from all Constitutional control. If we were to adopt this amendment, we would exempt any consequential effects, within this jurisdiction from any constitutional scrutiny. We did that for the European Community legislation because when we joined the EEC in January 1973, we accepted a very wide ranging corpus of law that involved not just treaties but treaties that conferred law making and enforcement powers on institutions. These treaties had already been interpreted in 1973 as meaning that the Community was a new unique legal order, which intervened in a direct way in the legal system of each member state of the European Community.</P>
    <P>This treaty is in the Rome statute so it is not a statute of the same character as the European treaty. In order to observe our obligations under the Rome treaties, it was necessary for us to give that degree of additional protection to the effects of those treaties in our own legal system. If that had not been done at the time there was the danger that constitutional grounds could have been invoked to invalidate Community legislation and a conflict would have arisen between the Irish legal order and the Community legal order. I do not believe we are in the same position on this treaty.</P>
    <P>There is a further point, which I mentioned in the debate on the Nice Treaty. We are mistaken in the view that that clause in our European obligations is the central clause which permits the participation by the State in the European institutions. The authority, given by the people to permit the State to ratify the Rome treaties and since then the Maastrict, Amsterdam and Nice arrangements, is what imports the legislation into the State. That is what provides the constitutional protection.</P>
    <P>When the Supreme Court considered the Single European Act, under the Crotty case, it did not rule the provisions on qualified majority voting and creating additional competences for the European Union infringed the Constitution. The Single European Act was not a necessitated obligation; it was a fresh international obligation. Nevertheless the Supreme Court said that it was within the overall intention of the people when they authorised us to join the European Community that we could enter into an amending treaty of this character.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> The wording put forward by the Minister is clear and enables the people to give a general authorisation to the State to implement not just the Rome statute but any necessary amendments to the Rome statute in the future which fall within the overall intention or essential character of what the Rome statute represents now. The wording is sufficient to cover not only the obligations in the existing Rome statute but amending obligations that may be required from time to time. This may become a very busy tribunal if a very large number of international war criminals and offenders against human rights are brought to book. We may have to increase the number of judges and an amending statute would be required for that. I do not believe that would require a fresh referendum. The authority conferred here is sufficient to enable the State to implement this treaty and to uphold its international obligations.</P>
    <P>I understand the spirit in which Deputy O'Keeffe has put forward his amendment, but to take the further step advocated by him could entail some constitutional danger. We would then be telling the people not alone are we looking for authority to establish this court and to transfer judicial power to it, we are also providing that all of the effects of this court in the domestic legal order are entirely immune from scrutiny on constitutional grounds. When the Garda act on foot of this court, they are not obliged to respect the constitutional provisions relating to the liberty of the citizen or the inviolability of the dwelling place; they are not obliged to respect the constitutional provisions regarding the admission and obtaining of evidence. That would be a very far-reaching step. We took that step in regard to the European Communities because the obligations were so far-reaching that we had to prevent the possibility of a collision between our domestic legal system and the Community legal system. We had to establish natural justice and fundamental rights there on a Community basis. We accepted that our tradition on fundamental rights and due process would not apply to the Community legal order. We agreed to fight that battle in Brussels also.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to go that far in relation to this Statute. While I accept that the defence of the rights of the potential international war criminal is not a very popular proposition, nevertheless it would be open to misrepresentation if we included a provision of this character in a referendum. It could lead people to draw the conclusion that we are looking for very broad powers which are not required by the necessity of the case. Deputy O'Keeffe has raised a very interesting point. The phrase regarding the Acts which are necessitated has haunted our whole interpretation of the other provision and what it means. I am delighted he tabled this amendment which has provided us with the opportunity of looking at that issue again. I am not sure we have dispelled public confusion on that issue yet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> It is a matter one must weigh up on the scales. On balance, it is a legitimate point to raise but we would be better, in terms of clarity of the proposal, to leave it as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, understand Deputy O'Keeffe's motivation in tabling this amendment. It is right and proper that we ventilate this issue to ensure we find the best way forward. Deputies Lenihan and Michael D. Higgins have made very relevant points on this amendment which lead me to believe it would not be helpful to include it for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>We are all conscious that a constitutional amendment is a serious matter. It is important that we get the wording of any such amendment right. We have given Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment very careful consideration. He indicated his intention to take this approach during discussion of the Private Members' Bill and we have had some time to consider this issue and its implications. The proposed wording is clearly based on Article 29.4.7º of the Constitution, which was adopted in a totally different context &ndash; our membership of the European Union and of the Community. What is known as the &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo; formula was deemed necessary to import the very large European Community acquis into Irish law. As has been said, the European Community is a legislative community and as such EU directives have to be given legal force in Irish law and European law has supremacy over domestic law. Such a formula would not therefore be appropriate here. As the history of Article 29.4.7º has shown, it would invite constitutional challenge and therefore has the potential to hinder the State in the execution of its obligations under the Statute.</P>
      <P>The author of the &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo; formula in its original manifestation was former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald. It is a matter of regret to him that he put forward this proposal given the jurisprudence which has developed around this formula in terms of its interpretation by the Supreme Court in Crotty and other cases. While the intent and motivation behind the tabling of this amendment is understandable, I take it that Deputy O'Keeffe is seeking to include an explicit indication in Irish law that we are pro-actively anxious to ensure we meet our obligations under the statute. The jurisprudence which has built up around the &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo; formula, could lead to greater confusion than clarity. Were it to be adopted, it would also invite a debate on the referendum which would clutter and render more difficult in a complex way the basic issue, the incorporation of the Rome Statute into our constitutional law. It creates a line of argument which is not central in terms of people's understanding of the issues and would create a distraction by those who would seek to confuse the debate. Such a debate would not be necessary in practical terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the reason Deputy O'Keeffe tabled this amendment but I am advised that the enabling provision is sufficient because in <Col N="1137" /> enabling the State to ratify the statute it is implicit that the State may enact such laws and do whatever is needed to fulfil its obligations. An additional provision is not necessary as this issue is encompassed in the first provision. I have received very strong and clear advice in that regard. That is not to suggest that an argument cannot be made for a &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo; formula, an execution type wording formula or an &ldquo;in consequence of&rdquo; formula which, for those who are particularly familiar with the jurisprudence which has arisen in our constitutional law around those issues, is something that has been the subject of considerable debate.</P>
    <P>The ICC is complementary to the domestic court. More precisely, the ICC may intervene in the following circumstances: where there has been a total or substantial collapse of or unavailability of the domestic judicial system &ndash; not something we hope to see in this jurisdiction; where domestic proceedings are being conducted for the purpose of shielding the accused from criminal responsibility; or, where there has been an unjustified delay in domestic proceedings which is inconsistent with the intention to bring the person concerned to justice. Under Article 19 of the Statute, it is for the International Criminal Court to decide whether it is competent to intervene. The main involvement which the State will have in this court will be to provide assistance under Part IX of the Statute regarding the surrender of persons charged, evidence gathering and so on. Deputy O'Keeffe's concerns lie in the practical area of the operation of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court hence his wish to render explicit, through the insertion of this amendment, our intent to meet our obligations under the statute.</P>
    <P>We must decide whether we include a simple insertion in the Constitution permitting the State to ratify the Statute as was done regarding Article 29.4.8º in respect of the Luxembourg Agreement or whether we, in addition, provide that no provision in the Constitution invalidates laws enacted, Acts done or measures adopted by the State which are necessitated by the statute &ndash; that is known as the &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo; formula. After full consideration, and the Government acts on its legal advice, it is considered that the amendment should include only the single provision that is before the House, that is, that the State may ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court done at Rome on 17 July 1990.</P>
    <P>The view is that any &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo; formula is neither necessary nor appropriate to enable the State to comply with its international obligations under this statute. That is the basic point. The &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo; formula was deemed necessary to import a very large EEC <i>acquis</i> in 1972. It is a legislative Community with directives and regulations, those have to be given legal force in Irish law, and European law has supremacy over the domestic law. Using such a formula in this circumstance, as <Col N="1138" /> Deputy Lenihan has indicated, may fetter challenges to the implementation of the statute obligations, especially where it involves a contravention of a constitutional right in a matter not required by the statute.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that while we hold no brief for war criminals, a person would have recourse to our domestic judicial system. It is an issue to which we would be prepared to accede on the basis that, while we incorporate willingly the international criminal court, there is a human rights perspective and a recourse to judicial review or challenge. We must do this in a way which is legitimate within that framework, while not providing in the Constitution a further amendment which would invite constitutional challenge. This is because the jurisprudence has been so complex and argumentative that it would be used as a means of delay and not in a proper fashion. That is a distinction which we must take into account without compromising the integrity of the State position in enthusiastically adopting the statute, and making our agencies and officers available to co-operate in all circumstances with the prosecutor or the court in any given set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>That is the Government response to this amendment. I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for putting down the amendment. His is a legitimate point of view and one that should be raised in the House. For the reasons given and on the advice I have received, I ask the Deputy not to put the question but that is a matter for him. Deputy O'Keeffe's provision would not protect implementing legislation as this legislation would be passed before the State ratifies the Rome statute. It would, however, afford constitutional protection to legislation passed after the State becomes part of the statute where such legislation is necessitated by the statute. The broad provision that we are adopting allows for the incorporation of any subsequent amendment as well. This explicit further amendment is not required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister summed up the difference between us when he referred to the fact that I wanted to make explicit what he says is implicit in the single article that we are putting before the people. I may be accused of a belt and braces approach, but surely it is better to have explicit what the Minister says is implicit. We should consider what is going to happen. Deputy Brian Lenihan outlined the position of the war criminal who may be brought before the international criminal court and who will be dealt with in Ireland first. I accept the Deputy was not sympathising with any such war criminal but wanted to make sure that his or her rights would be fully respected. My concern is that if such a person is in the dock here, his or her lawyers will be looking carefully for a legal loophole. This area of the Bill is a loophole unless my amendment is included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brian Lenihan mentioned that a simple statute with the Treaty of Rome and the Schedule <Col N="1139" /> would be sufficient. Unfortunately, on a series of Dáil questions which I have tabled, that is not the response I have been getting. One reply from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last November said that the Rome statute was a very complex instrument. It would require long and careful consideration to establish the precise legislative provisions required to ratify the statute. Nothing has emerged. Deputy Michael Higgins also referred to the fact that we do not have the supporting legislation before us, so we do not know. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform went on to say that even a cursory examination of the statute would give an idea of the complex issues to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>This is another Minister talking about the complexity of the legislation required and he referred to the fact that there could be similarities with the International War Crimes Tribunals Act, 1998. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, added that there will also be differences because the statute is a more complicated and comprehensive instrument.</P>

      <P>In a situation where there will be legislation which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform says is very complicated, and a situation where the Taoiseach says there will be administrative measures &ndash; what they are or how many there are I do not know &ndash; to underpin ratification of the statute, our job is to ensure that what has to be done will be fully covered by the Constitution. To go back to an earlier point made by Deputy Michael D. Higgins on the danger of imprecision, I fully accept that. My approach is quite the contrary. If we rely on the single provision proposed by the Government as giving the implicit constitutional power to introduce any necessary legislation and any necessary measures, then we are taking a leap in the dark.</P>
      <P>If we were to make it explicit that any laws enacted or measures necessitated by the statute and adopted by the State are covered constitutionally, that would meet the precise objective to which we all aspire. We all want to ensure the court will be successful and will not be subject to constitutional challenge by any party called before it. The argument boils down to an explicit <i>versus </i>implicit approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot easily return to the people on this issue if we get this wrong. I appreciate the point made about the words &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo; and the difficulties which have arisen in regard to recent <Col N="1140" /> EU treaties. It is regrettable that wording was not given further consideration at the time; perhaps an Opposition spokesperson could have raised the issues I am now raising or the Supreme Court could have taken an different interpretation. However, I must accept our laws.</P>
    <P>I do not envisage a new statute being introduced in regard to the International Criminal Court. Even if the words &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo; were used, problems would not arise as a further statute is unlikely to be introduced. If such a statute were introduced, it could be necessary to hold another referendum. Changes and additions may be made to the existing statute. As Deputy Higgins pointed out, &ldquo;aggression&rdquo; may be added to its terms as it will be possible to make additions to the court's jurisdictional powers. Provision is also made for further conferences which may give rise to some expansion of the court's jurisdiction. These matters are already provided for in the statute's 128 articles.</P>
    <P>I do not see any problem with the use of the words &ldquo;necessitated by&rdquo; although I may be proved wrong. If anything, those words may be too limiting and I should perhaps develop my amendment further. I am not convinced by the arguments against this provision. It would put us in a far stronger position to make explicit in the Constitution what the Minister suggests is implicit. If that is what it boils down to, it is surely better to be explicit.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe has come closer to the kernel of the issue on this occasion. Two issues arise from his contribution, one of which is the question of any further amendments to the Rome Statute. On the authority of the Crotty case, once the people enact the formula proposed by the Minister, the State will have authority to negotiate technical amendments to the Rome Statute and any amendments so negotiated will not require a new referendum. Indeed, were the formula proposed by Deputy O'Keeffe to be adopted, doubts could arise as to whether the State could do that. If changes were to be negotiated to the statute which would effect a fundamental change in its character, that would require a new referendum on the wording proposed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal issue addressed by Deputy O'Keeffe related to the &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations&rdquo; formula and whether it should be transposed into this context. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated that this implementing legislation involves complex, far-reaching questions. There is no doubt but that the Rome Statute will be a schedule to the legislation so what are the far-reaching issues which must be addressed? One is a simple provision stating that the statute is now part of the State's domestic law. As domestic authorities will be required to assist in the statute's enforcement, provisions would also be included to confer powers of search, arrest, entry etc. on the Garda as required. We <Col N="1141" /> are free to enact such provisions at this stage without making any constitutional amendment but if we do so and confer standard police powers on the Garda in regard to the investigation of new international offences and if we adopt the formula proposed by Deputy O'Keeffe, the exercise of those powers, which would be described in Acts of the Oireachtas, would be completely removed from constitutional provision. The formula he proposes states that &ldquo;nothing in this Constitution may be invoked to invalidate&rdquo;. That effectively means we would be empowered to pass statutes conferring standard police powers which would be entirely removed from constitutional invalidation. That would be a very far-reaching step to propose to the people in the context of a measure which does not strictly oblige us to do hold a referendum. We would then be inviting the people to empower the Oireachtas not alone to implement the Rome Statute and any ancillary domestic legislation required but to entirely remove that legislation from constitutional control. I am not sure it would assist the public debate if we had to explain and justify such a proposition. That is my core objection to this proposal.</P>
    <P>Former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, a then Opposition Deputy, proposed this formula at the time of the original decision to join the European Community and it has been misconstrued time and again during public discussion on the matter as implying that every fresh obligation into which we enter on the international plane requires a constitutional referendum. That is not what it means. It means that the obligations we undertake at any given point in time in the EU are immune from constitutional challenge. That would result in all of the measures taken to implement this statute being entirely removed from constitutional scrutiny. The question arises as to whether the court itself would be comfortable with that position or whether it expects the individual investigating authorities in particular states to entirely remove their standard domestic protections from the exercise of police powers in their jurisdictions. This is a far-reaching question and not one we should visit on the people on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to the contributions made on this interesting amendment tabled by Deputy O'Keeffe. We are grateful to him for doing so as the amendment has facilitated a debate on a somewhat neglected principle of constitutional amendment. If Deputy Lenihan is correct in assuming that members of the public are aware of the matter about which they are being consulted, that is a strong argument for a short piece of legislation to which the statute would be appended as a schedule. Such legislation would allow Ireland to contribute to the court, draw up procedures for nominating judges etc. It would be possible to subsequently introduce or amend legislation in regard to the role of the Garda, the Army etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> I do not see any merit whatsoever in the argument advanced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the effect that this is such a complex matter than one cannot see the shape of the legislation until such time as one addresses all of the issues involved. There is a down-side to that argument, namely that it does not sustain Deputy Lenihan's position with which I agree. If the position he advances were the one on offer, I would not have any difficulty with it. Members of the public would know the full facts of the matter they were being asked to ratify and would be apprised of the certainties and uncertainties involved. I cannot understand why that approach is not adopted. As I listened to the reply given to Deputy O'Keeffe by the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, I began to think this will not be so wearisome in relation to how it works that the principles of the international court are almost being contravened by the consideration of how it would impact on our system. I said in my opening contribution that I share Deputy Lenihan's concern regarding the position of any citizen before the law in relation to certainty. I have a difficulty with the amendment in relation to certain words. Perhaps Deputy Lenihan is construing it too far when he suggests one is speaking about laws generated by the Statute of the International Criminal Court. I presume these are laws that are in response to obligations it is assumed would arise following the constitutional adoption. Leaving that aside, there is a real problem with the interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;necessitated by the Statute of the International Criminal Court&rdquo;. With whom would one have this discussion? The problem about the Rome Statute, given its 50 year evolution from 1948, assisted by Trinidad and Tobago in the 1980s, including the meetings in Rome and the changes sought and so on, is with whom would one initiate the argument as to what constitutes necessity in relation to any provision of the statute? I am not a lawyer but, looking at it from outside as spokesman on foreign affairs, I would have to ask is this court an institution of the United Nations? If it is an institution of the United Nations, there is a law in place in relation to our United Nations obligations, which could handle some powers of investigation. However, this is not the case either in terms of its funding or operation.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside matters raised on Second Stage, one of the difficulties that arises in relation to the future of this court is that of political abuse. This has already been revealed by those who have chosen not just to delay signing but refused to ratify. If that is the case, one is better off without the amendment. On balance, the ideal position is to put a simple proposal to voters, that is, permission to ratify and a clear indication of what is being ratified. On the practical arrangements in relation to the text which will be put to the public and the setting up of the referendum commission, if the commission is to do a summary on what the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, says is so complex that it baffles even his great brain, one <Col N="1143" /> wishes the commission well. Would it not assist everyone if the legislation was published before the voting takes place? In that case, one could refer to the published legislation, which would be a good way to run the referendum. I cannot understand why that case is not accepted by Government, even if it means delaying the date for the referendum.</P>
    <P>Some 27 countries had ratified in January &ndash; perhaps it is now 30 &ndash; while 60 countries need to ratify for the provision to come into effect. We are not holding up anything internationally by treating it in a particular way. If the referendum is held on the basis suggested here, it is inviting the public to harbour fears. Perhaps Deputy O'Keeffe disagrees with me. This creates further fears in the public's mind which may not be real. I am certain they are not real in that nothing by way of the constitutional screen shall stand before any action or requirement of a court whose procedures have not been seen. I worry about that aspect for another reason.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe's amendment seems to take away the constitutional screen. It is a principled position which will allow the court to be strong and have no impediment in its way. Those accused of breaches should not seek refuge in the tickets of the law, so to speak. However, the tickets are our tickets. It is interesting that as the court is interpreted in the different countries that have signed up and ratified, they have an evolved jurisprudence which is based on certain principles of certainty which are very old. These relate not just to what one is accused of, but to process. That argument is one of the few decent pieces of the liberal agenda which was not distorted by those who came later and ruined it by applying it to economics. The principle of certainty is a good one and the Constitution gives expression to that. On balance, if we are in the unsatisfactory position of not having the legislation available before the date of the referendum, it would be better to put a simple suggestion to the people rather than an elaborated one. Therefore, I find it difficult to support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>In my attempt to be magnanimous, perhaps Deputy O'Keeffe misinterpreted my position as saying that this is an explicit and implicit interpretation of the same thing. That is not the case. My basic point was that of the principle or formula which was deemed to be necessary in 1973, and about which its author now has grave doubts. This primarily related to the importation of a body of law to be incorporated into domestic policy. That is not the situation here. A better analogy would be how we incorporated the patents issue, which is what we are doing here. A more secondary proposition is that the full extent and effect of the Article 29.4.7º formula is not completely certain. In other words, what will be made explicit is not simply showing our approval to assist in every way possible. There is a jurisprudence which has arisen out of <Col N="1144" /> the necessitated formula which leads to uncertainty in terms of full extent and effect as it would apply here. Such a formula might permit more than is necessary for the State to comply with its international obligations.</P>
      <P>This view is based on the substance of the Rome Statute which is likely to involve powers of compulsion and surrendering of Irish citizens abroad for extremely serious crimes, which is a theoretical possibility. Such powers of compulsion notoriously involve risks of infringement of fundamental rights. The suspect can challenge the admissibility of illegally obtained evidence at the International Criminal Court. The statute contains comprehensive and due process requirements. No doubt the rules of procedure will spell out further such requirement when they come into force. In so far as the State is implementing obligations under the statute, the statute should not give permission to diverge from constitutional norms except in so far as that is required by the statute. This is, if you like, the perspective that has been incorporated. The need to be seen to fully comply is, of course, important in terms of our international reputation. The need to accord to citizens, or to anybody in this territory who may be sought, the normal constitutional rights domestically, as would be available in the procedures were they to go direct to the international criminal court, is another consideration. We must determine the best way of including those legal principles or legal concerns in a way that is pragmatic, clear and certain and in a way which does not mean that, in our attempt to show our explicit enthusiasm for this concept, we end up giving permission to diverge from constitutional norms, except in so far as required by the statute. That is the issue when it is all boiled down. For the reasons I have given in my previous contribution, we take this view. The strong legal advice is as I have given.</P>
      <P>The European patents agreement, which provides for referring a matter, for example, to the ECJ and for an appeals court, required a constitutional amendment and we are proceeding on this basis in the same way. The idea of ceding sovereignty to the court on these issues, as set out in statute, is what is involved here. That is a closer analogy in terms of how one would constitutionally give expression to that in our Constitution than is the case necessitated by formula which really belongs to the importation of this <i>acquis </i>in the EU which is a much broader issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Treaties will enjoy the presumption of constitutionality and if they are enacted in legislation, they will certainly do so. This was stated in the Supreme Court in the Crotty <i>v.</i> An Taoiseach case. It has not been normal in the case of other international agreements to enact any constitutional amendment or to give any protection to them above what is available under the law. It is notoriously difficult to predict the facts which may give rise to an allegation of unfairness amounting to unconstitutionality. If a particular treaty were to impact on the rights of an individ<Col N="1145" /> ual as to deprive him or her to a serious extent of a constitutional right, it seems hardly unreasonable that they should be able to invoke the provisions of the Constitution. Such cases are, in any event, extremely rare &ndash; we know that. We are having a discussion, if you like, on the principle of the matter.</P>
    <P>The problem arising, as I have said, from membership of the European Communities was different. I do not know if there is anything more I can say about it other than that we have tossed it around. It is good that we have ventilated this argument and have had a discussion on it. I am grateful to the Deputy for raising it. For the reasons I have given, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems there is an honest difference of view on what may be seen by many to be an esoteric point, although I do not believe it is. It is a basic constitutional point. I would like to cover a few of the issues raised in these last contributions. I understand Deputy Higgins's point that he wants things to be precise. Precision and certainty are very important in the law, but precision and certainty are in the Rome statute &ndash; in the 128 Articles setting up the international criminal court. We are adopting every one of those Articles &ndash; no more and no less. That is my starting point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have looked through the document and, on the face of it, it looks like very heavy, complex stuff but, in fact, it makes a lot of sense and is very well put together. It is a product of years of work on the part of the negotiating bodies. I want us to adopt it exactly as it is &ndash; no more and no less. To do that, we must amend our Constitution. That is where I have to point out my major difference with Deputy Lenihan, in particular. He argued his point well but he is entirely wrong in the point he made. He said that if my amendment is accepted, the exercise of the powers would be entirely removed from constitutional invalidation. I say exactly the opposite. If my amendment is <Col N="1146" /> not accepted, the approach could be then constitutionally suspect and that is where I have a difference with Deputy Lenihan. We leave open the road to constitutional challenge unless we provide that laws enacted, which have been necessitated by the Rome statute, are constitutionally watertight. That is the reason for the amendment. I listened very carefully to the contributions and all were well made, but I cannot accept the argument from the Government benches.</P>
    <P>There is one further point and it arose in the references to the Crotty decision and the need for the amendments to the Rome Treaty, and to Maastricht and Amsterdam, to be made by way of referenda. I do not see that situation arise in relation to the Rome statute and the international criminal court because there is specific provision within the statute. Article 121 covers the position in regard to amendments. If we adopt the Rome statute, we adopt Article 121 which provides for amendments and the procedure by which amendments will be made. In that situation, we are not moving into a Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice situation and a Crotty type decision. We adopt the statute in its entirety, including the provision for amendments in Article 121.</P>
    <P>On that basis, there is an honest difference of view on this. It was important to raise this point. I am not convinced by the Government arguments that this provision should not be included. I do not think there is any danger of the public being confused. I will have words with the Minister about a glorious proposal in regard to the Nice Treaty and the way that is phrased but that is for another day. The political will is there to adopt the Rome statute. We want to see the international criminal court set up and to be in a position to ratify it. Above all, we want to ensure that once it is ratified and set up it will be effective and that it will not be open to constitutional challenge here. To ensure that it is constitutionally watertight, my amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I have no problem with the substance of the section but I ask the Minister to check if the numbering proposal is correct. There are a number of referendum Bills, including the legislation relating to the Nice Treaty. The Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution Bill states that the additional text will be inserted after section 8 of the English text. This relates to Article 29.4.8º. The Bill relating to the Nice Treaty states that the provisions in relation to the Treaty of Nice shall be inserted in Article 29.4 and that, as part of the change, subsections (7) and (8) shall be numbered subsections (9) and (10).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a mechanical numbering point because it appears two subsections (9) are being proposed. This Bill proposes that its provision will be subsection (9) while the legislation relating to the Nice Treaty states that the Nice provisions will be subsections (9) and (10). I raise this point to ensure constitutional correctness and proper drafting. It appears there is a contradiction between the two Bills because they both provide for new subsections (9). That will not work and a <Col N="1149" /> solution must be found. It may be the case that this Bill does not need to be amended and that the change can be made in the Bill that is subsequently introduced. If the Bill relating to the international criminal court is passed today, the necessary technical change can be made in the Bill relating to the Nice Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>The House had an opportunity last week to discus the Treaty of Nice and the proposed referendum the Government wants to put to the people at some stage in the next few months. I and my colleagues support the treaty, encourage people inside and outside the House to vote for it, and encourage those parties supporting the treaty to support it publicly and to canvass and campaign on its behalf to ensure it is passed by the people. I have some comments to make later on the timing of the treaty.</P>
      <P>It is important the treaty is passed in substantial numbers by the people. Anyone who has observed the development of Europe will have seen that one of the ugliest and most insular developments has been the rise of the far right. Colleagues will know of the support obtained in Austria by Mr. Jörg Haider and by other movements in Germany and France which have come about in recent years. We in western Europe need to be conscious of this and need to attack that neo-Nationalist, far right element developing in central and western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are parallels in Ireland. The rise of the Sinn Féin Party is similar to the rise of the far right and neo-nationalism in western Europe. Those of us who witness the rise of Sinn Féin need to be aware of that. There are no fundamental differences between the rise of Sinn Féin and that of Jörg Haider. Both those political entities set out a view of nationalism more akin to the views of the previous century, which is insular and which continually objects to the inclusion of large groups of ethnic minorities. There is a simi<Col N="1152" /> larity between the rise of Haider and the rise of Sinn Féin in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be very clear about that. One of the reasons the First World War occurred in the earlier part of the previous century was the rise of nationalism. There are many types of nationalism. There is an economic nationalism in Ireland. Those of us who have witnessed the growth in new wealth have also seen the rise of the view that citizens can now punch the sky because they are economically independent and do not need to depend on other parts of Europe, either for their income, trade or political security. We must be conscious of that.</P>
      <P>I make that point because it is one of the reasons the European project is deviating from its true course. We have given space to extreme elements which have no view of their international obligations and use the debate in Ireland as a means of issuing cheap party political propaganda for themselves and their parties in advance of the next general election. It is wrong for those groups to misuse this debate, and I include the Green Party in that. Those parties, including the Green Party, who misconstrue the position have a great deal for which to answer. We know the reason we must undergo this constitutional charade to ratify the treaty. Since Ireland first joined the European Economic Community in 1973, a group of people have lied to the people and Members know who they are. They have misconstrued the debate before and will do so in advance of the referendum. Those parties, like the Green Party, who are responsible for this have a great deal to answer for when it comes to this debate.</P>
      <P>Irish people are renowned for their generosity when it comes to the Third World and there is unanimity in the House on supporting Third World development. Why can the same arguments not be made when it comes to the Second World? Many of the countries seeking accession to the European Union in the next ten years are former Second World countries. I recently had an opportunity to visit Romania which is a long way from joining the EU and can be described as a former Second World country. Why do we have one view when it comes to the Third World and a different view when it comes to former Second World countries? It appears that this club, the European Union, is only for western Europe and not for central and eastern Europe. That is profoundly wrong and insular and fuels the type of Nationalist tensions which ultimately led to the First World War and which now threaten the course of the European Union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of criticisms to make of the Government's handling of European affairs. It is profoundly wrong that this refer<Col N="1153" /> endum will take place on the same day as three other referenda proposed by the Government. That is a bad mistake. It will increase confusion and swell the &ldquo;no&rdquo; votes on the day. I know the Government is intent on including this referendum with the other three but I appeal to it to reconsider. We have a great deal of time because the treaty does not have to be ratified until December 2002. The accession countries still have to conclude their negotiations. We have until December 2002 to ratify the treaty. We have a great deal of time and we should tread carefully. We should not hold the referendum on the same day as the three other referenda.</P>
      <P>Unlike others, I am not fearful of the result. People understand the internal logic at the heart of Europe and the concessions which must be made in terms of sovereignty and pooling resources to get the best result for Ireland. I am critical of the Government because it has asked the people for submissions on the treaty, yet it has not sent them the booklet explaining the treaty. A revised or toned down version of the White Paper, on whose clarity I compliment the Government, could be sent to every household in the country and submissions could then be invited. However, the Government has done it the other way around. It has asked for submissions first without sending people a copy of the documentation. That is profoundly wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, which came to office in 1997, has a different view of European affairs than the previous rainbow Government led by the former leader of my party, Deputy John Bruton. On its first day in office, the Government committed a cardinal error in terms of constitutional law by attempting to bring together key aspects of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence. That error goes to the heart of the problem this Government has with Europe. For the first time since the mid-1980s we do not have a European affairs Minister and that is a mistake. Deputy Quinn made the point last week that we still do not have full embassies to the accession countries to enhance the bilateral relationship with the Czech Republic and Hungary. That is also a mistake. The Government, at the time this debate was taking place in Nice, stupidly spun the notion, which the Taoiseach used as a kind of macho, eurosceptic argument to put to the people, that he held out to the last minute to ensure taxation matters would not be part of the treaty. Of course, Mr. Blair had also taken the exact same position and it was never really a threat. That kind of spin was not helpful in the debate that was taking place. We have seen just how exposed this Government is in terms of European affairs. We saw it some weeks ago when the Minister for Finance received a reprimand from his colleagues in ECOFIN in relation to budgetary matters. The Government parties, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, do not have the clout of mainstream political parties like Fine Gael and the Labour Party, who are involved in the European People's Party and the Social Democratic <Col N="1154" /> Party, respectively, and they cannot call on the Ministers and heads of Government of other countries to get them out of trouble. Problems emanate from the fact that the Government does not have collateral built up in other EU states, as a result of its negotiating position, and that is a cause of concern.</P>
    <P>A balance sheet of our involvement in the European Union would show that all the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Dramatic economic change has resulted from membership of the EU and that is something that we take for granted. We take for granted the fact that, since joining the European Economic Community in 1973, unbelievable growth in employment, economic capacity and opportunity has taken place. By its very definition, Europe must go forward. It began on the basis of an economic ideal and has grown to encompass a security ideal. If the European project is to be realised, there has to be movement forward and further integration. Of course, there has been a pooling of sovereignty and that has had its downside. Some powers are now outside the jurisdiction of this House in order to ensure that the European Union actually works. Those concessions are absolutely essential if we are to proceed to greater integration and freedom in Europe. We have European laws in respect of fundamental rights and many Irish women today have fundamental rights as a result of judgments of the European Court of Justice. We forget that tremendous benefit and such benefits need to be articulated and argued for in this debate.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the decision that larger states will give up their second Commissioner and if there are 27 member countries by the year 2005 we will have to revisit this issue. Some say the Government has given in on a key principle of the Commission whereby, if there is a membership of 27, commissionerships will be rotated. Small countries have rightly felt that having a Commissioner enables them to wield the kind of power that is required and, ultimately, the fact that this principle has been conceded could be to the detriment of this country in the long-term. One of the disappointments of the Nice Treaty is the extension of some 50 provisions whereby qualified majority voting is now required. If one looks at what has been extended, in Article 133(5), unlike the Maastricht Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty, the provisions are minimalist and those who negotiated the treaty have not got the goal of full European integration in mind. I hope those matters will be revisited.</P>
    <P>As the EU will have perhaps 20 members in five years' time, the European Parliament needs to become much more coherent. It cannot become too unwieldy as a result of the increased membership. Ireland will lose three seats, going from 15 members to 12, and I understand the reasoning behind that. If we are serious about establishing greater democratic control in Europe, the European Parliament has to have much greater controls and political parties need <Col N="1155" /> to put forward clearer plans. It is very difficult in a union of 15 countries, for the programmes of one, two or three political parties to be enforced in the European Parliament and have effect. Until full powers are given to the European Parliament, and Deputy John Bruton has spoken about this in respect of the election of the Commission, the democratic issue cannot be addressed in member states. People need to know that if they elect representatives to the European Parliament they are making decisions which affect their lives. Those elected to the Oireachtas make decisions which affect the lives of the electorate and the issue of the European Parliament having to extend its remit and control must be revisited.</P>
    <P>Once again, voices outside this House have told lies about the effects of provisions for a common foreign and security policy within the Nice Treaty. I fully support a European Union which not only can defend itself but can impose security in the region and within its borders. It is clear, from a reading of the White Paper, that there is a dumbing down of the Western European Union and that is something I fully understand. When the Maastricht Treaty was being put together, debated and put to the people there was a view that the Western European Union would be the main mechanism for the provision of security within the union. Since the establishment of the Rapid Reaction Force, members of the union will have to take much greater responsibility to provide security within the EU and the implications, in that context, will have to be reconsidered. There are very few changes and the most disappointing part of the treaty is the minimalist change to common foreign and security policy. It is something that future generations will have to revisit.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense to suggest that the provisions of Article 25, which allow for the newly established political and security committee, are somehow impinging on our neutrality. When one reads the article it is clear that many of the provisions are taken directly from the UN Charter. These are provisions which help the notion of peace, security and the establishment of fundamental rights. They have already been conceded by way of the Petersberg Tasks and will be essential if we want to avoid revisiting the appalling tragedy of Yugoslavia. In effect, it was the Americans, under the aegis of Sfor troops, who led the initial task force to that area, and all European citizens should hold their heads in shame as a result of what took place in Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>It is not right and proper for those who are opposing this amendment to the Constitution to suggest that it will mean a diminution of our neutral position or our security; it is nothing of the kind. Those of us who are in favour of this referendum and want to see it being passed, have an obligation to demolish the arguments being put forward by those who have been wrong on every <Col N="1156" /> single count since referenda on European Union matters were first held.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier we heard the very technical debate on Committee Stage of the Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. We are now dealing with a more wide ranging debate on Second Stage of the Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. I am sure we will be given some latitude in discussing various aspects of the legislation. I agree with Deputy Hayes about how important it is that the people should support the Treaty of Nice by voting for this referendum. I do not think they will receive any encouragement, however, from the side swipes that are being made against the Minister for Finance and other members of the Government. Such comments will not help to focus the public mind on the forthcoming referendum.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with people who express Nationalistic views; with our history it would be surprising if people did not have them. Such views do not have to be submerged. Irish people are enthusiastically pro European and have demonstrated that by the initial overwhelming vote in favour of European Community membership in 1973, which was subsequently confirmed by a vote in favour of the Single European Act in 1986, the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, and the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997.</P>
      <P>The attack on the Minister for Finance will have a detrimental effect on the public's approach to the referendum on the Treaty of Nice. We could argue over aspects of that matter forever but it will be seen by the public as interference in our domestic affairs. It is amazing that the financial advisers in nearly every member state of the EU have since ridiculed the attack that was made on the Minister for Finance. In the same way, the interference in Austria's internal affairs has made people there very cynical about the European Union. We have to be careful how we interfere in the autonomy of members states and in issues that should be dealt with by the member state concerned.</P>
      <P>If Members of other parties in the House &ndash; who are seeking support for the Treaty of Nice &ndash; use the debate to attack Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats, they will not be encouraging the public to support the treaty.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Nice builds on the undoubted economic, social and political success of the European Union. I wish to consider the elements of the treaty under four separate headings: the enlargement of the EU, enhanced co-operation between member states, the foreign policy and security implications of the treaty and the recognition of fundamental rights and principles of non-discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the enlargement of the EU, it is worth pointing out that there are currently 15 member states, of which Ireland was the seventh to join, with over 370 million citizens. Following the collapse of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the liberation of those countries, it <Col N="1157" /> was only to be expected that they would one day seek to join the EU. As far back as 1990, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, recognised this possibility when he called a special European Summit in Dublin at which the process of admitting emerging democracies in eastern Europe was begun. Twelve new member states are likely to be admitted over the next ten years, including Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. These new members will provide huge additional tariff free economic opportunities from exporting nations such as ours, as well as adding to the cultural richness and diversity of the member states.</P>
    <P>We cannot over-stress the importance or impact of the economic change that will occur because we will have far greater export markets for Irish products. Traditionally, we were totally subservient to the United Kingdom in trading matters. Initially, some people scoffed at the idea of diversifying and trading with mainland Europe but we have been able to achieve that goal. Our export markets will now be extended though EU enlargement which will bring benefits for everybody.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, as a country whose development has been enormously enhanced by our membership of the EU, we are being provided with a chance to afford a similar opportunity to these new democracies. The fundamental decision to be made by the people when voting on this referendum is whether we want to extend to the people of those countries the same opportunities we enjoyed following our entry to the first Common Market. It is important to emphasise that that is the main decision to be made concerning the Treaty of Nice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Opponents of the treaty can put any spin they wish on its component parts but the basic question is whether we say yes or no to the millions of people in the applicant states who are looking to us for support. I am extremely concerned about the implications should the referendum on the Treaty of Nice fail to be carried, and I am sure other speakers will spell that out also. It is important to inform the public that Ireland is the only country proceeding with a referendum on the treaty.</P>
      <P>The process raises the relative influence Ireland can exert in the context of an enlarged EU. The Government has successfully retained our right to nominate a commissioner until the number of member states reaches 27, at which point the matter will be reviewed. Deputy Hayes seemed to belittle that battle to maintain our right to nominate a commissioner but I laud the efforts by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other Cabinet members in achieving that. We should point out the fact to the public that we have maintained the right to a commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has been well served by its European <Col N="1158" /> Commissioners, including Deputy O'Kennedy &ndash; who is the last surviving link in the House with the original Council of Ministers in 1973 &ndash; Peter Sutherland, Ray MacSharry, Padraig Flynn and the current commissioner, Mr. David Byrne.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not let a doctrinal approach to party politics get in my way, so I did mention Mr. Sutherland. I am confident that the quality of our representation on the European Commission will guarantee our continued influence despite the concerns of Deputy Hayes. Concern has been expressed about the reduction in the number of our MEPs from 15 to 12 and the change in their voting strength in the Council of Ministers from three out of 87 to seven out of 237. That concern is not valid. Numerically speaking, we did not ever have the ability to decide the outcome of votes in our own right, with the obvious exception of the possibility of using the power of veto, yet we have always had our needs respected and have always been able to lobby successfully in our national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the enlarged community, there is the possibility of the decision making process being endangered by the requirement to have unanimity on all issues. It is sensible that qualified majority voting would be extended across a wide range of issues where it does not pose a threat to fundamental national interests. It was not a demonstration of macho power that led to the Taoiseach fighting this battle, as was suggested by the previous speaker. The fundamental national interest, as far as this Government is concerned, must be the preservation of our hugely successful low corporate and personal tax regime. It is the cornerstone of our economic success and has to be defended. One manifestation of the success in that regard is that we have won more than 25% <Col N="1159" /> of all mobile US economic investment over the past three years. That was not a demonstration of an Irish macho approach by the Taoiseach. It was a very successful campaign and a successful outcome to an important aspect of our economic approach to affairs, and we won that one.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate that the Commission ham-fistedly reprimanded Ireland for our budgetary policy. It would be disastrous if that exercise influenced people negatively towards this treaty as the Government has successfully retained the need for unanimity in matters of taxation. The danger now is that the poorer countries that are lined up for entry into the EU could be deprived of the opportunity we enjoyed because of that offensive effort by the Commission. There was a hidden agenda in that attack.</P>
    <P>The interesting aspect of that reprimand is that, individually, many of the participants seem to accept that it was totally misplaced and economic commentators in the participating countries have ridiculed the exercise. Fine Gael or Labour spokespersons may not agree but that is the international approach and they will have to recognise that. Despite that hiccup in our relations &ndash; and I believe many members of the Commission regret their extraordinary reprimand given our huge budget surplus and relative economic performance &ndash; we cannot argue against the enormous benefit of our membership and we should promote the extension of the Union. Enlargement offers the same benefits to the countries coming in as well as additional trade opportunities and cultural diversities to the existing members, and I strongly support that approach.</P>
    <P>On the enhanced co-operation between member states, as the number of member states increases there will be enhanced need for flexibility in the operation of the institutions of the Union. In this regard, it is to be welcomed that a treaty allows for groups of member states, fewer than the entire membership of the Union, to avail of the institutions of the Union to promote closer co-operation between them. It is a geographical and historical fact that groupings will have traded together, worked together and will have cultural similarities that will tend to knit them closer than many other states, so it is an important provision.</P>
    <P>On the foreign policy and security implications of the treaty, referred to by Deputy Hayes, this is the area about which the anti-Euro members will try to confuse people. Ireland has a strong interest in maintaining a stable, inclusive security environment. It is imperative to allow the Community to develop its humanitarian and crisis management capabilities. Participation by Ireland in such tasks would be a sovereign decision by the Government and would be considered on a case by case basis. In line with our policy of military neutrality, Ireland would participate only in operations authorised by the United Nations in accordance with the appropriate legislation and subject to Dáil approval.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hayes that we cannot be <Col N="1160" /> bystanders in the face of genocide or the flouting of human rights. We witnessed the annoyance and the frustration of the public when there were delays in getting involved in several such happenings in the past. That public expression forced Governments to take action in several situations. I would be concerned that we would be open and frank with the public on all issues related to security and explain fully to them what is happening.</P>
    <P>The detail in this treaty need not pose concern for us. The new political and security committee would be established under the terms of the treaty and will be charged with safeguarding the common values, fundamental interests, independence and integrity of the EU in conformity with the principles of the UN charter; preserving peace and strengthening international security; promoting international co-operation; developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law; and respecting human rights. What is of vital importance, however, is the provision of the Maastricht Treaty, unaltered by the Nice Treaty, that security co-operation shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states. That is a critical statement in the Maastricht Treaty and if Deputy Hayes or anybody else wants to alter that and go further, they should follow public debate. However, I do not want this issue to be used to turn people against giving the opportunity to millions of other people to join with us. We can be assured that our position outside of any military alliance is respected while strengthening the capability of the Community to help preserve peace.</P>
    <P>On the recognition of fundamental rights and the principle of non-discrimination, over the years the European Union has been to the forefront in the international recognition of human rights. It is too easy to take for granted the principle of democracy, adherence to the rule of law and respect for human rights. For many people on the European continent, these benefits are a recent phenomenon and may not yet be available to them. That is why it is vitally important that every country seeking membership of the Community must sign up to these principles to ensure practical application of them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for a mechanism in the treaty for the Union to respond when there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a member state of the basic principles on which they are based. That is important and it will give us a foothold into countries in which we have not been able to get involved for political or other reasons up to now and it will give us an opportunity, along with the other EU states, to promote the concept of good human conditions, benefits and all that goes with that. The EU has been a leading force for improvement in the quality of life of people both inside and outside the Community and its continued attention to this area as outlined in the treaty is very much welcomed.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by people will have to be dealt with as they arise. On the question of neu<Col N="1161" /> trality, people will try to confuse the public as they did in the past. We will have to emphasise the humanitarian aspect of this, the benefits and the opportunities we want to extend to others and the reasons we believe it would be good for people to have the opportunity given to us.</P>
    <P>An important aspect is that if we vote against this measure, the treaty falls. That is significant. On representation, we can tell the people that only Luxembourg will have a higher number of seats per population ratio than Ireland. That is important from commercial and cultural aspects because the treaty will enhance the original hope and concept of the founders of the Union, namely, to foster peace through partnership. That is what started in Paris a long time ago and the concept is being enhanced by this extension. People who are trading and working together do not make war. That is the hope and this measure will help that.</P>
    <P>In its approach the treaty balances the interests of applicant countries seeking to join the EU while addressing the concerns of smaller member states. I would be as concerned about the far right movements throughout Europe as the previous speaker but I do not want to compare Irish Nationalists with some of the activities of the people we have seen. I will defend my right to be a democratic Nationalist at all times.</P>

      <P>I am a Nationalist and proud of it. I am in this Chamber because my party decided to engage in the democratic process many years ago. However, I take the points made by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the continued evolution of the European Union as outlined in the Treaty of Nice. Ireland has benefited enormously from its membership of the Union and we can now help to extend those benefits to the new democracies of eastern Europe. There is no doubt that there will be additional trade opportunities as well as increased cultural diversity. Concerns about Ireland's loss of influence are misplaced. Ireland has demonstrated that its relative size is no obstacle to taking its place on the world stage, as demonstrated by its membership of the United Nations Security Council. I look forward to a strong endorsement of the treaty in the forthcoming referendum.</P>
      <P>Like other Members, I am concerned that a number of referenda will take place on the same day. I never underestimate, however, the intelligence of members of the electorate. I am proud to endorse the Bill and recommend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my party leader, I state categorically that the Labour Party supports the Treaty of Nice. There are, however, elements to it &ndash; not least the fact that the principle of one Commissioner per country is not enshrined in its provisions &ndash; with which we would have a difficulty.</P>
      <P>Let me refer to the exchange between Deputies Dennehy and Bruton in relation to Jörg Haider. In 1992 I visited Salzburg when the presidential election campaign, in which Jörg Haider was supporting one of the candidates &ndash; though not one from his party &ndash; was taking place. I attended a rally on a Friday evening in a square in Salzburg in the company of someone who could translate for me and was struck by the atmosphere. I found Mr. Haider's delivery electric. What he said appeared to affect the entire audience, which was frightening. The translator told me that part of Mr. Haider's speech essentially dealt with immigration and the influx from eastern Europe. Mr. Haider inquired if socialists would take the people concerned into their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience in Austria prompted me to consider a number of issues. At the time in question neo-Nazism had reared its head in France and <Col N="1163" /> Bavaria. When I was younger I became fascinated with the Second World War, fascism in particular. I was interested in fascism in the sense that I found it difficult to comprehend how a regime as awful as that which came to power in Nazi Germany could have developed. It was difficult to understand how that regime could oversee the Holocaust, in which over six million people were exterminated because they belonged to a particular ethnic group. It was also difficult to understand how the intelligentsia, the judiciary and virtually every pillar of Germany society colluded with Nazism, which was frightening. In my innocence I came to believe that we would never again witness such events in Europe. That proved not to be the case, however, because the worst excesses of the terrible Nazi regime were recalled in the past decade in the Former Yugoslavia where we witnessed ethnic cleansing, concentration camps and any number of horrific brutalities.</P>
    <P>In the late 1930s people from my constituency went to fight on both sides in the Spanish Civil War. Obviously, my sympathies would have been with those of the left who joined the International Brigade in order to fight fascism. The people concerned were before their time in that they foresaw where the conflict in Spain was leading. The horrific bombing of Guernica gave those alive at the time a preview of the sort of war that was going to occur in Europe.</P>
    <P>With the exception of those Irish people who travelled to Spain in 1936 and who joined the British Army to fight in both World Wars, Ireland was not directly involved in the major conflicts that shook Europe. When I was young I recall people having ration books because many food products, etc., were in short supply. Ireland was not exposed, however, to the terrible events which took place on the Continent or in Britain where, for example, people in the larger cities were obliged to live through the Blitz. The EEC came into being because of the huge shortage of food in the aftermath of both world wars, but particularly the Second World War. The Common Agricultural Policy, which has been good for Ireland, developed as the EEC developed.</P>
    <P>There is one reason above all others that I support the Treaty of Nice. We face a situation where, in time, the membership of the European Union will increase from 15 to 27. The most spectacular success of the European Union has been that no major war involving the traditional protagonists &ndash; the United Kingdom, France and Germany &ndash; has occurred on the Continent for over 50 years. The European Union, as an entity, has worked in that peace has reigned on a continent where two world wars occurred during the earlier part of the last century. If we can contribute in any way to furthering the cause of peace in Europe and putting behind us forever the possibility of military confrontation, we should do so. It will be possible to do so within the context of EU enlargement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> The most fundamental and important reason for supporting the Treaty of Nice is that enlargement will foster peace and stability and reduce human suffering. It is staggering to think that when Europe increases from 15 to 27 members states its population will reach 500 million. There are problems with the economies of the aspiring member states. I am critical of some Ministers who want to promote the idea of the begging bowl and the fact that all that matters is what we get from Europe.</P>
    <P>When my party leader spoke on the Treaty of Nice he referred to an Irish forum on the future of Europe. I recall speaking at a forum in Waterford at the time we were discussing the Maastricht Treaty, which was a large tome. I said there had not been an effective and all-inclusive debate on the issue. There has been little change since then. Deputy Quinn modelled his proposal for an Irish forum on the future of Europe on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which made us examine our views and helped to mould public opinion so it was possible to make substantial changes to our Constitution in the context of the Good Friday Agreement. This forum would be for our citizens and for anyone who has something substantial to offer on how to develop our attitudes towards Europe. Our attitudes are not as mature as they could be. Although membership of the EU has meant we have become a more open and outward looking society, we still have a long way to go. We must ask ourselves if we want to follow the model of Boston or that of Berlin. Do we want the same type of economy as the US, which is market driven and where there is not the same emphasis on social inclusion and caring as in Europe? We are part of the European model.</P>
    <P>We do not have sufficient debate on politics or political issues. I know the profession of politics has become discredited in this country and there is an onus on all of us to change that. There is a difficulty in that more young people are disengaging from the democratic system. We must develop our vision of how Ireland should interface with the EU and how we should become more involved. It is important to look at our role as contributors. We should grow the linkages we have with the aspiring member states and cultivate new ones where they do not already exist because we have a great deal to offer. It could be said we were late joining the EEC. There were six member states when we joined on 1 January 1973 with Great Britain and Denmark. Membership of the EU has been good for this country in terms of the development of our infrastructure and of a sound economy, despite some current difficulties. We can consult, advise and have discussions with the aspiring member states about their participation and the economic developments which are possible within the EU.</P>
    <P>One issue we already face, which I referred to when I mentioned Jörg Haider, is that people from different nations and with different cultures are coming to live in our country. We are <Col N="1165" /> developing a multi-cultural society. We must maximise the positive effects of that and look on this growth in cultural diversity as an opportunity. We should not look at it in a negative way. There will be new languages in the EU and this may make communication difficult. We must deal with these issues in our own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>If we establish the forum, it must be open and frank. While it may be distasteful for some people to use it, they should feel free to make their views known to the forum. If we broaden the debate on Europe, we will become better Europeans and we will see Europe in a broader context. The fact we were not directly involved in the world wars in the last century meant we missed out on an experience which would have shown us the devastating effects of war.</P>
    <P>I understand the date for the referendum is 7 June and that ratification will take place in December 2002. The intergovernmental conference will be held in 2004, which may coincide with the Irish Presidency. We must have an inclusive nation-wide debate so we have a broader understanding of Europe and our role in Europe. If we do that, we will understand ourselves better and we will be able to make a greater contribution to Europe and to the difficulties which may arise.</P>
    <P>Adolf Hitler is rightly blamed for the extermination of six million people just because they were Jews. However, behind the Iron Curtain, under Josef Stalin an estimated 30 million people were exterminated in Russia. This is a frightening statistic. The same was not true in the other nations of the old USSR. When Mikhail Gorbachev arrived, the Iron Curtain fell and we saw an end to cold war politics. There is another aspect to that that does not get sufficient focus. The Cold War was not effective in bringing about peace in Europe. It was the old Coal and Steel Union and then the EEC and the EU that achieved peace.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be supporting the Treaty of Nice. The Labour Party has been pro Europe for many years although I must confess that, in 1972, I spent six weeks knocking on the doors in Waterford advising people that they should not vote for entry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always better to say it up front. One of the major concerns I had was that I thought that the old traditional industries would not survive in the European market. To a large extent, that did happen. However, other industrial development took place and the wider market gave us greater opportunity. We need to look at our competitiveness but the 500 million people market presents a great opportunity for Ireland. I enthusiastically support the treaty in spite of the fact that there are some strong reservations. These can be addressed in an ongoing process, <Col N="1166" /> ideally through the Irish Forum on the Future Europe as proposed by my party leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of contributing to this important debate. The purpose of the Nice Treaty is to make the changes necessary to prepare the European Union for enlargement. Ireland is a committed member of the EU and a keen advocate of the enlargement process. It is important, therefore, that Ireland ratify the Nice Treaty.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy O'Shea, there is no lack of opportunity for debate in the public arena. The European Institute has done a great job throughout the country. I have seen some very good forums with excellent speakers. The tragedy is the small number of people who bother to turn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>He could do that. The Deputy knows that I am a committed &ldquo;Europeanist&rdquo;, if I may put it that way. I have always responded to debates on the European Union and have travelled around the country to do so. I believe that Ireland has played a very important role in shaping Europe.</P>
      <P>Some members of the public are asking why we need to hold yet another referendum. In ratifying the Nice Treaty, the Attorney General has advised that a referendum is necessary in order that legal certainty will prevail in certain matters of importance, relating to foreign policy and voting rights within the EU, which are set out in the Treaty. It is, therefore, important that we should turn out in large numbers to vote in the referendum.</P>
      <P>This referendum is an opportunity for people to show their support for the European Union and for Ireland's attachment to Europe, which has been, and is, very good for Ireland. As we are the only country that will have a referendum on the Nice Treaty, we alone in Europe have the opportunity to give it popular democratic endorsement. The Nice Treaty is the gateway to enlargement of the European Union. This is an opportunity for Irish people to show their support for enlargement and for freedom and democracy throughout Europe. I have no doubt that the people will vote in favour of the treaty and thereby support the next stage in the Union's development. This Union is our Union and we all must take our share of the responsibility for its further development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice is the result of an intergovernmental conference, which began early last year and which concluded with the nego<Col N="1167" /> tiations at the Nice European Council last December. The Intergovernmental Conference was set the task of dealing with what were termed &ldquo;the Amsterdam leftovers&rdquo;. These leftovers were the major institutional reforms within the Union needed to cope with an enlarged Union which had not been resolved as part of the Treaty of Amsterdam. The institutional changes were successfully agreed at Nice.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the Nice Treaty is effectively a gateway to the enlargement of the Union. It does this by making the institutional changes necessary to prepare the Union for enlargement. It guarantees that a Union of 27 members will be in a position to operate effectively while, at the same time, making sure that the essential safeguards for smaller countries remain in place.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the enlargement process. Our perspective on enlargement is very much informed by our positive experiences of EU membership. We can understand, possibly more than most because of our own history and development, the hopes that the applicant states invest in their accession to the EU. We welcome the diversity and strength which enlargement will bring to the EU as a whole, and to all its individual member states.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House is aware of the volume of people coming in from the emerging countries in eastern and central Europe to Ireland. There have been numerous industrial, business and parliamentary delegations to both the Department of Finance and to parliamentary committees. We need to tell them that they cannot simply take the Irish model and suddenly place it in one of their countries. Their circumstances, requirements and stage of social and political development are very different to ours. There are core principles in what Ireland has done that will be very valuable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it actually took Ireland 50 years to become an overnight success?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much truth in that. When talking of our involvement in the European Union, we tend to look at the last few years. We forget that we have been there since 1973, which is almost 30 years. It has been a long process. The positive effect of many years of being almost in isolation built up a credibility and contact base, particularly in the United States, which eventually came to fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have much to contribute from our Civil Service structure. Our civil servants played an enormous role in developing our prosperity. While Europe developed general programmes, we had the imagination to unlock them and put them into a very specific context. It is fundamental that the good governance of a civil service structure in the emerging central European countries must be in place if they are to deliver the sort of success Ireland has achieved. I have tried <Col N="1168" /> to emphasise that point whether speaking here or internationally. I believe in that very firmly.  We are being encouraged in our support for the Nice Treaty by countries who are currently applying for membership of the EU. Ireland sees the applicant countries for the current enlargement of the EU as having the same motivation and desires for freedom, security and prosperity which led to our own application for membership of the EU. The aspiration to be part of a stronger and more prosperous Europe is held not just by those applicant countries but also by Ireland. A vote in favour of the Nice Treaty is a vote of solidarity for the countries in eastern and central Europe for whom membership of the EU is a guarantee of freedom and democracy.</P>
    <P>Ireland has made, and continues to make, deliberate efforts to promote stronger relationships with the applicant countries. My Department currently has two officials working as pre-accession advisers under the EU-sponsored twinning programmes in Estonia and Slovenia. Through these and other bilateral contacts we are sharing our expertise and past experience in the area of structural funds and membership of the EU in general with the accession countries.</P>
    <P>In promoting the growth and development of the Union we are also promoting our own national interest. The Union has been good for Ireland. On all previous occasions we have endorsed the various stages in the development of the Union through the referendum process. Ireland is well placed to take advantage of the benefits offered by an enlarged Union. Enlargement will provide opportunities for Ireland to deepen our relations both political and economic with the candidate countries, many of which are of a similar size to ourselves.</P>
    <P>Later, I will come back to some of the very tangible economic and financial benefits we have drawn from the Union. I also remind the House of some of the benefits we might be more inclined at times to take for granted. Free access to the single market of the Union is probably the greatest economic benefit we draw from the Union. As a small and very open trading economy it is vital that we preserve and strengthen this access. The expansion of the single market by more than one hundred million new consumers will create many new customers for our goods and services. Our exporters will have access to a single market with more than 500 million people. Our ability to export into the single market is a prime attraction for the many foreign firms that have established their operations in Ireland and our attractiveness as a location for foreign direct investment can only be enhanced by the increase in the single market which will result from enlargement. We made a very quick mental jump in realising that we had a market of 375 million people to exploit instead of a 3.5 million people market. We have done that very successfully.</P>
    <P>The already impressive level of Irish investment in the candidate countries by some of our biggest companies will also be facilitated further <Col N="1169" /> in what are now rapidly expanding economies. As Minister of State in the Department of Finance I naturally welcome these developments but besides expanding the market we are also deepening the market to further facilitate trade within the market area. Perhaps the most visible sign of this will be the introduction in Ireland and across 11 of the other member states of the euro currency notes and coins from the beginning of next year.</P>
    <P>Membership of the euro has brought other benefits too. The convergence criteria carefully laid down at Maastricht ensured that all participating states kept deficits, inflation and interest rates tightly controlled, measures which facilitated the healthy development of our public finances, while providing a stable environment for business. I will refer later to Structural Funds in general. At this point it is timely that we remind ourselves of the significant financial contribution the European Union has made to the peace process on this island. First, by contributing to the International Fund for Ireland after the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1986 and, second, following the ceasefires in 1994, by its support for the Border region and Northern Ireland through the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. Many Deputies will know the work that has been supported in the Border counties by both of these programmes. The Programme for Peace and Reconciliation was the response of our European neighbours at a very critical time. Deputies will rightly recall the enthusiasm that greeted the paramilitary ceasefires in August 1994.</P>
    <P>The programme aims to reinforce progress towards a peaceful and stable society and to advance reconciliation. It does this through locally based actions, promoting urban and rural regeneration, developing cross-Border co-operation, extending social inclusion and promoting and stimulating economic activity and employment. Deputies will recall the pace with which the European Commission moved to underpin the emerging process that has given us nearly seven years of peace on this island. Within months of the ceasefires, the Commission created a task force to look into the ways the European Union could help and make a practical expression of solidarity to the process of peace building on this island. The Commission concluded at that time, and again in recent times, that the European Union had a clear interest and a vital role to play in maintaining the momentum for peace and reconciliation, not only for the region most affected, but also for the European Union as a whole. This is very important not just on this island but in other areas of Europe which are being challenged in our aspiration to become part of the European Union by how we deal with such matters. Deputies from Border constituencies can testify in a fuller manner than I, as to the impact of the peace programme.</P>
    <P>This new round of EU support for the peace process will continue the work begun in com<Col N="1170" /> munities in towns and villages all along the Border, and on both sides of it. It will continue its work of encouraging reconciliation, building a meaningful peace and generating confidence, both social and economic. It will continue to invest in the people of the Border region. Investing in education, in youth services and in enabling communities reach out to communities with similar problems and issues in Northern Ireland. It will help sustain the cross-Border contacts so carefully nurtured under the first programme. One significant feature of the peace programme is the &ldquo;people dimension&rdquo; which has provided the means for people, organisations and whole communities to explore relationships with their counterparts across the Border. Something hard to imagine a few years ago is now commonplace. I cannot speak with authority about the impact of the programme in Northern Ireland. However, my strong impression is that the programme has had similar significant impacts in the North.</P>
    <P>This new programme of support makes up nearly one third of the North's Structural Funds plan &ndash; making a enormous contribution to the rebuilding of the Northern Ireland economy. The House might like to know that by the end of this year the first EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation will have invested some £106 million in the economy of the Border region. The Northern Ireland economy will have received support of more than £450 million from the same programme. Some £80 million will have been spent in the six years ending the end of 2001 on supported cross-Border co-operative initiatives. Deputies will know of the variety of cross-Border activities that are being funded. However, it is important that we are reminded that peace building and reconciliation takes place at several different levels and not always with a diplomatic flourish.</P>
    <P>Similar levels of funding have been committed by the EU to the second programme which will run until the end of 2004. Both the Border region and Northern Ireland benefit from the EU's Community Initiatives Programmes. In particular, the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG programmes have contributed to generating high quality cross-Border interactivity at public and private sector level. This has secured more strategic approaches on both sides of the Border to common areas of interest, has helped to create and secure employment, and improved the Border area's competitiveness. Also under the EU's community initiatives programmes a new Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG programme is expected to begin operations later this year. In all, it will contribute more than 170 million euro to the Border regions, North and South, by the end of 2006.</P>
    <P>I will now outline some of the outcomes of the Nice Summit resulting in the treaty which the Irish people will be asked to ratify in the near future. One of Ireland's key priorities in the negotiations leading up to the Nice Treaty was <Col N="1171" /> that we would maintain the right to decide our own policy in the area of taxation. This objective was successfully achieved. All decisions in this area will continue to be made by unanimous voting procedures and not qualified majority. There must be competition within the EU member states. To try to harmonise everything throughout Europe would be detrimental to the wellbeing of Europe and its development.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that Ireland will be forced to relinquish its right to nominate an EU commissioner. When the next EU Commission is established, each member state will have one commissioner, until such time as EU membership reaches a total of 27 member states. A key point within this is that the five big members states Germany, France, UK, Italy and Spain have given up their right to nominate a second commissioner. When the Union reaches 27 &ndash; and this may not happen for another ten years &ndash; there will be a rotation system. At that time a decision will be taken to limit the size of the Commission somewhere below the level of EU membership. However, any decision on this issue will have to be unanimous and will be based on strict equality between all member states. Furthermore, such a limit will be accompanied by arrangements for strict equal rotation among member states of their right to nominate a commissioner so that, for example, the number of times Ireland is represented on the Commission will equal the number of times that, say, France or Germany is represented. This important guarantee is one on which Ireland insisted at the Nice Summit.</P>
    <P>As part of the deal for giving up their second commissioner, the larger states have had their voting weight increased. Ireland's voting weight is only marginally affected, and remains the same as that of Finland and Denmark. In addition, an important safeguard agreed at Nice is that decisions must have the support of a majority of member states. This is a valuable protection for smaller states.</P>
    <P>The outcome on the European Parliament was also satisfactory. With 12 seats, we will continue to have a better ratio of seats to population than any existing member state except Luxembourg. Another gain was that the right of each member state to nominate a judge to the Court of Justice has been confirmed in the treaty for the first time. As regards the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Treaty of Nice includes some limited necessary updating of provisions for putting into effect the decisions on humanitarian and crisis management tasks agreed in Amsterdam. There is no departure from the firm commitment, in line with the Government's policy of neutrality, that Ireland would participate only in operations authorised by the United Nations, in accordance with the appropriate legislation and subject to Dáil approval. The focus is clearly on peacekeeping and crisis management tasks, participation in <Col N="1172" /> which will be a voluntary and sovereign decision in every case.</P>
    <P>Enhanced co-operation will not relate to matters having military or defence implications. Such matters will continue to be decided by unanimity. Enhanced co-operation could apply in the CFSP, but only in relation to the implementation of measures agreed in CFSP. The proposed EU rapid reaction force will not be a standing army as others would have us believe. This fact has been recognised in the conclusions of successive European Councils. The EU is not seeking to assume the role of NATO. The Rapid Reaction Force will ensure the availability of a pool of capabilities to provide the means of carrying out the Petersberg Tasks.</P>
    <P>Participation by member states in any humanitarian or crisis management tasks which may be undertaken by the EU will remain the sovereign decision of their Governments. Thus, an objective assessment of the relatively limited changes proposed by the Treaty of Nice must be that Ireland has nothing to fear and much to gain from equipping the Union to face the challenges ahead.</P>
    <P>Ireland's experience of the European Union has been an extremely positive one. I agree with Deputy O'Shea that our involvement in Europe was not based on a begging bowl mentality. That was an appalling approach and should not have been put across as it was. Ireland has made a major contribution to the development of the European Union people. If the idea of raising all boats and transferring wealth from the centre of the Union to the periphery was to be achieved, Ireland had the right to pursue that to the fullest degree, as we did. Ireland proved that the model set up in Europe could deliver to the peripheral areas. It was legitimate to seek the transfer of funds to achieve that. This was a catalyst within our economy.</P>
    <P>Equally, I do not agree with the premise that finances from Europe are responsible for where we are today. They are not. The finances were an important feature of the development of fiscal and budgetary policy through successive Governments. Collectively, successive Governments have used those resources widely but this was necessary so that Europe could become a balanced community where the standard of living was equalised for all its peoples. To me that is a fundamental principle of what the EU is about. Those who aspire to enlargement do so on the basis of that equality and of raising standards as well as the underlying principles of freedom and democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is vital that Dáil Éireann and the people ratify the Treaty of Nice in the referendum that will be held on 6 June. Ireland is the only EU country to have a referendum on that treaty. This is because in 1972 the Dáil decided that any new treaties agreed by Ireland in an EU context would only be protected against constitutional challenge by the original decision of the people in the referendum if they were &ldquo;necessi<Col N="1173" /> tated&rdquo; by EU membership. Originally, the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, wanted the constitutional protection against challenge to extend to treaties that were &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; EU membership but the term &ldquo;necessitated&rdquo; was added with his agreement. This means that, uniquely, the Irish people have the power to stop the entire EU train at any station on its future route.</P>
      <P>This inordinate, exceptional, and arguably anomalous power is one that the people must exercise with great responsibility. I was critical of the Treaty of Nice in the House last December but I recommend that it be accepted because Ireland's wider responsibility is to the peaceful development of Europe. We must respect the needs of other European peoples less fortunate than we are, less fortunate than we have been for a long time.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil last December I criticised the fact that once EU membership exceeds 27 states, some countries will cease to have a Commissioner. This may seem a good distance away but when one takes into account the fact that there are over 40 European countries, it is a position that will definitely be reached. After that point there will come a five year term in which Ireland will have no Commissioner. That will be serious in terms of political legitimacy and acceptability in Ireland of Commission proposals and decisions, but it could be argued that Ireland, as a small country, could not go it alone anyway and will accept Commission decisions even though there is no Irish person on the Commission.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the same argument applies to Germany, and that is the big flaw in the treaty. Under the Treaty of Nice, the time will come when the 90 million Germans, potentially 20% of the EU population, will be governed by a Commission of 27 people among which there will not be one German. That is not politically viable and the one Commissioner per member state rule will have to be restored and the treaty reversed. It is particularly a problem for Germany, not just for small countries. Germany is too big not to have a Commissioner. The same is true of France to a lesser degree.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that a 40-member Commission is unworkable. Once the excellent reforms in the Treaty of Nice, to enhance the role of Commission President and give substantial power to reallocate portfolios and organise the internal work of the Commission, are put into effect, it does not matter what is the number of Commissioners. The work can be organised by the strengthened Presidency. The British Government has more than 40 Ministers and the Commission should work equally well with large numbers. Those who have been promoting difficulties have little political or administrative imagination. I do not believe the argument in favour of retaining a Commissioner per nation state is one that is only of relevance to small states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding these reservations, let me explain why I believe it is vital that the people <Col N="1174" /> ratify the treaty on 7 June. It is vital because, without ratification, there can be no enlargement of the European Union to include Cyprus, Malta, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania. Many of those are countries, like Ireland, which came into existence as parliamentary democracies in the wake of the First World War. However, due to economic pressures, political isolation, nationalistic xenophobia and war, they ceased to be democracies in the 1930s. Communism took over in 1945 and kept most of these countries in its thrall for 45 long miserable years. The prospect of EU membership, which will reduce economic pressures, end political isolation, counter nationalistic xenophobia and prevent war, is vital to underpin and guarantee the continuance of parliamentary democracy in these countries. That is what will be at stake when the people vote on 7 June. They will decide on that date whether such privileges will be extended to those about whom some of us know comparatively little. Who are we to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to them as far as EU membership is concerned? If we say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the Treaty of Nice, we are effectively saying that the Latvians, the Estonians, the Hungarians and the Poles are not entitled to enjoy the privileges we have enjoyed for so long.</P>
    <P>As a nation fortunate enough to enjoy continuous parliamentary democracy since acquiring statehood in 1921, Ireland has a responsibility to allow the European Union to accept these countries into EU membership by ratifying the Treaty of Nice. It is true that Ireland's individual weight in EU decisions will be reduced as a result of enlargement. If the membership of any club is increased, the individual power of existing members is proportionately reduced. That is the nature of democracy and it applies in a Gaelic football club or any other organisation. All existing EU members, including the big states, will also see their individual power proportionately reduced. The changes in the Treaty of Nice in the voting weights in the European Council and Parliament are an inevitable and necessary consequence of enlarged membership.</P>
    <P>There will be those who will oppose ratification of the Treaty of Nice. Opposing referenda gives some groups an opportunity to receive notice they would not receive and, perhaps, would not deserve in any other context. To those who will oppose the treaty I put this challenge, do you believe that the European Union should remain a smug western European rich nations' club, keeping the Poles, the Hungarians and people in the Baltic countries outside its doors? Do you remember or have you ever been told of the sufferings of the Polish people who, proportionately, lost more of their population in the Second World War than any other nation? Do you remember or have you ever been told of the sympathetic outpourings of the Irish people when Hungarian refugees arrived here in 1956 after the suppression of the rising against communism? Do you remember or have you ever been told of the <Col N="1175" /> way in which three countries, which gained their independence in the same year as Ireland &ndash; Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia &ndash; were wiped off the map in a cynical deal made in August 1939 between Hitler and Stalin, von Ribbentrop and Molotov? Do you believe that these people should be kept waiting at the door when there is room for them in the European Union?</P>
    <P>Some, those proclaiming their Christianity and Catholicism, will oppose the Treaty of Nice. To them I say: have you never heard of Cardinal Mindszenty of Hungary or Cardinal Wyszynski of Poland who fought for their countries' freedom? These same countries now have a chance to underpin their liberties and protect their human rights, including the right of religious practice, by joining the European Union. Is Ireland to tell them there is no room for them at the inn?</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Nice is not the last word on EU institutional reform. I hope one of the Nice reforms &ndash; the ultimate ending of one Commissioner per state &ndash; will be reversed before it takes effect. There is still time to do so. It was agreed at Nice that the following further four issues would be examined: the delimitation of the respective powers of the Union and the states; the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the treaty; the simplification of the treaty and the enhancement of the role of national parliaments. There is one very important and glaring omission from this agenda, but before I come to it, I will refer briefly to the above items.</P>
    <P>The attempt to delimit the respective powers of the Union and the member states will prove to be an impossible and time-wasting exercise. The reality is that there is shared responsibility between the Union and member states in virtually every area of governmental activity. Hardly any area of governmental activity is the exclusive preserve of a member state or the Union. This list will either be as long as a telephone directory or contain meaningless and valueless abstractions. A new delimitation of respective powers will introduce artificial difficulties in the smooth functioning of the Union and member states alike and create an expensive playground for lawyers. Lawyers will be able to go to the Irish courts to object to something the Union is doing and the European courts to object to something Ireland is doing. Delimitation will set back the process of European integration. There are far better ways of reassuring citizens that the Union will act in their interests and with their consent than could ever be provided for in this artificial list of respective functions, a list which it will prove impossible to formulate in any intellectual or workable manner.</P>
    <P>I also envisage dangers in incorporating the new Charter of Fundamental Rights in the treaty. If this happens, it will create a direct conflict of jurisdiction in regard to fundamental rights between our Supreme Court and the European Court. There is no reasonable ground on which to fear, as some claim, that the European Union <Col N="1176" /> could force Ireland to introduce abortion in certain circumstances, for example. However, if the new Charter of Fundamental Rights is incorporated in the treaty, this could make room for two different interpretations of fundamental rights to be created, one in the Supreme Court through the invocation of the Constitution and another in the European Court through the invocation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights included in the treaty. That could undermine fundamental rights as defined in the Constitution. That would be a backwards step for Ireland and Europe as a whole. Most other European countries have not developed their fundamental constitutional rights to the same level as Ireland. The best course of action for them to adopt is to create stronger fundamental rights provisions in their own constitutions. We should not take the shortcut of trying to do this for them by means of the EU treaties. To the extent that fundamental rights issues are to be dealt with at all at EU level, they should be dealt with by political means, not through the EU courts.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the major omission from the agenda for further work outlined at Nice. That omission is the question of how to enhance the political legitimacy of the European Union among the general population of all member states. There is a crisis of legitimacy among the electorate in most countries in terms of EU actions. The omission of this issue from the explicit agenda for the next Intergovernmental Conference is an indication that the statesmen and women who gathered in Nice were out of touch. This omission will become more important, the more the Union is enlarged. While people vote directly for their MEPs and indirectly for the members of the Council of Ministers, there is no real emotional sense of participation among the general population of the European Union in EU decisions. The people of Ireland and other EU countries do not feel that the decisions of the EU are decisions in which they have had a part. This lack of a sense of participation in EU decisions is a potentially fatal flaw in the whole project. This is not a flaw that can be cured just by giving more powers to national Parliaments.</P>
    <P>Members of national Parliaments are seen as much a part of the insider EU elite, with trips to Europe and so on, as MEPs, Commissioners and Ministers. We must change the Constitution of the European Union to create a direct emotional and legitimate link between each European citizen and the key decision-making institutions of the Union. That can be done if we allow the people of Europe, when they vote at European Parliament elections, to vote, directly or indirectly, for the person who, following the election, will be the incoming President of the European Commission. There is a number of ways in which this can be done. As Taoiseach, I commissioned academic research on this topic, which was published. This is a proposal I will promote at every opportunity because I believe that, until <Col N="1177" /> that happens, until people have an opportunity in each member state to vote for the President of Europe, they will not have a sense that Europe belongs to them, that there is a personal link between them and the European Union, that Europe for them is a person.</P>
    <P>It is a truism of politics that, at the end of the day, people vote for people, not for ideas. As far as the European Union is concerned, we are simply being asked to vote for ideas, not people. We all know that voting for an MEP does not create any real link between what happens in the European Union and our vote because the individual MEP in one's constituency does not have that much of an impact on what happens. If, on the other hand, every European could vote to choose either the leader of the socialist group, the leader of the European People's Party and the leader of the liberal group to be the President of the Commission, while the same debate was taking place in the coffee houses of Greece and the public houses of Donegal about whether Mr. X, Miss Y or Mrs. so and so would be the better President of the European Commission, that discussion of the same choice throughout the whole Union would cement a sense of commonality and citizenship between all the people, no matter where they live in Europe. The essential requirement is that Europeans, whether they live in Palermo or Pettigo, vote on the same day on the same choice, between two or three people who represent alternative visions of Europe.</P>
    <P>Just as the presidential elections have bound all United States citizens together in a joint act every four years of US citizenship, thereby keeping that great union together, I believe that a similar joint act of European Union citizenship is now needed if the Union is to have the emotional cement to hold it together in face of the many stresses and strains it is bound to face in the years ahead.</P>

I want to put on record my appreciation, and that of many Members of this House, of the work and input of the Deputy into European matters in the various offices he held. I pay tribute in particular to his work and negotiations on the Amsterdam treaty.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute positively to the Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001. I understand that the purpose of the Bill is to obtain the approval of the public to make constitutional changes necessary to enable the State to ratify the Nice treaty. This ratification gives us an opportunity to review the wider European issues, develop our approach on European-related matters in the coming years <Col N="1178" /> and recall why the Irish have been so pro-European to date.</P>
      <P>We initially joined the European Community on the basis that we were prepared to incur losses and disadvantages in a number of areas in the knowledge and assurance that benefits from other areas would far outweigh any losses that might occur. Since our membership of the European Union, there has been a steady and consistent accruing of benefits to this country. I congratulate all those involved in the developments to date, not just Deputy Bruton, as Taoiseach, but successive holders of office and Governments which carried out negotiations on European affairs. I include in this some key players in the Civil Service who have been fundamental to developments behind the scenes. I congratulate all involved on the very positive developments in the interests of the public.</P>
      <P>In light of all that has been said, I wish to put on record the Irish treaty of accession which included a special protocol for Ireland. I understand the special protocol referred to the desire to settle certain special problems of concern to Ireland at that time. One of the fundamental objectives of the then European Community and the Economic Council included the steady improvement of the living standards and working conditions of the people of member states, the harmonious development of their economies by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the then less favoured regions, the support of the then Government's policy of industrialisation and economic development designed to align the standards of living in Ireland with those of other European nations and to eliminate unemployment and progressively address regional differences in levels of development. I believe we have achieved most of what we set out to achieve in the special protocol and, indeed, surpassed it.</P>
      <P>If one takes a good look at Ireland's progressive development, its levelling of the huge variances that existed between Ireland and the then leading member states, one could easily put forward a strong argument that we have passed out some of the then leading member states. It is important to pay tribute to everyone involved in our tremendous record since joining the European Community in the early 1970s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is indeed a model for the countries now queuing up to join the European Union. Membership of Europe has been invaluable to Ireland in promoting economic growth, employment, regional development and social inclusion. Some contributors to this debate to date have expressed concerns and outlined their political judgment on what they understand the Treaty of Nice to mean. It has been stated that the Treaty of Nice is fundamentally about giving more power to the bigger EU states, dividing member states into first and second class and not about enlargement, that proposed new majority voting structures will be detrimental to Ireland and it will mean EU militarisation, loss of our neutrality and committing <Col N="1179" /> ourselves to going to war. On that basis, people are being requested to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; to this treaty and that Nice is bad for Ireland and Europe.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with those political judgments. They are not true and are unfounded. If we take time to reflect on the treaties to date since the Treaty of Paris in 1951 and the development of the EU, a fair and balanced judgment call would be that progressive and successful steps have been made to a better, wealthier and healthier Europe &ndash; progressive and successful because, thank God, we have closed the history book in which European countries were at war with one another and where millions of Europeans lost their lives in wars and conflicts. The seeds of lasting peace and stability have been sown along with economic co-operation. This has given us all the opportunity to enjoy unprecedented prosperity and material wealth across western Europe. The Nice Treaty is a further step to pave the way for a bigger, more challenging and better Europe. I envisage nearly the whole continent of Europe and further afield will be the catchment of the enlarged European Union. We owe it to ourselves, to this generation and to future generations to ensure the European Union is strong, vibrant and challenging and can compete equally in the global markets, in particular with the United States and the Asian countries.</P>
    <P>This enlarged European Union should be even more stable and produce even greater opportunities and prosperity. The enlarged market will mean even bigger challenges. The Irish can be rightly proud of the role they have played to date in encouraging and bringing about some of the developments in the European Union. The Nice Treaty is central to the development of Europe. There is a strong need for active participation in all matters European. It is not sufficient to allow indifferent responses to issues so fundamental to our social and economic growth. Changing economic times call for a constant awareness of new markets. As chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business I am acutely aware that Ireland's continued economic growth requires us all to avail and be aware of expanding markets and business opportunities afforded to us in this expanded Europe. The eastern bloc is experiencing a period of unprecedented economic expansion. Ireland has much to contribute to experiences in these countries and much to gain in participation in increasing vibrant markets.</P>
    <P>As a country which benefited hugely from entry into Europe, there is a moral obligation on Ireland to assist other countries now wishing to make the transition from traditional to modern societies. The rising tide will assist all boats if the stronger forces remain aware of their duties to the weaker forces within.</P>
    <P>We are an increasingly multi-cultural, multi-racial society. Our borders are no longer determined only by our nationality. We must embrace expansion as an outward looking nation and we <Col N="1180" /> must do so in the context of a nation which is confident in its own right and rooted deeply enough in its own tradition to be able to embrace others. Our self-belief is the sign of a country that has reached maturity and is, therefore, happy to take its place in the larger body of nations. Those who feel threatened by change should not underestimate the importance of Ireland's confidence in being able to hold its own in a larger Europe.</P>
    <P>There are many issues which cause concern for groups discussing the Nice Treaty. A healthy debate is to be welcomed. Nevertheless, it should be remembered that in the EU decisions are largely by consensus and, therefore, fears of a weakened voice for Ireland are unfounded. Ireland has an international reputation as a peacekeeper of which we are justifiably proud. This would not be consist with membership of any army other than that of a peacekeeping mission. Most important is the need to embrace change. The confidence to benefit from change without feeling threatened is fundamental to a modern, vibrant nation, so too is the largesse to express solidarity with emerging economies and to allow them to benefit from our experience. In an increasing global context, a stronger Europe is vital to all.</P>
    <P>The next decade of development and enlargement will be of vital importance to Ireland and, indeed, its capital city, Dublin. There is an optimism abroad about Dublin. Dublin has been dramatically transformed, its environment has greatly improved and it is nearly unrecognisable compared to the pre-European Union days. The capital city of Dublin, while as cosmopolitan as any other mainland European capital, retains a unique intimacy. Dublin offers and has enjoyed huge investments, partly due to its strategic location in Europe with excellent communications networks, a young, adaptable, highly motivated and well educated population, a full range of national and international business services and a wide range of leisure activities with virtually every sporting interest catered for. It is a city that is alive with music &ndash; an attractive and fulfilling place to live. It is a city of which I am proud to be a native and claim citizenship &ndash; a city I am proud to represent in our national Parliament. Dublin's blend of 18th century elegance and modern facilities combine in a capital city of Europe which offers excellent opportunities allied to a lifestyle all too rare in the world of today.</P>
    <P>The city centre, streets, shops and residential areas have enjoyed investment of hundreds of millions of pounds in the heart of the city. People in their thousands have discovered the advantage of inner city living and a new ambience has been created. Areas of the city have been totally revitalised but only with the support and funding from Europe. The financial services centre and the docklands are being rebuilt on a grand scale. New transport solutions include the port tunnel, extended motorways, additional River Liffey <Col N="1181" /> bridges, quality bus corridors, light rail and other rail systems.</P>
    <P>Dublin also has its painful share of the growing social problems experienced by many large European cities, including drug abuse, crime, discrimination and homelessness. However, there is now a solid foundation from which to begin to solve these and other problems and it is up to all of us to work together and equally learn from the experiences of other European capitals. The next decade will witness the city growing in density rather than in size, similar to other European capitals. The population of the greater Dublin area is likely to be in excess of two million or thereabouts by 2011.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that, at the commencement of the last round of Structural Funds, the four Dublin local authorities agreed that a full-time presence was required in Brussels. The purpose of this officer was to monitor all EU activities and policies and to advise and inform the Dublin local authorities of policy developments and lobby strategies at national and European level. The officer represented the interests of the Dublin local authorities to the Community institutions and to other relevant bodies and sourced and initiated funding projects from the EU.</P>
    <P>A European officer was also appointed within each local authority area at this time to act as a contact for the Brussels officer. This was a great innovative step to ensure we had our finger on the pulse in terms of what was happening in Europe. Some views have been expressed that Europe is so far away that it does not affect us on a daily basis. However, it is recognised in the macro picture that it plays a fundamental role. Equally, it is important to acknowledge the success of one local authority with its finger on the pulse in Europe.</P>
    <P>A number of projects have been undertaken in conjunction with other capital cities in Italy, Greece, Spain, France, Germany and the UK. A telework education system of active distance learning on telework and new work methods was submitted and approved. The first meeting on it took place only last month. The RECITE project involves a number of European focuses and encompasses Finglas south. It is a development project, which will be officially launched on 25 May in the resource centre in Finglas. Finglas is a partner with London, Madrid, Rome and Portugal.</P>
    <P>We can learn from and share in other interesting projects such as the HEATSUN project, which will address issues relating to waste management. There are many projects dealing with issues ranging from economic development, urban regeneration, social inclusion and waste management to Eurocities networking. Such projects have been successful and Dublin has benefited from the input of the EU.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation's project on combined heat and power, CHP, won the Bremen Partner<Col N="1182" /> ship Award in the category &ldquo;Addressing global responsibilities through local action&rdquo;. It is nice that the corporation has received acknowledgement for its work in this area and a handsome cheque for £10,000. I congratulate Dublin Corporation and the other local authorities in the Dublin area on their innovative appointments of officers in local offices and the Paris office and their involvement in a tremendous range of projects. That list of projects is available in a report to the strategic policy committee on economic development, planning and European affairs, which was published by the European officer earlier today.</P>
    <P>I commend the legislation to the House. I hope it will be passed without difficulty and that any of the unfounded arguments made during the debate will be adequately addressed.</P>

I am sure Deputy O'Shea regrets he missed the opportunity to do likewise in regard to Waterford city.</P>

      <P>Cork has done extremely well in European terms. The final phase of the ring road around the city is being completed and a major drainage scheme has been undertaken. The streets are being torn up as a new drainage system is put in place. The construction of a major sewage treatment plant will also commence later this year. The people of Cork, similar to those in Dublin and Dundalk, will no longer discharge raw sewage and effluent into our waterways. I look forward to the day when our waterways are regenerated. All our major cities are located on the coast and citizens in other countries derive great value from waterways whether in terms of public transport or leisure activities. It is important that we respect our waterways and I look forward to the completion of the process.</P>
      <P>The debate relates to the Treaty of Nice and the holding of a referendum on it. However, the legislation is being rushed through the House. The treaty is an important step in the enlargement of the Union but within eight weeks we may be voting on this important referendum. We have not been given enough time to debate the treaty. There is a debate in the House but the public has not been aroused by the Nice Treaty. People are not fully aware about what it involves. Any Member who has been involved in promoting or opposing referenda on European matters will know that such debates take a while to get going but once they take off the public gets involved. Misleading statements that are difficult to challenge are often put out by those opposed to referenda and they give rise to much detailed debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael has always been to the forefront in <Col N="1183" /> promoting Ireland's involvement in the EU and promoting any referendum that has taken place. It is important that time is taken to give ourselves the opportunity to explain to the public exactly what the Nice Treaty is about and what it means for Ireland. I will promote Ireland's membership of the Union in whatever way I can.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been a member of the European Community for almost 30 years and we have played our part. The country has done well as a result of its membership and I hope we will continue to play a strong and meaningful role. The turnout in recent referenda has fallen. The all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution examined this and recommended that there should be a period of 90 days between the passage of a Bill by the Houses of the Oireachtas and the holding of a referendum to ensure the issue can be promoted and considered. It would also ensure that people who are interested or concerned about the issue have an opportunity to address it.</P>
    <P>A complicating factor on this occasion is the foot and mouth disease crisis. Many people in the agricultural community will be reluctant to attend public meetings for obvious reasons, which means the campaign will be further hampered. However, there is no need to hold the referendum before the summer. I do not understand why it cannot be held in the autumn. This would give people more time to address the issues. The treaty does not have to be ratified until the end of 2002 so there is no need to rush it. We should give ourselves more time to engage in debate and inform the public.</P>
    <P>During the last referendum, a booklet was delivered to every household. I hope that will happen on this occasion, although I am aware it is a matter for the Referendum Commission. That booklet which posed questions and provided answers played an important role in the last campaign and I hope there will be a similar booklet for this referendum.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to hold four referenda on 7 June and my view is that the matters should be separated. The Nice Treaty is most important and it will generate heated debate. Everybody will be challenged by it and it is important that we have the space and time to address it. The focus should be solely on the Nice Treaty. In the last referendum campaign, people were told that if they were in any doubt, they should vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;. I do not want that to happen on this occasion, but there will be confusion if four referenda are held on the same day. There is a danger that the important Nice Treaty will be lost and the necessary emphasis will not be placed on it. No hard and fast decisions have been made on the matter and there is still time to reconsider holding all four referenda on the same day.</P>
    <P>If the treaty is rejected by the public &ndash; I hope that will not happen &ndash; enlargement will be stopped. This would send out the wrong message to countries that are aspiring to membership of <Col N="1184" /> the Union. I met representatives from Romania, Poland and Hungary last year and they wanted the process speeded up. They were concerned about that aspect. They did not realise the long process that is involved and the hoops through which they are expected to jump before they are in a position to join the EU. It is most important that Ireland does not send out the wrong message. It must be seen to play its role and deliver a strong, clear message that it supports Europe and will continue to play its part with pride in an enlarged EU. This is a challenge for us all, but we should not create any obstacles to enlargement. However, the insufficient time being provided for the debate and the holding of four referenda on the same day are obstacles and I hope we do not live to regret it.</P>
    <P>The treaty is necessary to enable the structures of the EU to be changed and allow enlargement. The countries seeking accession include Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. It is important to remember Ireland's stage of development when it joined the Union in 1972 and its position today. Nobody could doubt that we have come a long way in the past 30 years and done very well from Europe. It will not be as easy for Ireland in the future, but the country is one of the leading lights in Europe. We have contributed to the Union, but we have also done very well from our membership. Ireland is second to none in Europe in terms of economic development, employment rates and regional development. It is important to bear in mind the contrast between Ireland in 1972 and the country now.</P>
    <P>Many of the countries seeking accession are poorer than Ireland was at that time while some of them are at the same point. They also have an important contribution to make to the Union and they should be embraced. An enlarged Union would be a ready market for Irish exports and an important pool of employment. It would also be a further stage in Ireland's development in Europe. Poland has two million farmers and they see how well Ireland's agricultural economy has fared within Europe. If Poland joins the EU, it will mean an even greater number of farmers in Europe and CAP reform will have to be considered. The German Agriculture Minister has already proposed agricultural reform. There are many changes ahead, not only in relation to agriculture, and it is important that Ireland is at the table and has something to contribute.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that Ireland is likely to lose its Commissioner or not have representation for a period. The Taoiseach said he highlighted the matter and stated it was important the Ireland retains its Commissioner. However, that will not happen under the treaty and Ireland will be without a Commissioner at some stage. Deputy Bruton made the important point that Germany will also be without a Commissioner at some stage and that its large population will not be represented. When that hits home, people will cry <Col N="1185" /> foul. There must be some way of accommodating a representative from all countries. It is not an impossible situation. As Deputy Bruton said, there are 40 Ministers in the United Kingdom and they can be accommodated. I hope this issue can be revisited and re-examined because it is important we do not lose a Commissioner. It is a powerful position and has been valuable to Ireland. We have been represented at that level even though we are a small nation.</P>
    <P>The changes in structures mean our representation will be reduced from 15 to 12 MEPs in the next election in 2004. I can see the reason for that. Voting rights must be diluted as the Union expands. However, it is something Members on all sides of the House must defend. The debate on the treaty will be very difficult and I will do what I can to promote the treaty. However, the Dáil is in recess for the next fortnight. What will any of us do in that time to promote the treaty? The timeframe will be short and the public has not yet recognised and taken charge of the debate. Given the historical nature of referenda on European treaties where turnout and the vote in favour of the treaties has declined steadily, I hope the fact that the treaty will be put to the people on the same day as other referenda will not be detrimental to it. I am sure it will be passed and I hope we all play our part in promoting it and doing what we can to ensure Ireland votes yes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé lán sásta deis a bheith agam chun cuidiú leis an díospóireacht an-tábhachtach seo faoi Chonradh Nice. I am glad to have this opportunity to address the House on the implications of the Treaty of Nice for Ireland. The treaty was agreed by member states in December last. It is fundamentally about preparing the European Union for a significant expansion in its membership. Twelve countries are in active negotiations to join the European Union, and the first accessions are likely to occur within three to four years.</P>
      <P>All member states recognise the historic importance of enlargement for the candidate countries and for Europe as a whole. Those countries which struggled to replace dictatorships with democratic rule will be offered the opportunity to develop economically while completing their equally important political transformation. Democracy and stability will be greatly strengthened throughout Europe and, for the first time, Europe will be united on the basis of democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, the Single Market, which is a huge success of the European Union, will be extended to embrace up to 500 million people. Ireland especially has benefited from the Single Market due to the key importance of exports for our continuing economic growth. Trade with the applicant states is growing quickly while Irish <Col N="1186" /> companies are major investors in countries such as Poland and others.</P>
    <P>Participation in the Single Market has been a key part of Ireland's economic success. On the one hand, it has added to the attraction of Ireland as a destination for investment and, on the other, it has also assisted our indigenous companies to develop. Not only have they gained access to a large market, they have also gained opportunities for co-operation with partner companies throughout Europe and beyond.</P>
    <P>We are the largest exporter of software in the world and more than two-thirds of the computers sold in Europe are made in Ireland. Trade now accounts for more than 160% of GDP. This means that we are the second most open economy in the world with a dependence on international trade and a unique capacity to trade internationally.</P>
    <P>Economic development support from the EU helped us transform our economy. This support, although significant, represented at its height only a tiny proportion of Ireland's GNP and is now declining in line with our stronger economic performance. Its importance lay not in its size but in the careful use to which it was put, namely, investment in economic infrastructure and in education and training. As a result, it helped contribute to the increase in our income per head from 64% of the EU average in the 1970s to above the EU average today. The launch of the euro in January next as a working tangible currency will add further to this advantage for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The removal of some of the last barriers to trade and partnerships, namely, currency costs and risks, and the improvements in market transparency which the euro will involve present us with new opportunities and new risks. Opportunities will arise in the greater ease of access to markets and improved possibilities for competitive sourcing of inputs. The risks are that all other countries in Europe are thinking the same way. However, I am confident that, over the past decade, we have taken appropriate steps to improve our competitiveness which will permit us to continue to compete effectively with other EU member states.</P>
    <P>In essence, enlargement is right for Europe and for Ireland. Naturally the European Union has recognised that, to continue to operate effectively with many new member states, some changes will be necessary to its institutions and decision making procedures. As I mentioned, the Treaty of Nice agrees these necessary changes to the Commission, to voting weights in the Council and to the European Parliament and other bodies, and extends the range of issues subject to qualified majority voting or QMV. It is certainly in Ireland's interest that the European Union functions effectively after enlargement. All the European Union member states are committed to ratifying the Nice Treaty by the end of 2002 to allow the enlargement timetable to proceed on schedule. Ireland is alone among the member states in <Col N="1187" /> putting approval of the treaty to the people in a referendum.</P>
    <P>Four times in recent decades the people have demonstrated their support for Ireland's positive participation in Europe, and the Government and, I am sure, the House are fully confident the public's support will continue in the forthcoming referendum. Ratification of the treaty is clearly in Ireland's interests. To do otherwise would be to turn our back on a key element of our economic development, to say that political and democratic stability throughout Europe is not in our interest and to ignore the economic benefits and opportunities offered to Ireland by enlargement.</P>
    <P>Many people may only have a hazy idea of what the Treaty of Nice entails involving, as it does, a series of articles and protocols which often deal with seemingly obscure areas. This is the reason the Government has published a factual, objective and informative White Paper on the treaty which my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, launched recently. The White Paper explains in detail and in accessible form the changes the Treaty of Nice will make and their impact on Ireland. The White Paper has also been prepared in summary form and, in the interests of ensuring the widest possible public awareness, a copy will be distributed to every household in the country. In addition, the White Paper summaries, in both Irish and English, and the text of the Nice Treaty are all available on the Department of Foreign Affairs website.</P>
    <P>We are now faced with an historic opportunity to embrace the future development of Europe. In each specific area where the Treaty of Nice makes changes, the essential Interests of Ireland as a smaller state have been protected. We will continue to nominate a Commissioner until the European Union reaches 27 member states, with the large states giving up their second Commissioner from 2005. Once there are 27 members, there will be a rotation system for the Commission, with each state treated on an equal basis irrespective of size, population or location. Our voting weight in an enlarged European Union will be the same as Finland and Denmark, which is still more than double the relative weight of our population. In terms of seats in the European Parliament, our total will eventually be 12 in a European Union of 27 states, which again is one of the highest population-to-seats ratio of any country in the European Union.</P>
    <P>Qualified majority voting, already used for the majority of Council decisions, is being extended to new areas to facilitate decision making in a larger European Union. This means that any single member state cannot block measures in these areas, something we support. However I am sure Members are aware that one area which will not move to QMV is taxation, where the Taoiseach, on behalf of Ireland, insisted at Nice on the retention of unanimity. We believe taxation is a fundamental tool of national policy making and must <Col N="1188" /> remain subject to domestic control within each country.</P>
    <P>I also reject the notion that the treaty will lead to a two-tier Europe. The arrangements for smaller groups to proceed in certain areas, the so-called &ldquo;enhanced co-operation&rdquo;, include many safeguards designed to ensure that this will not happen. The arrangements work well for the euro group, and there is no reason in the right circumstances they could not work satisfactorily in other areas.</P>
    <P>The changes made by Nice will permit the enlargement of the European Union to proceed on schedule. This will be good for Europe and very good for Ireland. As elected democrats to this House, we should ensure democracy continues to be sustained in a much larger Europe in the exciting years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as allegations of Sinn Féin activities in north Kerry are concerned, as I mentioned in the House on Tuesday night in the course of a debate on a Private Members' motion, I have received a report from the Garda about the alleged activities. A Garda investigation is continuing into the matter. Similarly, in so far as the incident in Wexford is concerned, I am advised by the Garda that <Col N="1189" /> investigations are also continuing. These are very serious allegations and it would be completely intolerable for any person or persons to seek to usurp the functions of the Garda Síochána in the investigation of crime. As Garda investigations into these matters are continuing, the House will appreciate that it would not be right for me to comment in detail on what is alleged to have happened. It is very important that nothing is said in the House which might prejudice or adversely affect the investigations.</P>
    <P>The Government's position on vigilantism is clear and simple. There is no place in our society for vigilantism, no matter how it is dressed up, and it cannot and will not be accepted. The Garda Síochána has a statutory duty to investigate crime and individuals or groups who seek to usurp the functions of the Garda or engage in intimidation, assaults or threats will face the full rigour of the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dismayed that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not yet received a report from the Garda on this serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>He has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that his concept of zero tolerance is now a laughing stock when on his home patch in County Kerry, in his constituency, serious allegations of the type referred to have been made? Can he confirm that Sinn Féin, a political party registered in the State, is involved in street patrols and acts of intimidation throughout County Kerry and operating a private security firm which usurps the role and functions of the Garda? I put it to him that this matter is far more urgent and serious than his reply suggests and that it is incumbent on him, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to ensure that the only security force operating for and on behalf of citizens is the Garda. What does he intend to do about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had been listening, he would have heard me say that I had received a Garda report on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>In his anxiety, however, to launch a tirade of allegations, which are not fully correct, he decided to ignore the first part of my reply. Regarding zero tolerance, I have explained on numerous occasions that crime levels have fallen by 25% since 1995, when the Deputy's party was in office, when there were 102,000 indictable crimes, an all time high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, please, deal with the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us leave that matter aside for the moment. It is completely inaccurate to say that there are gangs marauding around <Col N="1190" /> County Kerry intimidating people. There have been complaints in specific areas in the north of the county where allegations of vigilantism have been presented. I have explained on more than one occasion that vigilantism will not be tolerated and that anarchy will ensue if people take the law into their own hands and become judge, jury and executioner. I have also explained that the matters in question are being investigated by the Garda. I am not, unfortunately, at liberty to outline to the House what precisely is contained in its report. I can only say that I expect the investigations to be completed and that I hope these matters will be dealt with by the Garda in accordance with due process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the issue of vigilantism in counties Kerry and Wexford and the constituency of Dublin West is among the most serious confronting the proper operation of democratic policing in the State and will he undertake to publish the report he has received regarding activities in County Kerry? Was the shooting in Wexford of an innocent man by gunmen wearing balaclavas drugs related and was there paramilitary involvement? Does the Minister agree with the statement of his colleague and former ministerial office holder, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, that Sinn Féin needs to be confronted about these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Garda investigations into the matters in question are under way and there is every possibility that there will be prosecutions with convictions ensuing. Vigilantism is, most certainly, bad for democracy. There are allegations to the effect that in certain places in electioneering certain members of Sinn Féin are disregarding the rule of law. These allegations are being investigated. I wholeheartedly agree with the Deputy that if any group assumes the right to become judge, jury and executioner, it undermines the concept of democracy. I have repeated that this will not be tolerated and is unacceptable in any civilised society. If other political parties were to engage in similar activities, can one imagine the chaos that would ensue overnight? While I agree fully with the Deputies, I cannot give an undertaking to publish the report at this time because investigations are ongoing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a sufficiency of detail to enable me to reply to Deputy Howlin on the incident in Wexford, but agree with the general point made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis that the Minister will not publish the information which has been made available to him, will he confirm that there is in operation in County Kerry &ndash; perhaps in other places also &ndash; private, subversive, security <Col N="1191" /> firms, in particular a group known as Kerry Concerned Parents Against Drugs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that a certain person, who states that he is a member of Sinn Féin, has stated publicly that he was involved in recovering what he described as stolen property and returning it to its original owner. I have also published a new security Bill which is designed to ensure that in future there will be a licensing system for companies and individuals who wish to become involved in the security trade. The objective of the exercise is to ensure that those who become involved in the security industry are of good character and are sufficiently professional in the exercise of their duties.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general question of who is, or is not, involved in these matters, Deputy Flanagan would appreciate more than most that it is neither feasible nor possible for me to publish the report he mentioned without prejudicing a possible prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a direct question because the usefulness of parliamentary questions is itself undermined by the Minister's approach to this? I tabled a parliamentary question asking for the current status of an investigation in relation to a shooting in Wexford but the Minister says that he does not have any information to give me. That is not acceptable. Will the Minister answer the broad questions that certainly prejudice no prosecution in relation to the Wexford shooting. First, can he rule out, or rule in, paramilitary involvement? Second, as far as the Garda Síochána has ascertained to date, is this a drugs related shooting? The answers to those simple questions should be available to the Minister. As the Minister charged with protecting the rule of law, will he outline what specific strategy he has to combat vigilantism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Much as I might be tempted to reply directly to Deputy Howlin's questions, I would be rightly censured in this House and elsewhere were I to engage upon specifics which might ultimately prejudice a prosecution. Deputy Howlin will appreciate that.</P>

In regard to other matters, I cannot be expected to come to the House and reply to questions about matters which are under investigation by An Garda Síochána.

      <P>I can confirm that I have recently received correspondence in relation to this issue from the person referred to. The position is that a cranial osteopathy practitioner who has done work in the past with the prison service in England, has also practised this treatment until recently on a voluntary basis with the Dóchas centre in Mountjoy women's prison. She has now proposed a programme for this activity in Irish prisons to be funded entirely by my Department to the tune of £250,000 per annum. While the proposal remains under consideration, preliminary information suggests that the prison authorities do not regard it as cost effective. In addition, initial observations from the governor of Mountjoy Prison indicate that there is no tangible evidence to suggest that the programme was <Col N="1193" /> changing the behaviour of the more difficult women.</P>
      <P>The programme is based on cranial structure treatment &ndash; that is, head massages &ndash; which can be integrated with acupuncture, homeopathy, aromatherapy, reflexology, yoga, counselling and other treatments. I have to say that I have not had any of these treatments myself&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;although it does occur to me that a number of people here would do well to engage in the exercise. It claims to give healing energy to patients involved in this type of treatment. Prisoners' health care arrangements generally match public health care provision in the wider community. Cranial osteopathy would be regarded as a complementary health care activity and, as a general rule, this would be outside the range of public health care provision in this country as is made available from public funds. I have no plans to introduce elements of complementary medicine in the prisons here which are not available in public health care provision in the wider community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Will he elaborate on his suggestion that this scheme is not cost effective? In the context of habitual offending, we have learned over the years that the revolving door syndrome exists in our prisons. The same people who have served their sentences, or a portion thereof, return to prison through a cyclical system in Mountjoy and other prisons throughout the State. It might be worthwhile to examine the best preventative and therapeutic treatment that is available. Has the Minister considered the success of the integrated complementary therapeutic programme in the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom? Will he ensure that every opportunity is taken by his officials on the prison services board to explore new methods within the prison system if they can succeed in breaking the cycle of habitual offending?</P>

      <P>Last year, following a previous bid for funding for this form of treatment, which was supported by various claims regarding the involvement of this organisation in various English prisons, the director of prison medical services made inquiries with the English prison health policy unit regarding this matter. Contrary to their claims, it appears that the complementary medical services in prisons organisation does not currently, and has not had for some time, any involvement on a funded basis there. It appears that they were invited to make a supply proposal on a competitive basis but this was not forthcoming. The Prisons Service management there indicated that the CMSP was unwilling to accept <Col N="1194" /> an independent, audited and objective review based approach.</P>
      <P>I am not aware, although Deputy Flanagan might be, of any objective scientific based evidence to support the claim that this form of medical approach has proven to be effective. Furthermore, the support of testimonies included in the correspondence does not appear to have what I would describe as objective validation.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the director of prison medical services that the alternative therapeutic approach promoted has no statutory or other accreditation in this country. He would, on behalf of registered practitioners, have to seek guidance from the Medical Council with regard to the ethical approach for any co-operation with such an organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I announced last November that a total of £12 million was to be allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years as part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme, with £4 million being allocated in 2001. As part of the first tranche, Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in the following areas &ndash; Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that tenders will soon issue, in line with EU and public procurement guidelines, for the provision of town centre CCTV systems in Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. Tenders received must then be evaluated before any contracts can be placed. While this process will inevitably take time, it is expected that the CCTV system in Bray will be operational during the final quarter of 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that a local town centre CCTV implementation committee will be established by the local chief superintendent in each area where a Garda CCTV system is to be installed. The local chief superintendent will have responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the CCTV sys<Col N="1195" /> tem in his or her particular area. The composition of this committee will include representatives of the following: the Garda telecommunications section which will project manage the technical aspects of the system, local crime prevention officers, the ESB, the local authority, the Office of Public Works and local business interests.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that a total of 27 cars had their tyres slashed during the night of 6/7 April 2001. The incidents occurred in a number of locations and were not targeted to a particular area. The matter is currently under investigation by the detective unit at Bray and, to date, there are no suspects or motives.</P>

      <P>This question was tabled by my colleague, Deputy Timmins. I wish to join with previous speakers in conveying my sympathy to him and his family on the untimely and sad death of his late father, Godfrey Timmins.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to put a timeframe on when the closed circuit TV system will be in operation in Bray? Does he accept the fact that Bray has a serious vandalism problem which can be countered by the provision of a closed circuit TV system as proposed by Deputy Timmins? Could he inform the House that every effort will be made to expedite the tendering process so as to ensure that these cameras will be in operation?</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will allow me to refer briefly to a wider issue. What criteria does his Department apply in determining the choice of towns? My own town of Portlaoise, which has a prison population of some significance and a significant crime problem, has applied to the Department for CCTV but the application seems to be in some sort of limbo. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the last question first, there is a Garda committee dealing with the question of prioritising towns for CCTV and that advice is taken on board in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The situation in Bray is that it has been prioritised and I anticipate that we should be in a position to install the system at a relatively early date. A detailed request for tender has been prepared by the Garda telecommunications section and tenders will soon issue. They must then be evaluated before any contracts can be placed and inevitably that will take some time. There is then the question of obtaining way-leaves in respect of buildings where cameras and associated equipment are to be located, and the obtaining of the necessary planning permission must also be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the crime problem in Bray to which Deputy Flanagan referred, he will be aware that recorded crime levels have fallen for each year this Government has held office and that last <Col N="1196" /> year, levels of recorded crime fell by almost 5% on the 1999 figure&mdash;</P>

      <P>The situation in regard to Portlaoise is that where an area is not prioritised, I can understand the wish of some people or organisations in a community who may wish to have CCTV installed anyway. I am introducing a scheme whereby grants will be awarded to such organisations where local participation and community involvement are forthcoming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I must state that I am somewhat limited in what I can say in this case as the matter is due before Cork Circuit Court on 1 May 2001. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that a single vehicle accident occurred at Lehenaghmore, Togher, Cork, at approximately 6.25 p.m. on 3 May 1999 and <Col N="1197" /> that there were seven occupants in the vehicle and one of the passengers was fatally injured. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that a full investigation was conducted into the circumstances of the accident and that this involved, among other things, a detailed examination of the vehicle which had been extensively damaged.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the car was preserved in the car compound at Togher Garda station until 28 June 1999, when it was removed to a scrap yard. I understand that on 29 June 1999, the driver of the car delivered a prepared statement to Togher Garda station setting out his version of the circumstances of the accident and that the Garda file on the matter was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for direction on 21 July 1999.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that the DPP's directions were received on 1 December 1999 and were that the driver be prosecuted for dangerous driving causing death. These proceedings commenced on 22 December 1999 when the accused was arrested and brought before Cork District Court. The accused was subsequently sent forward for trial to Cork Circuit Court and the case stands adjourned to 1 May 2001.</P>
      <P>On 23 February 2000, however, a solicitor acting for the defendant wrote to the acting State Solicitor requesting permission to have the vehicle examined. Inquiries were immediately undertaken by the gardaí to locate the vehicle and it was subsequently located in the scrap yard but the engine had been removed and some damage had been caused during storage. I am informed that the vehicle, minus the engine, was returned to Togher Garda station on 2 June 2000, the defendant's solicitor was informed and an assessor, on behalf of the defendant, subsequently examined the vehicle.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the defendant commenced judicial review proceedings before the High Court seeking a permanent injunction preventing his trial on the charge of dangerous driving causing death proceeding. In an <i>ex-tempore</i> judgment delivered on the 29 March 2001, the High Court granted the relief sought. This was without prejudice to the defendant being prosecuted on any other charges that may have arisen. The question of any appeal in relation to that decision is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions who is independent in the performance of his functions.</P>
      <P>In relation to the circumstances surrounding the disposal of the vehicle, I am informed by the Garda authorities that an investigation has commenced in relation to this matter and whether it amounts to a breach of the Garda Síochána (Disciplinary Regulations).</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that procedures in relation to the retention or disposal of vehicles involved in accidents will be examined taking into account the implications of the High Court judgment and any new procedures will be introduced where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> It is a matter of concern that the family of the victim first learned of the outcome of the High Court case from media reports. I am informed by the Garda authorities in this regard that the family were in regular touch with the gardaí at Togher and that when the case went before the High Court, the process and the problems arising were explained to the family. However, as the case was dealt with by way of affidavits, the gardaí were not notified of the date when the case was due be heard before the High Court.</P>
    <P>While all of us must be careful not to say anything which could prejudice any future proceedings that might arise in this case, I accept fully that should it not be possible to pursue a serious case because of some procedural or other fault that would be a mater of deep concern. In the circumstances I have asked the Garda Commissioner to keep me fully informed of developments in relation to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. As far as I am aware from my discussions with the family, the first they knew of the case was when they were informed by a neighbour who had read it in a newspaper. The Minister said that an investigation was under way. Can he indicate when we will have a report on that investigation? Is it normal practice that the family would not be shown the courtesy of being kept informed about the case? If they had been informed of developments they could have presented themselves in court on the day. It must be remembered that an 18 year old lost his life in this accident. It is not just a case of a car accident. A life has been lost so I ask the Minister to give me some idea of the investigation and when he expects to have it completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that it is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal. Obviously I have no control, for very desirable reasons, over what the Director of Public Prosecutions may do in instances such as this one and in those circumstances, unfortunately, I cannot advise the Deputy of where precisely the investigation stands. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to keep me informed of progress in this particular matter.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of great regret that the family concerned were not informed of the fact that the case was being heard before the High Court on 29 March 2001. The reason for that is that the gardaí themselves were not notified and apparently the case of judicial review was dealt with by way of affidavits from the gardaí. That would be normal in such circumstances. Apparently the gardaí were not made aware of this nor were they made aware of the proceedings, and they only learned of the decision when the family contacted the gardaí at Togher station on 30 March 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked that the question of whether there could be improved communications procedures to try to avoid this situation be examined. I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to the family <Col N="1199" /> of the deceased in this very serious matter. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to keep me fully informed and I fully accept that what occurred in this instance was, to say the least, most regrettable.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned that lawlessness from a small number of youths can curtail much needed bus services to the Tallaght area. As the House will be aware, I have placed a high priority on promoting measures to deal with youth crime and have increased the number of Garda youth diversion projects from 12 when I took office in 1997 to the present day when there are 51 in operation throughout the country. I can inform the House that there are two such projects operating in the west Tallaght area. Furthermore, the Children Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Oireachtas, will have a significant effect on public order offences caused by young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the issues mentioned by the Deputies, I am informed by the Garda authorities that following a conference at Tallaght Garda station on 5 April 2001, an operation named Operation Saferoute was set up to monitor and give specific attention to buses in the Tallaght <Col N="1200" /> area. The operation has a particular emphasis on west Tallaght and, in particular, the 77, 56A and 76 bus routes. I understand that the operation will be in place daily from 6 p.m. to 12 midnight.</P>
    <P>I am further informed that following a meeting on Friday, 6 April 2001, with representatives from SIPTU, the NBRU, Dublin Bus and Garda management, all buses serving the west Tallaght area resumed service on 6 April 2001. Increased Garda patrols are operating in this area as part of Operation Saferoute.</P>
    <P>Garda management have maintained an open line of communication with Dublin Bus and the drivers. I understand that a review of increased security measures will take place on Friday next, 13 April, and that the drivers will subsequently be balloted on the proposals. In the circumstances, I trust Deputies will appreciate that the situation has improved.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the fact that an entire part of the public transport system which services 10,000 homes in my constituency was lost for over one week is further evidence that his policies in this area are not working? Surely the fact that the actions of a small group of youths could bring this about is further evidence that his policies on zero tolerance are failing. Does the Minister accept that? Does he not also accept that my community is discriminated against in terms of the number of Garda personnel stationed there? Limerick, which has a population similar to that of Tallaght, has 293 Garda while my community has 159. Will the Minister immediately reverse his policy of deliberately discriminating against urban communities in Dublin where there is a need for increased numbers of gardaí on the streets?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is his responsibility to ensure passenger safety on Dublin Bus vehicles or is that a matter of internal security for the company? Clarification is needed in that regard.</P>

In all, in excess of 1,300 gardaí have been sent to the Border or to other areas throughout the country to carry out duties directly related to the crisis. I am sure Members will appreciate the necessity for this.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of deep regret that a number of young thugs should behave as they did in this instance. However, the Deputy will accept that the authorities acted speedily with a view to rectifying the situation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>The initial contract price for the construction of the Midlands Prison was £36.9 million, including a retention of £600,000. This contract, which was signed on 20 May 1998, was for the provision of a 400 place secure prison with all necessary services and facilities on a site owned by my Department adjacent to Portlaoise Prison. Subsequent to the commencement of construction in June 1999, a further contract was entered into with the approval of the Government for an additional wing with accommodation for 115 prisoners. The cost of this contract was £6.9 million, including a retention of £120,000.</P>
      <P>Both contracts were awarded on a part design, build and finance basis under which the contractor undertook to develop the design and deliver the buildings in accordance with a brief furnished by the Office of Public Works which managed the project on behalf of my Department and the Prison Service. While the above contracts included a certain level of fit-out, it will be appreciated that on a project of this size and complexity it was decided from the outset not to include all necessary works or fittings in the main contracts. In organising the project in this fashion, my officials were following the practice which had applied in most other prison building works in the modern era. Additional sums totalling approximately £1.6 million have, accordingly, been expended to date on a range of essential items for the prison, including, in particular, security features, locking systems, miscellaneous minor building works, fitting out of workshops and classrooms, etc.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Additional Information</i>The Midlands Prison was opened by me on 9 November 2000 and there are now 194 prisoners in custody there. The numbers in custody are being increased daily in line with staffing resources and other resource and operational requirements. I expect the numbers in custody there to increase to 300 by mid-May.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity to state that this project represents superb value for money. The Midlands Prison will, ultimately, accommodate 515 prisoners in the most modern prison facilities in western Europe. The average capital cost per prisoner, at less than £90,000, is well below the international norm for such facilities. The prison is equipped with the most modern technology available which is utilised particularly to contain staff costs, including those arising from overtime working. This will generate significant future savings in the longer term for the Prison Service and the State.</P>

It appears, however, that the lessons of Clover Hill have not been learned and that heed has not been paid to the Clover Hill debacle as far as appliances, such as keys and locks, are concerned. Does the Minister agree that there is a need to provide a self-contained medical unit with appropriate and proper facilities in the new Midlands Prison to obviate the need for and to cease the practice of the accident and emergency department at Portlaoise General Hospital being prioritised for prisoners to the disadvantage of the public?

If there is more information available, I will communicate it to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the first light of magnanimity from Deputy Flanagan who welcomed the Midlands Prison in Portlaoise.

Specific investigations are taking place concerning events surrounding the foot and mouth outbreak at Proleek Lower, Dundalk and suspected illegal importation of sheep at the relevant time. Any case involving suspected criminality is the subject of full and detailed investigation.</P>
      <P>These investigations are on a countrywide basis and being co-ordinated by the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation. Incident rooms have been established around the country and a Garda liaison office operating from the Ballymascanlon Hotel in Dundalk is in full-time contact with personnel from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and other relevant organisations. The incident rooms are in the towns of Ardee, Roscommon, Carlow and Abbeyleix. In addition, Garda inquiries are also ongoing in relation to movements from the United Kingdom.</P>

    <P>The Garda authorities are utilising all relevant legislation, the European Convention (Trade and Animals and Animal Product) Regulations, 1994, and the recently enacted Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act, 2001, during a vigorous inquiry. Arrests have been made, where appropriate, and searches have been carried out resulting in the seizure of documentation and other items for examination. Garda investigations are ongoing and the Garda anticipates sending a <Col N="1208" /> number of files to the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to instituting proceedings. In the circumstances, the House will appreciate it would be inappropriate to go into further detail about individual investigations.</P>

Can he give us a timeframe in relation to the completion of the investigations? Has he ascertained, to date, if there is any paramilitary involvement, as alleged, in the smuggling of animals across the Border? Is the involvement of meat plants encompassed in the ongoing inquiries on foot of the evidence given by Mr. James Kavanagh in a court case in Carlow last week about the Kildare chilling plant where he collected sheep? </P>

I understand it is envisaged that a number of cases will be forwarded for direction to the Director of Public Prosecutions who will decide what should be done. I do not propose to compromise the efforts of the Garda by making any comment on how that might or might not proceed. There is not any evidence that animals were brought into the jurisdiction illegally since controls were put in place on the Border on 21 February.

      <P>There was legal movement of sheep from the North into the South prior to the restrictions being put in place on 21 February. The movement of sheep after that, in breach of the restrictions, constitutes the offence. From investigations that have taken place, it is clear that sheep were illegally imported. They were taken from the United Kingdom to Northern Ireland on the pretext that they were to be slaughtered in Northern Ireland and they were subsequently moved across the Border into this jurisdiction. I can only answer for the Garda Síochána and any complaints that came to their attention have been fully investigated. This is a matter which continues to receive Garda atten<Col N="1209" /> tion and I expect the Director of Public Prosecutions to take decisions shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>Mountjoy Prison, like almost all of our older prison stock, is long overdue major refurbishment. Many parts of the prison are largely unchanged since the 1850s. The absence of in-cell sanitation throughout large sections of the prison is a particular concern in this regard. I have been in a position to ensure the commencement of refurbishment programmes in some of our other older prisons such as Limerick and Cork. However, Mountjoy due to its location and the fact that the site accommodates four separate institutions is unique. Any major development there must be properly planned on an integrated basis with the overall needs of the Prison Service and the Criminal Justice system in mind. It is also a fact that much of the development of the site over the last 20 to 30 years or so has been carried out on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, often in response to short-term requirements and difficulties such as vast overcrowding due to lack of investment in prison spaces by successive Governments.</P>
      <P>In late 1999 therefore, I approved the establishment of the Mountjoy complex redevelopment group as a consultative body to plan the development of the complex and custodial regimes in the redeveloped prison. The group consists of a multi-disciplinary team of officials from areas that deal with the complex and its prisoners. The terms of reference of the group included a commitment to develop a complete description of the treatment and custodial regimes that will be required for the target population to be detained in Mountjoy Prison, identify the strengths, assets and potential of Mountjoy Prison and the Mountjoy Prison complex within the whole prison and probation system and also the wider community and outline a plan for achieving an optimum regime and prepare an outline description with drawings of a building that would meet the requirements which have been identified</P>
      <P>I have since received two reports from the group both of which I have published. The group's second report was published, with my approval, last month. It contains a number of specific proposals and recommendations for the future development and use of the Mountjoy complex which currently comprises Mountjoy Prison, the training unit, St. Patrick's institution and the female prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed new development will accommodate up to 723 prisoners &ndash; excluding the female prison &ndash; committed from the courts in the Leinster area in house units rather than in the traditional cell blocks. The complex will contain separ<Col N="1210" /> ate induction and pre-release facilities as well as adjoining &ldquo;halfway house&rdquo; accommodation for pre-release and newly released offenders. Overall, the complex will assume a pivotal role in drug treatment service provision in the prison system. A full range of services including chaplaincy, welfare, education and vocational training for prisoners will also be provided on an integrated basis within the complex.</P>
    <P>Architecturally what is proposed is not dissimilar to the new female prison, which was opened in 1999. Overall, the design of the buildings will maximise the potential afforded by open space and light with an emphasis on reducing the institutional effect while still maintaining security. T he most historic architectural features at the prison, including the central block and the landmark twin granite chimney towers, would be retained under this plan.</P>
    <P>Since publication of the latest group report, I have asked the Prison Service to expand their review and planning activity to address the major overflow problem emerging at the Dóchas Centre, Mountjoy. Committals of women to prison from the courts have exceeded all expectation over the past few months. We have found that despite doubling the number of spaces for women prisoners, committals on remand especially have surged beyond any past experience. Whatever the cause, and many factors are at play here, we must and will make adequate provision for this group in the shorter term.</P>
    <P>An estimate of the capital cost of construction and of the operation of the proposed development is being prepared at present and when this is available and having considered various views expressed on the proposal, I intend to bring the matter to Government for approval to proceed with the first phase of the development.</P>
    <P>I wish also to take this opportunity to confirm my intention to engage in consultations with all interested parties including the staff and residents in the area who may be affected by the development over the coming years.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give his views on the report of the Prison Officers' Association on the new women's prison. This states that the new prison is plagued by overcrowding and a serious drug problem. Staff shortages are allowing a drug culture to continue unchecked and the continued use of this centre as a female remand centre is causing what they describe as a disastrous consequential effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the most modern female prison in the western world, the Dóchas Centre attracts hundreds of visitors annually. Prison experts and criminologists regard it as a model of its kind and it is the focus of a number of PhD studies by graduate students. The feedback from these researchers has been overwhelmingly positive. The development represents a quantum leap in terms of working conditions for staff and living conditions for prisoners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is recognised that there is still a drug problem there, as the Deputy mentioned, every effort has been made to tackle the issue of drug abuse among the prison population. The majority of female prisoners are there as a result of their extreme drug dependency. Unfortunately many will continue with this abuse while in custody. However, I am committed to tackling the drug problem in the prison system. The action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system, which I approved in 1999, provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug abusers.</P>

Will female remand prisoners continue to be housed in Dóchas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to try to find additional accommodation for prisoners who at present are in the Dóchas Centre and are the cause of overcrowding. Of late, there has been an increase in the numbers of women on remand. This is regrettable. I intend to provide alternative accommodation and I expect to have that in place soon. While the new prison is a model of its kind, unfortunately it is not large enough to contain the numbers of prisoners requiring accommodation. I increased the number of places during the planning stage, but this has not proven to be sufficient. Once we can relocate female juvenile prisoners and when we have new temporary accommodation for female prisoners, it will alleviate the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has already indicated its intention to bring four issues before the electorate for possible constitutional amendment during the summer. The issues are the Treaty of Nice, the International Criminal Court, judicial oversight and/or impeachment and the removal of references to the death penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment to the Constitution in the area of non-discrimination will be considered at a later stage. The Deputy will know that the Constitutional Review Group recommended amendment of Article 40.1 of the Constitution to pro<Col N="1212" /> vide for equality and non-discrimination. The group recommended the following wording in regard to discrimination:</P>
    <P>No person shall be unfairly discriminated against, directly or indirectly, on any ground such as sex, race, age, disability, sexual orientation, colour, language, culture, religion, political or other opinion, national, social or ethnic origin, membership of the travelling community, property, birth or status.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Constitutional Review Group are being dealt with by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. It is understood that, on completion of its work in regard to the recommendations relating to the institutions of State, the committee proposes to deal with the area of fundamental rights and will consider the equality amendment in the context of this tranche of proposals.</P>
    <P>The information sought was given before to the Deputy as recently as 28 March 2001. The information was given in the context of another parliamentary question asked by the Deputy on that date, by way of clarification, arising from a supplementary question to the Taoiseach made by the Deputy during Taoiseach's Question Time on 7 March 2001.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. I am pursuing this question because I am finding it difficult to secure clarity as to when we can expect the two referenda affecting people with disabilities on social and economic rights and anti-discrimination to be held. What method is being used by the Government in terms of prioritising the issues which will be put to the people in referenda? Can the Minister of State give me any idea of the timescale within which we can expect the referenda to be held? In the context of the proposed disabilities Bill, has the Government obtained legal advice and engaged in legal consultation to ascertain whether the outstanding matters with regard to the Constitution which the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended be dealt with are an obstacle to the drafting of the legislation?</P>

The matter of the timeframe is being dealt with by the all-party committee on the Constitution which will look at the area of fundamental rights, including the equality amendment to which I referred, recommended by the Constitution Review Group, that Article 40.1 be amended. I have given the wording to the Deputy. There are no proposals to advance constitutional amendments in areas beyond those identified by the Constitution Review Group in its report which has been referred to the all-party committee on the Constitution for debate. The committee will debate the wording to be brought forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that we are speaking about two different amendments and that the Minister of State is referring to the amendment dealing with anti-discrimination. I put it to her that in the debates on the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act clear constitutional difficulties were identified, specifically with regard to the rights of people with disabilities, that accommodation rights, in particular, would present an obstacle in extending the rights of such people. Clearly, this issue caused problems for the legislation in question. Will it not also cause a problem when we come to deal with legislation dealing specifically with people with disabilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>The directive on equal treatment in employment and occupation adopted in November 2000 imposed an obligation on employers to provide reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities unless such measures would impose a disproportionate burden on them. This will mean, in effect, that when the directive is given effect in Ireland the ceiling of nominal cost in the Employment Equality Act will no longer apply. It is important to note that the constitutional difficulties we experienced in the early part of 1997 in the initial drafting of the legislation have been overcome. The legislation was redrafted and the two Bills in question have been passed by both Houses.</P>

If she wishes to know what the long-term solution is, all she need do is look at the directive passed last November.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the cut from £61 million to £25 million in the capital allocation for child care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me set the record straight in terms of my Department's capital allocation for child care to which the Deputy refers as there appears to be misinformation in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's total allocation for child care for 2001 is £69.716 million, of which £25.870 million relates to capital expenditure. The remaining £43.846 million is allocated to current expenditure such as staffing grants for community based/not-for-profit groups and quality improvement projects such as training programmes and <Col N="1214" /> supports for the national voluntary child care organisations.</P>
    <P>My Department has been allocated £250 million for child care, both capital and current, under the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006. This allocation has been supplemented by an Exchequer investment of £94 million, giving a total of £344 million to be expended by my Department to end 2006. This represents the most significant investment in child care by any Government in the history of the State. There has been no reduction in the overall allocation for child care over the period of the national development plan. However, in the initial stage of the equal opportunities child care programme, there has been a reprofiling of the expenditure due to the start-up nature of the programme in 2000 and 2001. It is expected that expenditure on the programme will rise significantly from 2002 as work on approved capital projects progresses.</P>
    <P>To date, we have committed capital funding to 227 child care providers, both in the community and private sector, totalling just over £13 million, of which almost £1.75 million had been drawn down up to 30 March 2001. In accordance with Government financial procedures, funding for capital projects is only released as work progresses and completed. This capital funding will support almost 7,000 child care places, including the establishment of over 3,700 new child care places. In recent days, we announced the latest round of funding of which just over £1.5 million was allocated in capital funding.</P>
    <P>The difference between the amounts committed and the amounts paid out to date reflects the fact that payments are made in stages as work progresses. In many cases it has been found that building contractors are unable to commence work on capital projects as soon as had been expected due to other work commitments, thus delaying the commencement of projects and the draw down of funds.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the funding schemes were launched at the end of April 2000 and the first allocation of funding under the equal opportunities child care programme, 2000 to 2006, was released until mid-July 2000. This start date was due to the fact that funding could not be allocated until the operational programmes and the Community Support Framework was agreed between Ireland and the European Union.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation for child care for 2001 according to the abridged Estimates volume published late last year was £35.870 million. This was revised for the current year in the revised Estimates volume to £25.870 million. It must be stressed that the revised figure is our best estimate of what we can spend in 2001 of the overall allocation, which remains intact. However, we can only allocate funds as applications are received and, as outlined above, payments are made in stages which reflect the progress of capital work.</P>
    <P>I again reassure the Deputy of the Government's continued commitment to the advance<Col N="1215" /> ment of child care service delivery and that the overall allocation for childcare remains intact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan:</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from what the Minister of State said that the restructuring of the equal opportunities child care programme means, in effect, less money is being spent on child care than originally intended? Is there a difficulty in drawing down the money made available? Is the money being drawn down, or is there a lower take-up than originally expected? If so, will the Minister of State consider broadening the parameters of bodies which may apply under the equal opportunities child care programme? I think she will agree that there is a huge crisis. People in need of child care are unable to receive or afford it. Yet, it appears that funds are not being spent under the programme. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the position in that regard. The press statements I have read indicate that the original amount allocated is not being spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can rest assured that there has been no reduction in the overall allocation for the programme. Our difficulty, if any, is that we are not receiving applications fast enough to allocate and get applicants to spend money quickly. The Minister announced the programme last April and allocated the first grants in July. We are forwarding applications to ADM for processing as they come in the door. We are moving as fast as we possibly can. The Deputy should note that there is a difference between grants allocated and moneys expended. One allocates a capital grant to a project for the construction of a building while one hands out the money in stages as building work progresses. Money is not handed out at the start. The same applies to staffing grants which are only paid when the staff are in place.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State saying that the allocation has not been cut back from £61 million to £25 million, as reported? She has indicated that enormous amounts of money are being spent on child care, but the reality on the ground is that that money is not reaching those who are trying to provide child care places. A sum of £841,000 was allocated to Cork by way of capital grants up to 31 December, not one penny of which has been drawn down. The figure for Dublin is £2 million, of which less than £54,000 has been drawn down.</P>

      <P>Section 8(5) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, provides that where it appears to an immigration officer or an authorised officer in the office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that a child under the age of 18 years, who has either arrived at the frontiers of the State or has entered the State, is not in the custody of any person, the officer shall, as soon as practicable, so inform the health board in whose functional area the child is. The provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, which require every health board to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection, will then apply in relation to the child. All health boards have nominated liaison officers to be the contact person for the immigration officer or authorised officer in this regard.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the Refugee Act, 1996, further provides for the making of an application for refugee status on behalf of a child by an officer appointed by the health board where this is deemed appropriate in the light of information available about the case. Draft guidelines prepared by a working group established by my Department in respect of these provisions of the Act have been circulated to the health boards. I understand from the Department of Health and Children that the immediate and ongoing needs of the young person, including accommodation, medical, social and educational needs, are followed up by a social worker, community welfare officer or project worker, as appropriate.</P>

Does he support the recommendation of that centre that the Department of Health and Children should ensure there is a parent figure available to look after any such minors? Is there a formal structure of liaison between his departmental refugee officials and the health boards throughout the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been, as the Deputy indicated, a huge increase in the numbers of minors being dealt with by the health boards. In 1999 the numbers were 94, in 2000 the number was 517 and this year to date the number is 312. Statistics for the year 2000 show that almost 50%, or 256, of the 517 unaccompanied minors who presented for asylum were 17 years of age. A further 31%, or 159, were either 15 or 16, while the remainder were under 15. So far this year 207 or 66% of unaccompanied minors dealt with by <Col N="1218" /> the health boards have stated their age as either 16 or 17.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that unaccompanied minors arriving in the State are given very careful treatment. There is a liaison officer. There is a major effort made to ensure that the child or minor concerned is given early and satisfactory accommodation and is cared for to the very highest level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this serious matter. Donegal has suffered from a lack of infrastructural development, be it road, rail or telecommunication infrastructure. At a time when this Government, through its national development plan, is underpinning the importance of developing fibre-optic and broad band communications, we in Donegal were shocked to read in <i>The Irish Times </i>on Friday last, that Eircom has pulled out of the State subsidised 37 million project to provide both fibre optics and the dual subscriber lines technology to the Border, midlands and western region. This affects Buncrana in particular.</P>
      <P>The technology would have provided high speed Internet multi-media services over ordinary telephone lines. Donegal was looking forward to the benefits of the funding which the Government had committed. Eircom was awarded a 12.4 million contract for the project under the national development plan as a means of bridging the growing digital divide between Dublin and the regional towns. However, Eircom management has vetoed the project according to the newspaper article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to confirm whether the project is gone and what we do now. I want a commitment that we will not give up and that an alternative company will be brought in to ensure that this proposal and this long awaited project brings vital telecommunications infrastructure to my area. I want an undertaking that this will not be hindered by Eircom's withdrawal, should that withdrawal be confirmed. It is understood that management dropped the plan because of global retrenchment in the telecommunications market and a sceptical approach to expensive new technologies such as DSL. It is strange that places such as Donegal <Col N="1219" /> are seen as &ldquo;expensive.&rdquo; Expense would be no hindrance in other main centres. We should be supplied with this facility, particularly as the money is provided through the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The people of Donegal have worked hard to overcome the serious implications of recent job losses. Everyone in every sphere has moved to do what is asked by the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, State bodies and those in the know. We have moved toward diversification. Even the county council is running ECDL courses to bring us up to speed. FÁS, the local partnerships, the Leader groups, community groups are all pushing computer education. Those who have lost their jobs in the recent years rebelled initially against computer training but now that they have done courses they are proud of themselves for the experience they have gained. There are new companies in Moville, such as Iontas and there are other computer companies in Buncrana.</P>
    <P>We have risen to the challenge but we need an IT infrastructure developed and enhanced. We deserve positive discrimination. We not only need the line that was supposed to be coming, but we also need a Malin Head to Mizen Head approach, preferably starting at Malin Head and moving to Mizen Head. We need an east-west link within Donegal. I implore the Minister to act. I know there is commitment in Government to supply what we were given funding for.</P>
    <P>If it is confirmed, I deplore Eircom's action in pulling out of such an important aspect of the infrastructural development of my area. Broadband technology is recognised by industry as the only way in which our economic growth can continue. Donegal needs such growth more than any other county. I do not agree that Donegal is a peripheral county but if this infrastructure is not provided to assist companies to grow, irrespective of their physical location, the county has no future. This is a very serious day in my political career and I urge the Minister to find an alternative company to take up this proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob):</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Friday, 6 April, <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that Eircom had pulled out of a national development plan supported 37 million project to provide fibre optics and digital subscriber line &ndash; DSL &ndash; technologies to the Border, midlands and western region. The contract offered to Eircom by the Minister for Public Enterprise was in fact for a national project which covered the south and east region as well as the BMW region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eircom was offered this contract under the first round of funding announced by the Minister for Public Enterprise in January of this year. Under such a contract, Eircom would have received up to 12.4 million in NDP support, with a total project cost of 36.7 million. Through the contract, Eircom would have been supported by the Exchequer and the European Regional Develop<Col N="1220" /> ment Fund in providing DSL technology to a large number of Eircom switches in virtually every county in Ireland. This technology would have enhanced Internet access in many parts of regional Ireland. In particular, it would have allowed for high speed Internet access at small business and residential level.</P>
    <P>Despite some flexibility being offered by the Minister to Eircom, it has decided not to proceed with the contract. This is the result of a review of capital infrastructure within the company. From a national communications policy perspective, the Minister for Public Enterprise considers it unfortunate that the incumbent telecommunications company, Eircom, is not planning to offer extensive DSL services at this juncture. Most incumbents across Europe, including Deutsche Telecom, BT and France Telecom have decided to do so on an extensive scale.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister continues to support a broad range of communications infrastructure projects under both NDPs which will ensure a high penetration of broadband technologies around the country. In the specific case of Donegal, the withdrawal of the Eircom contract will restrict the level of Internet service offered by Eircom in that county but only to the same extent as it is being limited in other counties. Donegal has, however, received extensive allocations of NDP communications measure funding.</P>
    <P>In 1999, Eircom was allocated 2.4 million in INTERREG aid for the deployment of a 95 kilometre fibre link along the west coast of Donegal from Bunbeg to Donegal town, and from Dunfanaghy to Falcarragh. In all, 71,000 people will benefit from this new improved infrastructure. The total cost of this project is 4.737 million and the EU aid element is 2.3685 million. Work is in progress and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2001.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, the Minister is supporting communications infrastructure in Donegal being carried out by Chorus. This project, at a total cost of 17.8 million, involves a wireless link from Castlebar to Buncrana <i>via</i> Ballina, Sligo, Donegal town and Letterkenny. The Minister is also supporting a national project with ESBI at a total cost of 49.2 million. This project involves the deployment of up to 1,107 kilometres of fibre optic cable to 17 locations around the county by means of a fibre wrap on the existing electricity network. The fibre will be provided to Donegal by two routes, from Sligo to Buncrana <i>via</i> Ballyshannon and Letterkenny and from Dundalk to Ballyshannon. As these projects are implemented, the range of broadband services offered in Donegal will increase substantially and should result in better services and more competitive pricing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea:</NameTxt>
      <P>The report produced last week under the chairmanship of Mr. Phil Flynn has profound implications for the future of the post <Col N="1221" /> office network. It paints an alarming picture suggesting that post offices are technically bankrupt and that, unless immediate action is taken, many post offices, particularly sub-post offices, will face early closure.</P>
      <P>The post office has traditionally played a central role in the fabric of Irish life. It is not merely a place in which one posts letters, collects social welfare payments or pays the television licence. For many people it is a vital point of contact with the rest of the community. Rural Ireland has suffered the serious disintegration of much of its infrastructure. Railways have been closed and the number of bus routes reduced. The bank network is diminishing and village shops and pubs are closing. Against that background, the collapse of the post office network would be a body blow.</P>
      <P>Post office services in Dublin are also in crisis due to rising rents and staff shortages. While there has not been any formal closure of post offices in recent years, the network has reduced through natural wastage. When an office closes, it is difficult to get anyone to take it over, primarily due to an inadequate remuneration system.</P>
      <P>The seriousness of this situation must be recognised. The current position is a recipe for disaster. The Flynn report points out that the network stands to lose more than £83 million in a no-change scenario. A secure future for the post office network requires the consolidation of existing business and diversification into new areas. It is also essential that the network's social dimension is recognised and we must ensure that any EU directive which may impact on the network does so.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's recent announcement that post offices are to take over some of the payments currently operated by bank branches. However, it is disappointing, given the urgent need to find new business, that An Post has not yet introduced any new savings product to take advantage of the scheme provided for in the recent Finance Act which is due to come into operation in May. All the major banks and financial institutions are already heavily promoting new savings products. If An Post wishes to get a share of this business it is essential that it moves now.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the Flynn report, the Minister announced the establishment of an interdepartmental working group to consider its implications. I hope this is a genuine attempt to find a solution to the plight of the post offices, not simply an effort to kick an awkward problem to touch until after the next general election. The Government has stated that it will not permit any further post office closures but it must source business to ensure these offices remain open and viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the public find it difficult to access a variety of services. Why can more of these services not be made available to post offices? Why should every post office not have an Internet link available to the public? The Money Advisory Bureau, MABs, is playing an important role in <Col N="1222" /> helping people on low incomes with their budgets. Could we integrate the MABs into the post office system? These are just some of the potential areas of new business that might be looked at, and I am sure there are many others.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion in recent years about the future of the post offices. Meanwhile, the problems have mounted. It is time for decisions. I urge the Minister to put a deadline on the deliberations of the interdepartmental committee. It must report urgently and appropriate decisions must be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for raising this important matter which is close to everyone's heart throughout the country and in our constituencies .</P>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, requested Phil Flynn to carry out his review of the sub-post office network in February last year in the context of the Government's explicit commitment to the retention of the rural sub-post office network in the White Paper on rural development and given that regional and rural development are cornerstones of the Government's economic and social development policy.</P>
      <P>Mr. Flynn's terms of reference were two-fold. First, to review the financial and business environment of the sub-post office network and, second, to examine options and make recommendations on the sustainable development of the rural sub-post office network against the background of the obligations of An Post to provide a nationwide service. There is no doubt Mr. Flynn's report makes worrying reading. The report points out that losses are escalating and unsustainable, not just in rural post offices but in urban centres. The greatest increase in losses will arise from the cities and towns rather than rural sub-post offices.</P>
      <P>The facts as outlined in the report are stark. The company operates a network of 1,913 offices. This is the highest <i>per capita</i> in the EU. Some 97 of these are staffed by the company and 1,816 are sub-contracted offices. A significant proportion of these sub-offices are loss making with a very small volume of transactions. Approximately 80% of counter business takes place in the 400 largest offices, leaving 1,500 servicing the remaining 20% of transactions. Business volume growth over the period 1992-98 in the bottom 913 sub-offices was just 2.5% in a period of high growth in the economy generally. Business volume growth at the 600 busiest offices over the same period was 38% with the next busiest 400 offices achieving a growth rate of 11%.</P>
      <P>The post office division made a loss of almost £3 million in 2000 on a turnover of £83 million. Due to increasing costs and falling margins, further significant losses are projected by the management of An Post, based on current tariffs and the existing network structure, rising from £12 million this year to almost £28 million in 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> Finally, the post office division is critically dependent on just three contracts for 80% of its revenue, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for social welfare payments, the National Treasury Management Agency for saving services and RTE for licence collection. These customers are held under short-term contracts, all of which are either currently or shortly up for renewal.</P>
    <P>The implications of the report for the network are clear. The current situation, which I have briefly outlined, is unsustainable and threatens the continuation of the existing level of services as well as the future viability of An Post.</P>
    <P>The Flynn report outlines a wide range of scenarios, options and recommendations to guarantee the future viability of the network. In light of the report, the Minister announced on 4 April that the Government has decided to establish an inter-departmental group to provide a blueprint for the future funding of the post office network. The group will comprise senior officials who will engage in a consultative process with relevant parties which will feed back into the final proposals the Minister for Public Enterprise shall then bring to Government. This key group of top civil servants will make recommendations to the Minister arising from their assessment of the Flynn study.</P>
    <P>We are at a cross-roads in relation to the network of post office counter services and the Minister wishes to ensure that she has the best advice available to Government. She is confident that the required solutions will be found and reaffirms her personal commitment to the provision of top quality postal services to both the rural and urban communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 2000, the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation published the regulatory framework for access to the mobile market. The report stated that mobile operators such as Eircell, which have been designated as having significant market power on the national network for interconnection, are obliged to provide interconnection at cost orientated rates. On this basis, Imagine, an Irish company, entered discussions with Eircell. However, Imagine had difficulty in dealing with Eircell and asked the ODTR to intervene. The management by ODTR of the dispute between Eircell and Imagine raises serious questions. The ODTR has been slow to furnish information to Imagine. It has remained indecisive in relation to its power and how it intends to enforce its policy as stated in July 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indecision by the regulator is highlighted by the fact that Imagine, the only competition to the two main players in the marketplace, has been waiting up to nine months for a decision from the Director of Telecommunications and she has not to date indicated when such a decision will be <Col N="1224" /> made. Imagine is now facing collapse with the loss of more than 250 jobs and the withdrawal of investment of £20 million, creating an additional 100 jobs, of which £5 million would be invested in the midland region. What is more worrying is the fact that it is taking the sole competitor out of the market which is not just damaging to competition and the consumer, which is facing a 25% increase in mobile phone charges, but is damaging the country's reputation and competitive advantage within the EU.</P>
    <P>Ireland currently has one of the highest mobile phone charges in the EU and remains the only country with a sole competitor to the main players, Eircell and Esat Digifone. The director has failed to enforce her own policy for opening up access within the mobile market and has further compounded this by failing to decide on the dispute resolution request within six months, contrary to the EU directives. It is clear from the EU interconnection directive that the ODTR is legally obliged to ensure agreement between both parties. However, she claims that the current legislation is a grey area, contrary to the Minister's claims.</P>
    <P>It is clear from that directive that Article 3 of the interconnectivity directive obliges Ireland to have adopted into law the removal of restrictions to ensure negotiations take place in relation to interconnectivity agreements and authorises the Government to ensure public telecommunications networks and services are opened up to competition. Article 4 of the same directive provides Imagine with the legal right to negotiate and directs the ODTR to ensure such agreements are not hindered by Eircell. It is clearly stated in Article 4 that a company such as Eircell must meet all reasonable requests for access to the network. It is blatantly obvious this is not happening at present.</P>
    <P>Article 3.1 clearly states that any negotiations or discussions must be in line with the competition rules of the Amsterdam Treaty, which is not happening at present. Both Eircell and Esat have market dominance within the marketplace. There is little competition at present. Eircell must provide access and not contravene EU competition law. As a consequence, there is no restriction to the obligation on the ODTR to ensure and facilitate the negotiations and ensure they are fulfilled and delivered on.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a point in relation to significant market player designation. There has been no designation since the 1998 statistics. Esat should also come under that category. The ODTR has not reviewed that situation and that should be done immediately. Why has it not been done to date? It is done annually in other EU countries. There are serious question marks over the handling of this by the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation. She claims she does not have the legislative power to do that at present. I ask that that legislation be expedited immediately so that the ODTR and the office of <Col N="1225" /> the Minister do not continue to break articles of the interconnectivity directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for raising this important issue. An efficient and effective communications sector is a prerequisite for Ireland to derive maximum advantage from the benefits of the information society and e-commerce in particular in the shortest possible time. The Communications (Regulation) Bill will propose a reform of the regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector that will provide a favourable environment for further investment and development and improved service. The Minister for Public Enterprise, as Minister responsible for telecommunications matters, is intent on ensuring the speedy passage of the Communications (Regulation) Bill through the various Stages necessary for its enactment.</P>
      <P>The existing regulatory framework for the telecommunications sector is substantially based on European directives. In July 2000, the European Commission published proposals for the reform of the regulatory framework for the sector which were designed to accelerate the benefits of competition and enable Europe to reap the benefits of the information society. The enactment of the Bill will enable Ireland to effectively manage the transition from the current regulatory framework to the proposed new one and will help to put us among the early adopters of the new European framework.</P>
      <P>The main provisions of the Bill will be as follows: to replace the Director of Telecommunications Regulation with a commission for communications regulation with appropriate arrangements for the transfer of staff and functions to the director to the commission, to broaden the scope of the powers of the commission in the exercise of its functions in light of the emerging EU regulatory framework and to improve the powers of enforcement of the commission's decisions, to reform the legislative framework governing the opening of public roads by telecommunications operators, to implement other policy proposals set out in the governance and accountability in the regulatory process paper, including the enhancement of the transparency and accountability of the new commission to the Oireachtas and the public and provision for an appropriate relationship between the commission and the Competition Authority in areas of common concern and to include the recently adopted regulation of the European Parliament and Council mandating local loop unbundling from January 2001 within the enforcement powers of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, in accordance with the new European regulatory framework for the sector, will enable the proposed commission for communications regulation to impose obligations on operators with significant market power in order to facilitate competition in the sector, including the mobile telephony market. Among the obligations that may be imposed, where appropriate, will be <Col N="1226" /> the requirement on such operators to make available network facilities to other operators to allow the latter to provide services to consumers.</P>
    <P>A draft general scheme of the Bill was published as a consultation paper last autumn following Government approval. More than 20 submissions were received from telecommunications operators, representative bodies, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and a small number of individuals. The draft general scheme was revised in the light of the comments received through the public consultation.</P>
    <P>Following Government approval in March 2001, the general scheme was sent to the office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting as the Communications (Regulation) Bill. It is hoped that the proposed Bill will be published in time for the autumn session this year. The Minister intends to publish the general scheme shortly for the information of those who contributed to the public consultation process on the proposals last autumn and for the information of the public in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to declare a personal interest in the <i>Asgard </i>project. There is a deep emotional tie between my home area in Donegal and the <i>Asgard.</i> On that fateful voyage from the North Sea to Howth there were two men from Gola Island, Gweedore, on board &ndash; Charlie Doogan and Patrick McGinley &ndash; both experienced fishermen who navigated a safe passage. I would be in favour of conservation, preservation or even restoration. I advocated such an approach in the past &ndash; indeed, I think I was in touch with the Minister. However, the present plan is neither &ndash; it is a reproduction and it will leave us with a mere replica of the original craft.</P>
      <P>It is widely recognised that the <i>Asgard </i>is one of our national treasures and played an important and significant role in the emergence of this nation as an independent State. Not only is the yacht a national treasure but it is ranked among the most famous yachts in the world, a unique and significantly important vessel in an international context. Indeed, the Attorney General has declared the vessel an archaeological object within the meaning of the National Monuments Acts, 1930-94. Work to conserve or restore it can be undertaken only under a licence to alter, which has already been issued by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to the <i>Asgard </i>restoration project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licence was issued by the Minister under the most dubious circumstances and has generated wide dismay and concern within the maritime, archaeological and heritage communities of these islands. To assess the licence application and for specialist advice on the implication of the proposal, the Minister consulted statutory bodies such as the Heritage Council and the National Museum of Ireland. I understand Mr. John Kearnon, Head of Shipkeeping, National Museums <Col N="1227" /> and Galleries of Merseyside, was engaged as a specialist consultant. I understand the unanimous advice given to the Minister by the said bodies was to refuse the application.</P>
    <P>There were a number of important reasons for tendering this advice. First, the proposal to restore the <i>Asgard </i>to sailing condition would entail the removal of at least 80% of the original vessel and perhaps significantly more. She can never again be the yacht that Erskine Childers sailed. She will be but a replica with some of the fittings of the<i> Asgard</i> and her historical and structural significance would be greatly reduced in status. Second, the restoration plan in its present form is contrary to the Minister's own published policy guidelines. In her policy document, Framework and Principles for the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage, preservation is the first priority and any form of removal or destruction of elements of the heritage must be the very last option availed of in the event of absolute necessity only. Third, for similar reasons any decision to allow such extensive restoration is in breach of the Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage, 1992, ratified by Ireland in 1997. Ireland is bound to fulfil the terms of the convention. Fourth, the <i>Asgard</i> was built as a gentleman's sailing yacht designed for a small complement of perhaps a maximum of five or six people. It is, therefore, unsuitable for use as a sail training vessel. The nature and scale of the vessel would make her virtually inaccessible to the public were she returned to sail.</P>
    <P>Despite all those valid reasons, the Minister took the unprecedented step of instructing her officials to issue a licence to alter. Does the Minister or, indeed, the Cabinet understand the enormity of what is proposed? This national treasure, a part of our maritime heritage, is being desecrated. Should the Government allow the proposed destruction of the <i>Asgard</i> it would sanction an extraordinary act of cultural vandalism involving an internationally important heritage object.</P>
    <P>Other than the experts and the officials who have advised the Minister, the voices of those who would wish to see the<i> Asgard </i>maintained as near as possible to the original have not yet been heard. It is certain that when the reality of the proposal sinks in, there will be growing opposition at home and abroad. The decision by the Minister to take the unprecedented step of making her decision contrary to the advice of statutory bodies, consultants and officials leaves many questions unanswered.</P>
    <P>I earnestly request the Minister to call a halt to this project. When one considers from where the Minister is coming, one would expect her to have a deeper understanding of the value and significance of one of our great national treasures. When one considers from where the Minister is <Col N="1228" /> coming, one would expect her to have a deeper understanding of the value and significance of one of our great national treasures.<b>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera): </b>Asgard Restoration Project Limited, ARP, is a private company established to restore the <i>Asgard</i> to full sailing condition. The<i> Asgard</i> is an historically important ketch in view of its use for gun running by the Irish Volunteers in 1914. It has an importance also in the broader marine context due to the fact that the vessel is a prime example of the small number of gentlemen's yachts extant from the 32 designed, and four built, by the internationally acclaimed Colin Archer. Ownership of the vessel, which has been located in Kilmainham Gaol since 1968, is vested in the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>In 1998 the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, proffered IR£250,000 to ARP towards its project to restore the<i> Asgard</i> to full seagoing condition, subject to the group obtaining a &ldquo;Licence to Alter&rdquo; the vessel from my Department under the National Monuments Acts. In this context, a decision was required as to the nature of the treatment that would be carried out on the vessel. There were two options in respect of these works: to stabilise and conserve the vessel and confine it to a static role, housed as an exhibit, or to restore the vessel to its former glory and facilitate its return to the sea.</P>
    <P>In view of the vessel's place in Irish history, I decided to consult my colleagues in Government on the matter. The Cabinet agreed that the preservation of the memory of the <i>Asgard</i> would be best served through the vessel's restoration to full sailing condition. Accordingly, a licence under the National Monuments Acts was issued in December 1999, subject to a number of conditions and requirements. I stress that this was a Government decision.</P>
    <P>Recently, ARP requested that it be given possession of the vessel in order to move it from Kilmainham Gaol to the RDS Boat Show, where it was to be used for fundraising in respect of the restoration works. The Minister for Defence agreed to this removal and, in that light, my Department approved the proposal for the storage of the vessel, provided that suitable insurance cover was provided, as well as appropriate accommodation acceptable to the National Museum of Ireland.</P>
    <P>With regard to the current location of the vessel, the National Museum of Ireland has informed the group that the location and security of the vessel is unacceptable. I understand ARP has indicated that it will redress the situation. While I am concerned about the present situation and I am fully aware of the national importance of the <i>Asgard,</i> the National Museum of Ireland, my Department and I will continue to monitor the vessel closely.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 1 May 2001.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána is not legally obliged to inform a suspect of the progress of an investigation. In some circumstances, advising the subject of progress could be counter productive to the successful completion of the investigation. Each case is considered on its merits. If, however, the Director of Public Prosecutions directs that no criminal proceedings are to be taken, then the suspect is advised accordingly.</P>
      <P>I understand that property is returned to the owner when it is no longer required for the purpose of the investigation, or where a court directs. Where any dispute arises as to the ownership of property in the possession of the Garda Síochána, an application may be made to the District Court pursuant to the Police Property Act, 1897, for an order as to the proper disposal of the property.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>On 29 September 2000 the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced that the British Government would no longer pursue the extradition of 21 individuals, including eight from this State, who had been convicted of offences committed prior to the Good Friday Agreement. Those concerned would, under the early release scheme in the Agreement, have had little if any of their original sentence to serve if they returned to Northern Ireland. That decision related only to extradition and did not mean that those concerned were immune from arrest if they returned voluntarily to the North. However, it was made clear that an application for early release in any such case could be made to the sentence review commissioners. This procedure was invoked by some of those involved and last month seven of these persons were released on licence by the sentence review commissioners. An eighth person was, for technical reasons and to avoid an anomaly, given early release using the Royal Prerogative of Mercy.</P>
      <P>As regards this jurisdiction, while the issue of extradition is not relevant, provision has been made in the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act, 1998, in relation to the early release of prisoners in accordance with the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. While procedures I described earlier apply to persons on the run from enforcement of sentence, there are also those who may be on the run with a view to avoiding prosecution. In this regard, in a statement issued at Hillsborough on 8 March, the two Governments recognised that, with the completion of the early release scheme, there was an issue to be addressed about supporters of organisations now on ceasefire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions and, in some cases, extradition proceedings for offences committed before 10 April 1998. The statement recognised that such people would, if convicted, stand to benefit from the early release scheme. The Governments accepted that, in the context of the agreement of May 2000 being implemented, it would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to be pursued and indicated their intention as soon as possible to take such steps as were necessary in their jurisdictions to resolve this difficulty so that those concerned would no longer be pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 46 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 160 on 7 February 2001, statistics for the year 2000 are unavailable but will be published in due course in the Garda Síochána annual report.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Garda investigation into the disappearance of a number of women in the Leinster area, as I have previously informed the House, Operation Trace was established by the Garda Commissioner for the specific purpose of establishing whether any common denominator linked any of six women who went missing in Leinster between 1993 and 1998. I am sure that the House will appreciate the difficulties the Garda faces in investigating these cases because there is no crime scene available for analysis and there is a complete lack of forensic or pathological evidence.</P>
      <P>Each of the cases under review by Operation Trace was originally investigated in depth by the Garda Síochána in the locality of the disappearance. Operation Trace has comprehensively reviewed each of these cases and has yielded new lines of inquiries that have been pursued in conjunction with the original investigation teams. Furthermore, a unique database (OVID, offenders, victims and incidents) has been devised which facilitates cross-referencing of information generated by each case. While progress has been slow and time-consuming, the Garda authorities consider that the operation has been worth while.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Garda structures for investigating missing persons, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the district officer for each area is responsible for the overall investigation for each missing person, including all searches, and that an investigation team which draws together any specialist resources the district officer decides are necessary to locate a missing person is put in place. In addition, every district has a specially trained search team familiar with the locality. At division level, investigations are co-ordinated by the relevant chief superintendent. An administrative and statistical function is maintained at the missing persons bureau in Garda headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities assure me that the effectiveness of the working methods and procedures <Col N="1232" /> employed in missing persons cases are continually reviewed. As a result of this, substantial changes were made in 1998, such as the introduction of new guidelines and procedures which place a particular emphasis on keeping the families of missing persons informed by a liaison officer who deals with a designated family member.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that he has full confidence in the existing Operation Trace and, as with all Garda operations, Operation Trace is under continual review to ensure that it is effective in achieving its purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF) commits every Department to taking appropriate action to ensure agencies under its aegis achieve the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities in the public service at an early date. Consequently, I have no plans to review the 3% target during the lifetime of the programme.</P>
      <P>To address this commitment we established a monitoring committee in 1999. The monitoring committee is responsible for monitoring the achievement of the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities in the public service, excluding the Civil Service. The Department of Finance is responsible for monitoring progress in the Civil Service. The membership of the committee is comprised of representatives from Departments, employers, trade unions and the disability interest groups.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee seeks to support Departments in pursuing the achievement of the target. Over the past two years the committee has:</P>
      <P>Approved a draft code of practice for use in the public service;</P>
      <P>Raised awareness of the 3% target by giving information to chief executives, personnel officers and disability equality officers in the public service through:</P>
      <P>&ndash;a series of eight regional seminars,</P>
      <P>&ndash;publication of an information brochure,</P>
      <P>&ndash;research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations. A report on this research is due to be published in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The awareness raising, information giving and research initiatives were undertaken with the approval of the committee in partnership by my Department and the Equality Authority. I am confident that the benefits of these initiatives will <Col N="1233" /> be reflected in the statistical returns of the organisations concerned during the coming years.</P>

      <P>As I previously stated in my answer of 1 March 2001, the European Committee against Torture did not issue an annual report for the year 1996. The report referred to by the Deputy is titled &ldquo;7th General Report on the CPT's activities covering the period 1 January to 31 January 1996&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The report recommends that, when an immigration detainee must be accommodated in a prison, he should be held separately from other prisoners. Usually the periods of detention in the prison system are short, ranging from one overnight to a weekend. Only in exceptional cases are immigration detainees held in the prison system for more than two or three overnights. As I stated in my previous answer in relation to this matter, immigration detainees are accommodated in either the training unit, Mountjoy Prison, the Dóchas Centre, Cork Prison or Limerick Prison. Where immigration detainees are held in Mountjoy Prison, they are normally separated from sentenced prisoners and are not placed in cells with convicted offenders. It is not possible at present to segregate immigration detainees from other prisoners at Cork or Limerick Prisons. In practice the majority of immigration detainees are held in single cell accommodation in the training unit. The training unit is a drug free place of detention near Mountjoy which operates a relatively relaxed regime within a secure perimeter. Restrictions there are kept to a minimum consistent with order and control. Obviously in a setting like this it is impossible to keep immigration detainees separated from other prisoners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles and Deeds that the income of the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds for 2000 amounted to £34 million for services provided and applications lodged.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that the total direct expenditure in the registries for 2000 was £17 million. In addition, I am informed that the notional costs for superannuation, accommodation and services provided by other Departments amounted to £4.3 million and that the total cost of pensions for existing staff amounts to £2.5 million.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that, under Government accounting rules and taking account of notional costs, the registries had a surplus of £12.7 million during 2000. However, under accrual accounting rules the real surplus of the registries amounts to £0.5 million.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, arising out of the current buoyancy in the economy, the intake of applications in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds continues to grow at an unprecedented level with each successive year setting new record levels. The total intake of new cases for the year 2000 amounted to 161,844. This represents an increase of 29,485 over the 1999 intake.</P>
      <P>In addition to the increase in property transactions, major infrastructural projects undertaken by the bodies responsible for systems and utilities, for example, Bord Gáis, ESB, Coillte, National Roads Authority, Bord na Móna, etc., have also placed considerable strain on the registry's ability to provide essential services. In the circumstances, the staff in the Land Registry have worked very hard to give the best possible service to their customers.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, to address this problem, I received sanction from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to increase the staffing complement of the Land Registry by 82. The resultant appointments are being made following a recruitment drive by the Civil Service Commission which is beginning to pay dividends.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the management and staff of the Land Registry to address the arrears situation which has developed over a period of time, mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the levels of business. The Land Registry management are implementing some proactive measures to help deal with the situation. These include improvements to workflow, the training and development of staff, the use of new technology, the launch of an e-commerce service and the computerised data capture of folios and maps. I am confident that, with the appointment of additional staff and the programme of measures being taken, the situation will improve.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, under the strategic management initiative, a fundamental review of all aspects of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána was completed in 1997. The Government appointed a steering group in February 1998 to develop and implement its recommendations. The aim is to position the Garda organisation to respond efficiently and effectively to the challenges it faces in this new millennium.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been achieved in a number of projects, including financial management, human resource management, training and promotion, civilianisation, rostering and quality service. All projects are being developed in full consultation with staff associations.</P>
      <P>The particular review referred to by the Deputy is a review of the Garda structures and operating systems. In December 2000 consultants were recruited to carry out this comprehensive and complex review. Under the terms of reference, the consultants are required to develop the HQ and regional organisations structures, review the HQ specific and core role functions, review roles of ranks and develop criteria in relation to stations. In completing the work programme, the consultants must evaluate a range of options identified under the SMI programme and make clear recommendations.</P>
      <P>In assessing the criteria in relation to stations, I understand that the consultants will be focusing on the best use of Garda resources to deliver a policing service to the community. Contrary to recent media reports, the consultants will not be recommending the closure of any Garda stations but will be highlighting criteria which could be taken account of in any future assessment of how the functions or location of Garda stations best serve the community. I want to make it absolutely clear that I have no proposals in relation to the closure of any Garda station.</P>
      <P>The consultants will not report until August or September this year. The recommendations in their report will then be considered by the Garda SMI steering group and, ultimately, by Government. </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Guidelines in the form of a Government decision taken in March 1993 were issued to all Departments. The Government decided that Ministers should endeavour to have a minimum of 40% of both men and women among the chairs of boards of State bodies and among other persons nominated by Ministers to State bodies under their aegis. The Government further decided that all Ministers should advise bodies nominating persons to boards under their aegis of the Government's gender balance policy and ask them formally to follow a similar practice. These guidelines were extended in March 1995 to include advisory committees, visiting committees, committees of a temporary nature, etc.</P>
      <P>Each Minister is responsible for implementing the Government's gender balance policy in his or her own area. My Department monitors the progress in appointing women to State boards on a quarterly basis and keeps the situation under review.</P>
      <P>The figures for membership of State boards on 31 December 2000 show that 28% of the total serving membership were women. This figure needs to be broken down between persons nominated by Ministers and those nominated by others. In the case of ministerial nominees, 34% were women. In the case of nominees by other bodies, 21% were women. Women comprised 18% of chairs of boards.</P>
      <P>With regard to appointments made over the year 2000, 36% of the persons nominated by Ministers were women and 24% of those nominated by other bodies were women. I am anxious that more progress is made towards reaching the 40% target. We have to address this matter both in terms of persons nominated by Ministers, where we have more control and where we are nearer to the 40% target, and in terms of persons nominated by other bodies, where the gap between the target and the current position is wider. My Department is reviewing the matter and I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Cabinet shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>Joyriding is a complex issue which, while requiring significant inputs from the criminal justice system, can only be tackled to <Col N="1237" /> meaningful and lasting effect through a multi-faceted and multi-agency response involving the community and relevant statutory bodies.</P>
      <P>In considering the incidence of this amalgam of illegal and dangerous behaviours involving mechanically propelled vehicles, due regard must be had to the significant increase in vehicle numbers on our roads in recent years. In fact, the number of unauthorised takings per 1,000 mechanically propelled vehicles was the second lowest ever recorded in 1999 &ndash; the last year for which published statistics are available &ndash; and was the lowest in 1998. In absolute terms, the number of unauthorised takings recorded in 1999 is more than 28% lower than that recorded in 1982.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána is devoting a significant level of resources to combating this form of crime. The Garda authorities continually monitor trends in unauthorised takings with a view to identifying and targeting persistent offenders and areas prone to such activities. Where considered necessary, intelligence-driven measures are put in place to address the problem at local level. Moreover, each Garda division has a traffic unit which, outside of peak traffic hours, targets incidents of joyriding.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána works closely with other statutory and voluntary organisations on an ongoing basis with a view to addressing the problem comprehensively. Evidence of this can be seen in the involvement of the Garda Síochána in both the south Dublin inter-agency working group on joyriding/anti-social activity and the Priorswood task force on joyriding. As the Deputy is aware, the latter group produced a highly professional research report which I officially launched in February and to which my Department and the Garda authorities are giving full consideration.</P>
      <P>In terms of preventative activities, I have significantly increased the number of Garda youth diversion projects, from 12 in 1997 to 51 at present, with a view to diverting young people away from this and other forms of crime. I also understand that Garda juvenile liaison officers and community gardaí avail of every opportunity during the course of their work, particularly in implementing the schools programme, to educate young persons to the dangers posed by joyriding. I am further informed that members of the Garda Síochána give crime prevention advice on ways to reduce this type of offence through Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert and other similar programmes.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the effects of so-called joyriding on community life, and I am confident that the range of measures being developed by my Department and the Garda Síochána will serve to combat the problem and to maintain law and order. </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the re-admission agreement with Nigeria is, <i>inter alia</i>, to provide an agreed and structured mechanism within which the repatriation of Nigerian nationals can be effected. It obviates the necessity for the making of <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements with the Nigerian authorities on a case by case basis as is the situation at present. However, it is important to bear in mind that, in the context of deportation, for example, the agreement cannot be invoked until the decision to deport has been made in accordance with national legislative procedures and a deportation order has been signed by me.</P>
      <P>The Immigration Act, 1999, sets out in statutory form and in an open and transparent way the principles, powers and procedures governing the deportation process. These principles include a requirement that the person be given a 15 day period within which to make representations as to why a deportation order should not be made. Even if representations are not made, I am required to have regard to a range of 11 different factors, including humanitarian considerations, in determining whether or not a deportation order should be made.</P>
      <P>Lastly, but most important the making of a deportation order is subject to section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, which absolutely forbids the sending of a person &ldquo;in any manner whatsoever&rdquo; to a place where the life or freedom of the person would be threatened on account of that person's race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. This overarching principle is the bedrock of Ireland's repatriation framework and cannot be circumvented by the provisions of a repatriation agreement to which the State becomes a party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, the procedures of any such agreement, including the Nigerian agreement, cannot be invoked in an individual case in <Col N="1239" /> advance of the foregoing provisions of national legislation being applied. It is also open to a person who is not satisfied with the manner in which national legislative provisions have been applied to challenge the validity of any deportation order made by way of an application for judicial review in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of the Illegal Immigrants Trafficking Act, 2000, and legal aid is available for that purpose. Some 78 such cases involving Nigerian nationals are before the courts at present.</P>
    <P>Since the Immigration Act, 1999, came into operation in November 1999, only eight Nigerian nationals have been deported from the State. A further 162 have evaded deportation orders and 47 cannot be located for the purpose of service of such orders.</P>
    <P>The proposed re-admission agreement between Ireland and Nigeria was approved by the Government on 27 March 2001. It is my intention to sign the agreement as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made. Thereafter, as this is an international agreement which will involve a charge upon public funds, its terms must, under Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution, be approved by Dáil Éireann for it to be binding on the State. Provision is made in the agreement that it will not come into force until Ireland and Nigeria notify each other of completion of domestic procedures required for its entry into force. I will table the necessary resolution in the House at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>This will be the fourth re-admission agreement to be entered into by the State. Following Government authorisation on 18 April 2000 I signed a re-admission agreement with Romania on 12 May 2000. The agreement was subsequently approved by the House on 29 June 2000 and has recently been ratified by the Romanian authorities. I also received Government authorisation on 22 January 2001 to arrange for the signature of re-admission agreements with Poland and Bulgaria and I expect to sign these agreements in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I informed the House on 22 March, to mark the occasion of the UN International Day <Col N="1240" /> Against Racism on 21 March, I issued a statement affirming the Government's determination to combat any tendency towards racism and racist acts and calling for support in creating a society which is devoid of prejudice and discrimination.</P>
    <P>In February, I announced the composition of the high level steering group to implement the three year national anti-racism public awareness programme. The group had its first meeting recently and is working on a strategy for the implementation of the programme. The overall aim of the programme is to contribute to creating the conditions for building a more inclusive and intercultural society in Ireland where racism is effectively addressed and cultural diversity is valued.</P>
    <P>The awareness programme will receive Government funding of £4.5 million over a three year period. This funding will enable the group to design and implement a comprehensive set of actions aimed at ensuring that racism does not gain a foothold in our society.</P>
    <P>I also welcomed the large number of activities which had been organised to focus attention on the international day. These included an activity pack for schools entitled, Raising Awareness &ndash; Diversity and Racism, which was produced by the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism in partnership with the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. The activity pack is designed to provide ideas for those working with young people in schools or more informal education settings who are interested in exploring cultural diversity and raising awareness about racism. The pack is consistent with our preparations for the forthcoming public awareness programme against racism.</P>
    <P>I also welcomed the initiative of the Garda racial and intercultural office in producing the Garda anti-racism training video entitled, Challenge It, the anti-racism week in third level colleges organised by the Union of Students in Ireland, and a football tournament between invited youth groups organised by Pavee Point traveller centre. Other highlights marking the occasion were special local radio programmes, concerts, open days and seminars. Unfortunately, some events had to be postponed due to the foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>
    <P>To coincide with the occasion, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees launched a UNHCR video for primary schools. The video is available free of charge from the UNHCR office in Dublin. RTE also announced the expansion of its One World service. One World is a multi-cultural radio service, broadcasting on the medium wave band which reflects the ethnic diversity of refugees, asylum seekers and the immigrant communities in Ireland. It employs a number of reporters from those communities and provides news in different languages.</P>
    <P>The results of the Eurobarometer 2000 survey were published recently. The survey was carried by the European monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia and it reported on attitudes towards <Col N="1241" /> minority groups and immigrants in the European Union. The survey was a follow up to a similar study carried out during the European Year Against Racism in 1997. The overall results show that in some ways attitudes in the EU have changed for the better. However, the results also indicate a negative development, that is, an increase in people worrying about unemployment, loss of social welfare and a drop in educational standards and who, at the same time, blame minorities for the changes. The results found that attitudes in Ireland towards minorities were similar to the attitudes of other Europeans. However, it also revealed, in the case of Ireland, that there was an increase in expressions of insecurity on account of minority groups.</P>
    <P>In his statement of 21 March, the Taoiseach mentioned Ireland's ratification of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. He also referred to our national preparations for the UN World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance. I will be attending the world conference in South Africa later this year.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Garda that there is no evidence of trafficking in women from the Baltic countries to this jurisdiction for the purpose of sexual exploitation. There is, of course, no room for complacency on an issue of this gravity and members of the Garda liaise with Interpol and Europol to keep abreast of current trends in the modus operandi of traffickers. The Garda National Immigration Bureau, which was established in May 2000, has as one of its primary objectives the co-ordination and direction of strategies to combat trafficking in illegal immigrants and the Government has also approved the strengthening of Garda international liaison arrangements by placing of Garda liaison officers in London and Paris for the purpose of interacting with local law enforcement authorities on immigration and trafficking matters. The Deputy will also be aware that the Illegal Immigrations (Trafficking) Act, 2000, came into effect on 5 September 2000. The purpose of this Act is to target the profiteer or professional traffickers in human beings by creating an offence of trafficking in illegal immigrants and asylum seekers and providing a framework by which those engaging in such trafficking can be dealt with under the law. The Deputy will also be interested to note <Col N="1242" /> that the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime, and the protocol to this convention to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, were signed by Ireland in December of last year. In addition, my Department is currently involved in negotiations on a draft EU framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings. This decision will be a comprehensive one and will take full account of current activities and developments in this unscrupulous practice. When the negotiations have successfully concluded, I will introduce any legislation that is necessary to update our current law to ensure that the framework decisions and the UN Protocol are fully implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the firm policy of both my Department and the Prison Service to take all possible measures, short of the kind of searches that would be considered abusive, to prevent drugs getting into prisons. This approach is followed in Mountjoy Prison and all the other constituent facilities in the Irish Prison Service. Habitual drug abusers are of course more numerous in the committal institutions in the Dublin area which have large daily committals of prisoners, many of whom have backgrounds of years of drug abuse which they actively seek to maintain while in custody. Considerable ingenuity and guile is practised by some of these prisoners and their suppliers in this respect. The Prison Service is resolutely committed to tackling drug abuse in a comprehensive way and has my full support. This involves a twin track approach of supply and demand reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of technical and policy measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling and use of illegal drugs in the prison system. These include sophisticated video surveillance, improved visiting and searching facilities, including facilities for strip searching prisoners, increased vigilance by staff and urine testing. Where visitors are found attempting to supply drugs to inmates, gardaí are called to the prison with a view to prosecuting the persons concerned. A number of prosecutions in this area take place every year and persons have served prison sentences in this respect. Efforts to eliminate the supply of drugs coming into our prisons are not enough on their own. The Prison Service will continue to seek to reduce demand for drugs within the prison system by the education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders. The action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system, which I <Col N="1243" /> approved in 1999, provides a detailed strategy to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. This includes the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of addiction counselling support services is central to the plan. The plan builds on a medical policy which has been agreed between my Department and the then Eastern Health Board in that it seeks to provide the same access to treatment for prisoners as patients have within the community.</P>
    <P>At my request the Director General of the Prisons Service established a national steering group for prison based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group comprises representatives from this Department, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, senior Prison Service management, probation and welfare service, prisons psychology service and the prison education service. The group submitted its first report to me in July 2000, and the report was circulated to various organisations for views and feedback. The implementation of the recommendations contained in the report were approved, in principle, by the Government on 18 October 2000, on the basis that the precise staffing and other expenditure related proposals would be the subject of direct negotiations between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Finance as well as the Prisons Service and health boards. I understand that the position of Co-ordinator of Drug Treatment Services (Prisons), identified in the steering group, has been advertised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and that discussions will begin in the near future with the Department of Finance with a view to filling the other posts proposed.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the introduction of methadone maintenance as a harm reduction strategy for drug addicts into the prison system has been a key development over the last year. All committals to Cloverhill Remand Prison who are involved in a drug maintenance programme in the community prior to committal are allowed continue their programmes while in custody there. This development was extended to Mountjoy Prison in October 2000, with all new committals and prisoners transferring from Cloverhill Remand Prison who were on approved treatment programmes continuing to receive this while in the prison. I am informed that there were 250 prisoners in receipt of methadone maintenance and a further 56 prisoners in receipt of detoxification on 27 March 2001. The number of prisoners currently on methadone maintenance has increased by 36% on the figures of 6 December 2000. These figures indicate both my own and the Prison Service's commitment to delivering a prison based drug treatment service which is equivalent to that available in the community. Methadone is a chemical substitute for heroin and even properly administered is not without some possible side <Col N="1244" /> effects. Taken to excess, or in conjunction with opiates, methadone consumption can have very harmful outcomes for abusers. These facts mean that dispersing methadone in our prisons is a very serious business requiring constant vigilance by medical and prison staff who use urine testing to ensure that prisoners on methadone maintenance or detox are not putting themselves at greater risk.</P>

      <P>A newspaper article, published on Sunday, 11 February 2001, alleged that members of the Garda Síochána and a civilian employee at Garda Headquarters had participated in trips abroad paid for by a company which supplies tyres to the Garda Síochána. On 13 February 2001, I advised the House that the Garda Commissioner had asked a Chief Superintendent to look into the allegations. I also advised the House that I was of the view that the matter warranted an external examination and that the Secretary General of my Department, in his capacity as Accounting Officer for the Garda vote, had instructed the internal audit unit of the Department to examine the matter. Since then further allegations have been made to the Garda and my Department and the matter is now the subject of a criminal investigation which has not been completed. I should also mention that when this issue first arose the Secretary General of my Department was in contact with the Comptroller and Auditor General and he was kept updated on developments. The Comptroller and Auditor General advised my Department on 12 March 2001 that he had directed his staff to commence an audit of the procurement of tyres for the Garda Síochána from both regularity and value-for-money viewpoints. The Public Offices Commission wrote to my Department on 13 February 2001 making certain inquiries related to this matter and the relevant available information sought from the Department has been forwarded to them. I understand that the Public Offices Commission also wrote to the Garda Commissioner about the matter.</P>

      <P>All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda District and Divisional Officers and receive their full support. Funding for Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and my Department. It has been the experience of the Garda authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera plus an additional amount towards civil works. This additional amount varies according to the availability of ducting etc. I <Col N="1246" /> announced last November that a total of £12 million was to be allocated towards the installation of CCTV systems nation-wide over the next three years as part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme, with £4 million being allocated in 2001. An application for a Garda CCTV system in Carlow is being considered in the context of this programme.</P>

      <P>Direct or indirect discrimination on the grounds of age, in relation to the supply of goods and the provision of services generally available to the public, is prohibited by the Equal Status Act, 2000. Under the Act, the age ground is defined as being applicable to a person who is over the age of 18 years, but there is no upper age threshold. The term service includes facilities for banking, insurance, grants, loans, credit or financing. As the Deputy may be aware, the Equal Status Act, 2000, is in full operation since October 2000. Section 5(2)(f2&gt;d) of the Act provides, in essence, that an insurance company which provides different treatment in relation to annuities, pensions, insurance policies or any other matter relating to the assessment of risk, which is effected by reference to reasonable actuarial or statistical data, will not be discriminating. The Act thus provides protection for individuals seeking insurance because a company will have to justify any different treatment by demonstrating that it is based on reasonably reliable data. </P>
      <P>The Equality Division of my Department does not have a role as such in relation to the matter mentioned in the Deputy's Question. Under the equality legislation, there are two independent bodies with statutory roles, the Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations. The Equality Authority, which has the role of working towards the elimination of discrimination, provides information and advice to any person who feels that he or she has been discriminated against on grounds of age and, or, on one of the other grounds in the equality legislation, whether in an employment area or not. Where a complaint of discrimination is made, the Director of Equality Investigations has the power under the Act to investigate and decide such a case. In the course of so doing, it will be open to the director to examine and make a finding as regards the reasonableness or otherwise of an insurance company's reliance, under section 5(2) (f2&gt;d), on the data on which the different treatment of that particular customer has been based.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Emmet Stagg, No. 51 on 1 March 2001, and in other recent replies, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, has been the subject of review from time to time. The most recent review, in 1998, was carried out in the context of an EU review of member states compliance with an EU joint action concerning action to combat racism and xenophobia. That joint action is now the subject of further review by the EU. To date, no changes in the law have resulted from these reviews. Nevertheless, some time ago I announced a further review of the legislation in my Department. While I cannot at this stage predict a timescale, I can say that I hope to conclude the review as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1997 Programme for Government included, in the context of measures to combat the drugs problem, the creation of a Drug Courts system which would involve court supervised treatment programmes for less serious drug related offences. Following the reports of the working group on a courts commission and an expert Drug Court planning committee, which I established, the pilot Drug Court programme was launched in the Dublin District Court on 9 January 2001 and the first sitting took place on 16 January. The court sits on Tuesday and Thursday, at 3 p.m. at the Richmond Courthouse, and each sitting is preceded by a meeting of the Drug Court team and the judge. I should mention that the Drug Court planning committee included representatives of a wide range of interests, including the community sector. Strict criteria must be satisfied before an offender may be admitted to the Drug Court programme. Specifically, the offender must be over 17 years of age, reside within the catchment area, Dublin's north inner city, for a minimum of one year, have pleaded guilty or been found guilty in court of a non-violent criminal offence, be liable to be sentenced if convicted, be dependent on the use of prohibited drugs and/or prescribed drugs, have a clear understanding of the implications of participation with the Drug Court, and be willing to co-operate with supervision, stop offending, avail of appropriate drug treatment and participate generally on the programme put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> It is a matter for the Judiciary as to whether an offender should be admitted into the Drug Court programme and acceptance does not mean that the participant can no longer be dealt with by the ordinary criminal courts. A participant may have his participation in the Drug Court programme terminated for non-compliance with the rules of the programme and in that event, the offender is referred back to the original court for the finalisation of his or her case. The Drug Court planning committee was established to develop an integrated cross service strategic plan involving court supervised treatment programmes on the basis of the re-allocation of resources, both budgetary and staffing, from other programmes, including programmes in the criminal justice system. I understand that, to date, 15 offenders have been referred to the Drug Court from the Dublin District Court. The pilot programme marks a major policy initiative in the criminal justice system and is designed as an alternative measure for dealing with less serious and non-violent drug offenders. The project is being evaluated by expert consultants who were appointed following a public procurement process. The merit of implementing a Drug Court programme on a national basis will be considered following the completion and evaluation of the pilot project in Dublin.</P>

In addition, I am informed that the notional costs for superannuation, accommodation and services provided by other Departments amounted to £4.3 million and that the total cost of pensions for existing staff amounts to £2.5 million. Prepayments of fees, in respect of applications lodged in the registries but not completed at the end of 2000 amounted to £9.7 million. I am further informed that, under Government accounting rules and taking account of notional costs, the registries had a surplus of £12.7 million during 2000. However, under accrual accounting rules the registries had a real surplus of £0.5 million. </P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, arising out of the current buoyancy in the economy, the intake of applications in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds continues to grow at an unprecedented level with each successive year setting new record levels. The total intake of new cases for the year 2000 amounted to 161,844. This represents an increase of 29,485 over the 1999 intake. In addition to the increase in property transactions, major infrastructural projects undertaken by the bodies responsible for systems and utilities such as Bord Gáis, ESB, Coillte, National Roads Authority and Bord na Móna have also placed considerable strain on the Registry's ability to provide essential services. In the circumstances, the staff in the Land Registry have worked very hard to give the best possible service to their customers. The Deputy will be aware that, in order to address this problem, I received sanction from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to increase the staffing complement of the Land Registry by 77. The resultant appointments are currently being made following a recruitment drive by the Civil Service Commission which is beginning to pay dividends. I can also assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the management and staff of the Land Registry to address the arrears situation which has developed over a period of time, mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the levels of business. The Land Registry management are implementing some proactive measures to help deal with the situation. These include improvements to workflow, the training and development of staff, the use of new technology, the launch of an e-commerce service and the computerised data capture of folios and maps. I am confident that, with the appointment of additional staff and the programme of measures being taken, the situation will improve.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a Refugee Legal Service information leaflet is prepared by the Refugee Legal Service and is issued to applicants by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. These <Col N="1253" /> documents are available in 24 languages, Albanian, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, English, Farsi, French, Hindi, Hungarian, Kurmanji/Turk, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Sorani/Iraqi, Spanish, Tamil, Thai, Turkish and Urdu. Notices are also posted in the office in a range of languages to assist applicants in accessing correct and relevant information. The Refugee Appeals Tribunal provides a procedure for appeal against a negative recommendation or determination of the Refugee Applications Commissioner who considers an application for a declaration as a refugee at first instance. </P>
    <P>An information leaflet setting out the applicant's rights under the appeals process is sent to the applicant with the recommendation or determination of the commissioner in a language that the applicant understands. Again, the information leaflets are available in 24 different languages. The Reception and Integration Agency, formerly the Directorate for Asylum Support Services, co-ordinates the system of direct provision and the resettlement of asylum seekers throughout the country. Under the arrangements currently in place asylum seekers are accommodated at initial reception centres in Dublin for a period of one to two weeks for the purposes, <i>inter alia</i>, of needs assessment, the provision of information and the processing of the initial stages of their asylum applications, before being resettled at other locations around the country. The information packs distributed to newly-arrived asylum seekers at reception centres are currently available in 21 languages &ndash; Albanian, Arabic, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, English, Farsi/Persian, French, Hindi, Hungarian, Kurmanji, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Tamil, Turkish, Kurdish Srani and Urdu. Before being resettled at accommodation centres around the country asylum seekers are provided with information about the centre and about the locality. This information is available in the nine main languages of asylum seekers in Ireland, Albanian, Arabic, Czech, English, French, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian and Russian. The need to make information leaflets available in additional languages is kept under ongoing review in the light of the number of nationalities in the asylum process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>The small claims procedure is a special mechanism for dealing with consumer claims, within the District Court structure, which is designed to handle such claims speedily, inexpensively and informally without involving a solicitor. It is administered by the Small Claims Registrar whose function it is to process the claims and, if possible, reach a satisfactory settlement without the need for a court hearing. Should this prove unsuccessful the claim will go before the District Court judge. The small claims procedure was initially introduced on a pilot basis in 1991 and was extended nation-wide in 1993 following on from the success of the pilot scheme. The current fee payable for using the procedure is £6 and the monetary limit which applies to claims made under the procedure is £1,000. In the event of the matter being referred to the sheriff a further fee of £6 applies, but this amount is refunded if the sheriff succeeds in executing the court order. This may be done in any case where a party does not comply with the court order. To avail of the procedure a consumer must have bought goods or services for private use from someone selling them in the course of business. Claims may be made for bad workmanship or faulty goods as far as most everyday transactions are concerned but not for debts or personal injuries. When the scheme was extended in 1993, the non-return of rent deposits and minor damage to privately-owned property were included.</P>
      <P>The operation of the small claims procedure, which is essentially consumer focused, was reviewed in 1999 and such issues as the monetary limit which applies and the scope of the procedure were examined. Following the review, I increased the monetary limit which applies to claims made under the procedure from £600 to £1,000. The review committee considered that the broadening of the procedure to include small businesses would represent a significant expansion of the procedure and one which the Courts Service should examine following its establishment. The Courts Service has indicated effecting the kind of change suggested by the Deputies would be likely to change the whole nature of the small claims procedure and would probably have the effect of reducing the current level of service to consumers.</P>

      <P>Garda CCTV systems have been installed in Dublin's city centre, north central and south central, and in Tralee. The combined cost of these CCTV systems exceeded £1.8 million. The installation of a CCTV system in Cork city, consisting of 29 cameras, is currently being undertaken and its final cost is likely to be in excess of £800,000. I announced last November <Col N="1256" /> that a total of £12 million was to be allocated to the installation of CCTV systems nation-wide over the next three years as part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme with £4 million being allocated in 2001. As part of the first tranche of the expansion programme Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. At least six further areas will commence in 2003, to be announced in due course. It is anticipated that these ten CCTV systems will be installed in the period 2001 to 2002. While these Garda systems will be funded by my Department, co-funding will also be a feature, to be addressed when detailed costings are available and before work on the installation of the CCTV systems commences.</P>
      <P>I am, however, also conscious that some applications for CCTV systems that have been received by the advisory committee, established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV Systems, relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. I have given careful consideration to how assistance can be provided to areas which are not rated as a high level Garda priority. To this end, I plan to soon introduce a grant scheme to cater for those communities who would like to press ahead, on their own, with a local CCTV system. It will be up to local interests to install and monitor the CCTV schemes though grant assistance will be provided. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the Garda will have to be allowed access to the system as and when they require. Local authorities will have an important role to play. The details of this new scheme are being finalised and full details, including relevant conditions and grant levels, will be announced soon.</P>

    <P>I can inform the Deputy that I have provided the Legal Aid Board with a budget of £7.9 million <Col N="1257" /> in 2001 for the Refugee Legal Service.

    <P>I am informed that the Refugee Legal Service was unable to provide a full range of services for a short period recently.

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 March 2000 the Government agreed with my recommendations for the establishment of a statutory agency, under the aegis of my Department, called the Reception and Integration Agency. It replaces the Directorate for Asylum Support Services and, with effect from 2 April last, incorporates the Refugee Agency. Pending the enactment of legislation the new agency is operating on a non-statutory basis. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to establish the Reception and Integration Agency follows an earlier decision of the Government that the recommendations in the report of the interdepartmental working group on the integration of refugees in Ireland should form the framework for integration policy and be implemented. The establishment of a single organisational structure &ndash; within the overall framework of structures for asylum and immigration &ndash; for co-ordinating and implementing integration policy is one of the key recommendations of the working group. The Reception and Integration Agency is the vehicle for implementing this recommendation and its establishment facilitates a cohesive, co-ordinated <Col N="1258" /> approach to both the reception of asylum seekers and the integration of refugees.</P>
    <P>The agency has responsibility for: planning and co-ordinating the provision of services to both asylum seekers and refugees; co-ordinating and implementing integration policy for all refugees and persons who, though not refugees, are granted leave to remain; and responding to conflict crisis situations which result in relatively large numbers of refugees arriving in Ireland within a short period of time, for example, the Kosovar nationals who were invited here by the Government in 1999.</P>
    <P>The agency like its predecessor &ndash; the Directorate for Asylum Support Services &ndash; will continue to function on a cross agency/departmental, multi-disciplinary basis. In that regard, in addition to my own Department, staff assigned to it are drawn from the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Dublin Corporation, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Defence Forces and the Irish Red Cross.</P>
    <P>I have also recently appointed an interim advisory board to the new agency. This board is chaired by Mr. Raymond Rooney and has 15 members made up of seven members of the wider community and one representative each of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Foreign Affairs, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children, Environment and Local Government and Finance as well as the Director of the Reception and Integration Agency on an<i> ex-officio</i> basis.</P>
    <P>While it would be premature at this stage to set out in precise terms the nature or content of the legislation to be put in place in respect of the agency, I can confirm that my thinking is that it would be along similar lines to that which underpins other agencies and services in the wider Justice, Equality and Law Reform area. Moreover, I believe that the interim advisory board should also be afforded an opportunity to consider and to bring forward its views on this matter in advance of any decision on it by the Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 173 together.</P>
      <P>Section 19 of the Refugee Act, 1996, provides the legislative basis for ensuring that the identity of an applicant is kept confidential by all involved in the application process. This is an essential safeguard for the protection not only of applicants themselves, but also of their relatives and connections left behind in the country where persecution may have arisen.</P>
      <P>In that regard, section 19(1) of the Refugee Act, 1996 places an onus on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and their officers to take all practicable steps to keep confidential the identity of applicants for refugee status.</P>
      <P>Section 19(2) of the Act provides that nothing likely to lead members of the public to identify a person as an applicant for refugee status under the Act is published or broadcast without the consent of the person and the consent of the Minister, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The provision is intended to safeguard the identity of applicants for refugee status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am satisfied that the prohibition on the publication or broadcast of such material, without the applicant's consent, is justified in the interests <Col N="1261" /> of the protection of the asylum seeker, I have already indicated that, in line with practice in other EU member states, I propose to take advantage of the next suitable legislative opportunity to bring forward an amendment of section 19(2) solely to remove the requirement of the Minister's consent.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I should point out that the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations is an independent statutory office set up under the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and that the director and her equality officers and equality mediation officers are independent in the performance of their functions.</P>
      <P>The mediation service of the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations has been operational since early this year. I have been advised by the director that, so far, ten cases have been referred for mediation.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the equality legislation, mediation is: voluntary &ndash; both parties must consent to participate. Either party may withdraw that consent at any time and the mediation will be terminated; confidential &ndash; mediation sessions are held in private and mediated settlements are not published; and binding &ndash; if agreement is reached it can be enforced through the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the director, in drawing up guidelines and a code of ethics to govern mediation, has fully respected these principles. Copies of explanatory material on mediation <Col N="1262" /> which have been produced by her office are available on their web site at: www.odei.ie.</P>
    <P>I should add that, when the legislation was being drawn up, mediation was intended to provide a cost-effective alternative to formal investigations and to provide a mechanism for resolving disputes with less conflict. I would consequently urge interested parties to make optimum use of this service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Reception and Integration Agency, which has been established following a decision of the Government in March last year. Pending the enactment of legislation, the Reception and Integration Agency &ndash; which has replaced the Directorate for Asylum Support Services and, with effect from 2 April last, incorporated the Refugee Agency &ndash; will operate on a non-statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The decision to establish the Reception and Integration Agency follows an earlier decision of the Government that the recommendations in the report of the interdepartmental working group on the integration of refugees in Ireland should form the framework for integration policy and be implemented. The establishment of a single organisational structure &ndash; within the overall framework of structures for asylum and immigration &ndash; for co-ordinating and implementing integration policy is one of the key recommendations of the working group. The Reception and Integration Agency is the vehicle for implementing this recommendation and its establishment facilitates a cohesive, co-ordinated approach to both the reception of asylum seekers and the integration of refugees. Until recently, both the Directorate for Asylum Support Services and the Refugee Agency, which operated under the aegis of my own Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs, respectively, had functions in relation to the integration of different categories of refugees. The new arrangements have rationalised previous structures and represent a more effective use of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Reception and Integration Agency has responsibility for: planning and co-ordinating the provision of services to both asylum seekers and refugees; co-ordinating and implementing integration policy for all refugees and persons who, though not refugees, are granted leave to remain; and responding to conflict crisis situations which result in relatively large numbers of refugees arriving in Ireland within a short period of time, <Col N="1263" /> for example, the Kosovar nationals who were invited here by the Government in 1999.</P>
    <P>The agency, like its predecessor &ndash; the Directorate for Asylum Support Services &ndash; functions as a cross agency/departmental, multi-disciplinary team. In that regard, in addition to my own Department, staff assigned to it are drawn from the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Dublin Corporation, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Defence Forces and the Irish Red Cross. This structure greatly facilitates the co-ordination of services across a wide spectrum of activity from accommodation to health and welfare services to education to support structures in local communities.</P>
    <P>Under the system of direct provision administered by the Reception and Integration Agency and introduced for asylum seekers arriving on or after 10 April 2000 approximately, 9,000 asylum seekers have been dispersed, up to 6 April 2001, to 65 accommodation centres in 23 counties.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the recent value-for-money study carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General. At the outset, I should state that my Department welcomes the study which will be of valuable assistance to it and all the other agencies involved in the collection of fines, including the Courts Service and, of course, the Garda Síochána in improving the system.</P>
      <P>The report found that the collections of fines was a very complex process which involved interaction and interdependence between many separate units in a range of agencies under different managements. As the Deputy may be aware chapter six of the report entitled &ldquo;The Department's View&rdquo; sets out my Department's views on how the system can move forward and mentions specific projects which are already under way to bring this about.</P>
      <P>Although my Department has no direct role in the collection of fines the two agencies mainly responsible i.e. the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service come under the aegis of my Department. A high level group comprising representatives of the Department, the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service is being put in place to address the issues highlighted in the C &amp; AG's report.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that I have recently received final reports from the Director General of the Prisons Service and the Governor of Arbour Hill Prison. The findings of both reports are currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated in the House, the prison authorities informed the Garda of the escape at the earliest possible opportunity. In addition all relevant information in relation to the prisoner, i.e., a recent photograph, last known address, next of kin, name of victim, etc. was also passed to the Garda.</P>
      <P>Whenever an escape occurs, an appropriate response is put in place by the Garda Síochána. It is, as I have indicated in the House before, an operational matter for the Garda Authorities to consider whether the public is considered to be at risk and what is the best strategy to pursue in returning the prisoner to custody.</P>
      <P>Following a number of escapes earlier this year the Director General of the Prisons Service set up an expert review group to examine the circumstances of each escape and to review escorting procedures and the equipment used in such escorts. The areas examined include transport arrangements, staff training, the profiling of prisoners, searching procedures, the use of handcuffs and batons and the situation in relation to keyholders. This group, whose members include the head of operations in the Irish Prison Service and two senior prison governors, have now reported to the Director General and new guidelines will shortly issue to all prison governors. The review group is of the view that escort procedures, including the elements of equipment in use, techniques for equipment use, searching procedures and training provided, taken together and correctly applied, will allow prison officers achieve optimum levels of security on escorts. Some refinements in these elements have been identified which will further enhance escort security and recommendations have been made in this regard which will be implemented immediately. In view of the obvious security implications, I am not in a position to comment in any detail on these enhancements. The review group will continue to examine other issues which require longer term actions which may involve other agencies, including the Courts Service and the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>In 1999, a book entitled <i>Bandit Country &ndash; The IRA and South Armagh</i> was published which contained an allegation that the murder of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan of the RUC on 20 March 1989 was facilitated by the passing of information on the policemen's movements by a member of the Garda Síochána to the Provisional IRA.</P>
      <P>On 10 March 2000, Mr. Kevin Myers wrote an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which he alleged that Garda collusion with the Provisional IRA had, in addition to the murders of Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan, facilitated ten other murders, namely, those of Tracy Doak, Steven Rodgers, David Baird and William Wilson, all RUC officers, at Killeen, County Armagh on 20 May 1985; Lord and Lady Gibson at Killeen, County Armagh on 25 April 1987; Robert, Maureen and David Hanna at Killeen, County Armagh on 23 July 1988; and Tom Oliver, following his kidnapping at Riverstown, Dundalk, County Louth on 19 July 1991. These additional allegations were also included in a revised edition of <i>Bandit Country &ndash; The IRA and South Armagh,</i> which was issued in 2000.</P>
      <P>On 11 April 2000, the Garda Commissioner directed Detective Chief Superintendent Seán Camon, National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, with Detective Inspector Peter Kirwan, security and intelligence branch, to re-examine all available files and investigate these allegations. I informed the Dáil of this investigation in an answer to a parliamentary question on 13 April 2000.</P>
      <P>As part of the investigation, the investigating officers carried out inquiries in this jurisdiction, Northern Ireland and the United States. All available relevant correspondence was also examined. The authors of the book and <i>The Irish Times</i> article, as well as other persons relevant to the investigation, were interviewed. The investigating officers did everything that could be expected in order to ascertain whether evidence exists to support the allegations made.</P>

    <P>The report of the investigating officers was submitted to me on 20 February 2001. While I do not intend to publish the report because of its confidential nature, the investigating officers have stated that they found no evidence of collusion between members of the Garda Síochána and subversives in these murders. In addition, they were informed by the RUC, which also carried <Col N="1266" /> out an investigation into the allegations, that no evidence existed, nor could any documentation be located, which evidences any such Garda collusion with subversives.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 61 and 152 of 7 February 2001 and No. 88 of 15 November 2000 which dealt with the issue of the entitlement of asylum seekers to enter into paid employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> The Government, as an exceptional measure, agreed on 26 July 1999 that those asylum seekers who had been in this country for more than 12 months, who were still awaiting a final determination of their application for refugee status and who had been compliant with their obligations as asylum seekers should be given the right to seek work. The arrangement applied to those who sought asylum here up to 26 July 1999, as soon as they crossed the 12 months threshold.</P>
    <P>In December 1999, the Government decided to remove the requirement that an employer must obtain a work permit before employing asylum seekers covered by the 26 July 1999 Government decision. The Government also decided that each eligible asylum seeker should be issued with a letter confirming entitlement to work for presentation to potential employers and my Department arranged accordingly. To date, over 2,650 such letters have issued. As I previously informed the House, it is not proposed to allow asylum applicants who are not covered by the aforementioned July 1999 decision to take up paid employment pending a final decision being made on their applications.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that the number of asylum seekers who have been here for more than six months and who are still awaiting a first stage decision is 8,792. I have also been informed by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal that there were 2,503 appeal cases in hand at 31 March 2001. Approximately 2,300 of these appeals relate to applicants who made first stage applications for refugee status more than six months ago.</P>
    <P>On 5 July 2000 the Government announced approval for the immediate recruitment of 370 additional staff for asylum case processing and appeals and to deal with consequential repatriations with the possibility of more staff being made available in the future. This will allow a number of strategic objectives to be achieved, namely, greatly increasing processing capacity, including appeals, to deliver more speedy decisions in relation to applications for refugee status leading, in due course, to the completion to finality of the processing of all new asylum applications within a six month period which will ensure that those who qualify clearly as refugees will receive decisions on their applications much more speedily and that applications where there is clearly no basis for qualification will also be dealt with on a faster basis; the elimination of the asylum applications currently in hand as soon as possible; and dealing with the increased numbers of repatriations which are expected to arise in respect of persons whose applications for refugee status are refused.</P>
    <P>The recruitment process for these additional staff is almost complete. A total of 130 of the 370 posts are to be filled in an atypical fashion, that is, a special competition organised by my Department. Interviews for these posts, at clerical officer <Col N="1268" /> and executive officer level, have recently taken place and successful candidates will be offered the positions in the next few weeks. Additional accommodation is also in the process of being sourced.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that no seizures of cocaine base, crack, have been made this year, to date. Four seizures containing cocaine base, crack, with a combined weight of 72.6 grammes were made during 2000. All of these seizures occurred in the Dublin metropolitan region. A special Garda operation is in place to investigate the availability of crack cocaine and a particular group is being targeted in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have assured me that the Garda continuously monitors and analyses the trends and patterns in illicit drug use and have informed me that there is no evidence to suggest a growing presence of crack cocaine in Dublin or elsewhere in the country. The Garda is fully aware from foreign experience of the addictive and behaviour changing nature of crack cocaine and in this context, the incidence of cocaine base usage will be kept under review, with the utmost importance being attached to investigations in this area.</P>

      <P>The drinks prices order was only one element of an overall package of measures approved by the Government last June to address the inflationary pressures on the economy. When announcing the anti-inflationary package, the Government made it clear that it was only pending the impact of a significant increase in competition in the licensed trade that the circumstances justified the imposition of temporary price controls. The statutory control on the price of drink was clearly understood to be an interim measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is acknowledged that many publicans have acted in a reasonable manner following the expiry of the drinks order. It is also clear that some publicans took the opportunity of the lifting of the order to impose excessive price increases. The <Col N="1269" /> indications are that the proportion of pubs increasing their prices and the level of increases being imposed are higher in Dublin that the rest of the country. Price freezing legislation has long been recognised as a blunt instrument. Competition provides the most effective means of keeping prices down. This holds true for the licensed trade just as much as for any other sector of the economy. All of these factors are being taken into account in the consideration of whether a new drinks prices order should be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 to 76, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Health and Safety Authority, which comes under the auspices of my Department, is the central competent authority for the Seveso II directive. The authority has advised me that the Seveso II directive introduced a requirement, not present in the Seveso I directive, that all member states should ensure that the objectives of preventing major accidents, and limiting the consequences of such, are taken into account in their land use policies and-or other relevant policies through controls on establishments covered by the directive or a development in the vicinity of such an establishment.</P>
      <P>Regulations entitled European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 476 of 2000), which are necessary to implement the provisions of the directive, became law in December last year. The Health and Safety Authority's role is purely advisory and it is for the planning authority concerned to take the final decision in the development of an area within its jurisdiction following consideration by it of all material relevant to each application. The authority is independent in the carrying out of its functions in this area and I have no direct role in the matter. Detailed information regarding establishments in Ireland which come under the Seveso directive, and the amounts and nature of dangerous substances involved at each location, is information which is held by the authority. The Deputy may contact the authority directly for any specific information in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority, which developed the proposals for regulations for the transposition of the directive in question, has informed me that it consulted with its Dangerous Substances Advisory Committee, established under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989. The advisory committee comprises representatives from the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Environment and Local Government and Public Enterprise, the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Road Haulage Association, the Consumers' Association of Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the National Irish Safety Organisation, the Irish Pharmaceutical and Chemical Manufacturers' Federation, the Environmental Protection Agency, An Taisce, the Royal Irish Academy, the Irish Liquified Petroleum Gas Association and the Irish Petroleum Industry Association. During the drafting process <Col N="1271" /> of the regulations, separate consultations also took place with the various Departments centrally involved, namely, the Departments of the Environment and Local Government, Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Marine and Natural Resources as well as my own Department. Given the extensive nature of the consultation process, a range of issues of interest to the different parties would have been raised from time to time on different aspects of the directive. The draft text of the regulations was approved by the Dangerous Substances Advisory Committee and the board of the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>My Department has received a number of representations since the Seveso II directive became applicable in Irish law. Representations have been received from public representatives on behalf of developers and others in the Passage West area of County Cork. Representations were also received from other interested parties in connection with the delay in, and other aspects of, the transposition of the directive.</P>
    <P>The articles of the directive, for which my Department has responsibility through the Health and Safety Authority, have been implemented into Irish law under the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2000. The authority, as the central competent authority, is obliged, when requested to do so by the relevant planning authorities, to give technical advice in relation to planning applications relating to sites covered by the directive or a development in the vicinity of such a site. Provisions relating to the land use planning aspects of the directive are contained in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, enacted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I understand that supplementary regulations to underpin those aspects of the directive are being finalised by his Department.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Health and Safety Authority that implementation of the regulations made under the Seveso II directive is at an early stage. Notifications are now being assessed and in respect of &ldquo;Top Tier&rdquo; establishments, the authority is in the process of contacting those who have been or are due to be appointed as local competent authorities for the purposes of establishing off-site emergency plans. The authority is also in the process of contacting planning authorities in respect of the notifications received so as to enable the provision of technical advice in respect of developments at, or in the vicinity of, establishments subject to the regulations. In this regard there is also an obligation on establishments to contact the planning authorities.</P>
    <P>The authority has informed me that it has also provided generic land use planning advice for Cork County Council for the Passage West area and for Mayo County Council in respect of the gas receiving station for the Corrib gas field.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> The staffing of the authority in the specific area dealing with this issue was increased by seven in 2000 and a further two are being recruited. The particular area of the authority which deals with the Seveso directive has other responsibilities and the recent personnel recruited by the authority also perform other inspectorate duties.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has had discussions with the Director of Legal Metrology concerning expressions of interest from a company, which is principally engaged in the calibration of flow meters, in expanding its activities to include the testing and verification of such instruments. Calibration is concerned with the maintenance-repair of measurement systems by determining accuracy and carrying out the necessary adjustments and repairs. Milk collection systems and oil distribution systems are calibrated either by their owners or private sector companies.</P>
      <P>Verification attests that the instrument is within specified legal tolerances after calibration has taken place. The testing and verification of measuring instruments for trade use is a function controlled under the Legal Metrology Act, 1996. While presently all functions under the Metrology Act are exclusively carried out by the Legal Metrology Service, provision have been included in the legislation which allows for the authorisation of other bodies, when warranted, to undertake specific functions under the Act. Any decision to authorise private companies to undertake prescribed functions under the Act could only be taken following an independent impact analysis of how these services are to be most efficiently and effectively carried out.</P>
      <P>The Director of Legal Metrology has informed me that he is satisfied that the verification and inspection of flow meters is carried out in line with international practices. The director has also indicated that the feasibility of commissioning an impact analysis into the authorisation of private companies to undertake prescribed functions under the Act in a number of areas will be examined in the context of developing the future strategy for the Legal Metrology Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, provides that goods should be of merchantable quality, fit for the purpose for which they are intended and as described. The provider of <Col N="1274" /> services should have the skills necessary to do the service and it should be carried out with due care and diligence and any materials should be of merchantable quality, fit for the purpose intended and as described. This is an area of civil law and if goods or services purchased do not meet these criteria, the consumer is normally entitled to a repair, replacement or refund, whichever is agreed between the supplier and the consumer to be most appropriate.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that as proof of purchase is generally required in the event of a dispute, it is the practice of most retailers and service providers to provide receipts. Where this is not the case it is open to a consumer to request a receipt, and if told that this will not be available to take their custom elsewhere. However, receipts are not the only proof of purchase, for example, a cheque stub is one such proof. The buyer, however, should be advised at all times to follow the old adage <i>caveat emptor</i>&ndash; let the buyer beware. They should check in advance that they have a contact number to deal with aftercare if and when the need arises. While the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act sets out legal obligations and implied terms in every contract and this gives the buyer protection in law, there is an onus on buyers to check out in advance where contractors operate from and where they can be contacted after the event. This applies particularly if contractors move around a lot or even operate from a base abroad.</P>
      <P>Neither my Department nor the Director of Consumer Affairs is aware of any significant level of difficulties being experienced by consumers in this area and from a practical point of view I do not see what purpose there would be in introducing a legal obligation of the type suggested by the Deputy.</P>

    <P>The significant increase in 2001, 27%, follows the Government decision in September 2000 that committed Ireland to achieving the UN target for ODA of 0.7% of GNP by 2007. An interim target of 0.45% of GNP will be achieved in 2002.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decided last September that it would move progressively year on year to meet by 2007 the United Nations target for assistance to poorer countries of 0.7% of gross national product, GNP. In addition, it agreed to reach an interim target of 0.45% of GNP in 2002. Allocations to allow the Irish programme to reach the interim target have already been agreed with the Minister for Finance. As part of the decision on the target, the Government instructed that a review should be carried out with the view of outlining a renewed policy base for the programme. That review, led by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, is under way and a report is expected in a few months.</P>

      <P>At the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 4 April 2001, the Swedish Presidency announced it would be seeking an agreement at the next Council, due to be held in June, on the next phase of liberalisation of the postal services market. To this end, the Presidency announced that it will be working to develop a compromise text which it hopes could form the basis of an agreement at the Transport-Telecommunications Council in June this year. There was discussion on this item. At the Council meeting on 22 December last, I spoke in favour of a staged approach to liberalisation consistent with the position put forward by the European Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications infrastructure and services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly those in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, £21 million was made available to support the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure to the regions. This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to £147 million. This funding will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced telecommunications infrastructure and services in the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first call for proposals under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, closed on 22 September 2000. Applications for funding under this call were assessed and evaluated at arms length by independent consultants. In January, I announced nine projects that are now going ahead and will receive a total of £44.6 million in national development plan aid. Two of these pro<Col N="1277" /> jects involve the deployment of broadband services along the Border region.</P>
    <P>The Border midlands west broadband corridor being built by Chorus involves the construction of two broadband corridors. The first of these links Castlebar to Buncrana, via Ballina, Sligo, Donegal and Letterkenny, and the second links Athlone to Monaghan, via Mullingar and Cavan. Other upgrades will be made to communications infrastructure in Galway, Ballinasloe, Tullamore, Longford, Sligo and Dublin. The cost of the Chorus Border midlands west broadband corridor will amount to £14 million and the NDP aid awarded to this project will be £4.6 million. The project is due to be completed by 31 December 2002.</P>
    <P>The second project is being built by ESB International. This project involves the deployment of up to 1,107 kilometres of fibre optic cable to 17 locations around the country by means of a fibre wrap on the existing electricity network. The infrastructure will provide for services in both Cavan and Monaghan. The cost of the ESBI project will amount to £38.8 million and the NDP aid awarded to this project is £13.1 million. The project is due to be completed by 31 December 2002. My Department is now reviewing future infrastructure investment needs in the light of the results of this first call for proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>Hill sheep farmers in the six western counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry who use commonage were required to destock by 30% in compliance with the conditions of the interim national commonage framework plan. The interim national commonage framework plan was implemented in advance of the preparation of framework plans that will set the actual stocking rates to apply on individual commonages. Work on preparation of these framework plans is now at an advanced stage. When these plans are available, farmers may opt either to participate in REPS and avail of the relevant payments, in which case the stocking requirements set out in the commonage framework plan will be integrated into the REPS plan, or to opt for compensation under a national scheme to be implemented by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. I understand the European Commission is considering proposals for this scheme at present.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to recall the context in which limits on stock levels had to be set. High stocking levels had caused ecological damage to upland areas and the problem was especially acute on commonage land. This situation threatened the continued availability of EU aid on all commonage land. An agreement negotiated with the European Commission in 1998 led to the revision of the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme to include a new supplementary measure A, in the new REP scheme this is known as measure A. Substantial payment rates of up to £77 per acre were approved under this measure on the basis that more stringent farming conditions would apply on target area land, including commonage, with stock reduction a key requirement for payment of aid. This agreement was negotiated in consultation with the farming organisations. The individual framework plans will take full account of the state of each commonage in establishing the level of destocking required to enable satisfactory recovery of vegetation.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to introduce a comprehensive national identification system for sheep, involving the individual identification of all sheep by tagging, from next May and my Department is currently working towards this objective. In the course of advancing this work, discussions on the details of the system have been held with the various relevant representative organisations.</P>
      <P>Under the system, sheep will be tagged and details of all sheep on farms and of all sheep movements will be fully recorded. Processors will be required to link the individual sheep tag number to the number of the finished carcass. Ireland will thus, for the first time, have full traceability for all sheep on an individual animal basis. This will be of significant benefit, most notably in terms of disease control, marketing and in the implementation of the relevant recommendations of the sheepmeat forum which reported in October 1999. In designing the new system, my Department has also taken full account of current and prospective requirements at EU level in relation to sheep identification.</P>
      <P>I have consistently stated that I attach great importance to ensuring that this particular project is completed by May. Deficiencies in this area are no longer acceptable and I expect the co-operation of all concerned in ensuring that the full traceability system, based on tagging and encompassing producers, marts, processors and others, can be put in place within this timescale.</P>

      <P>Agriculture is one of the six areas identified for co-operation under the Good Friday Agreement. With the aim of achieving enhanced co-operation, the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, has met in its agriculture sectoral format on three occasions to date. The following issues of mutual interest were discussed at those meetings: co-operation on animal health policy-operations, animal and plant health research and development, joint study of the pig <Col N="1281" /> industry, cross-Border rural development; less favoured area, LFA, payments, World Trade Organisation and the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>The issue taking priority over all others at present, both North and South, is the control of foot and mouth disease. In that regard, at the most recent agriculture meeting of the NSMC, I met with Minister Rodgers to review the situation in relation to this issue. It was decided that officials of the two Departments would develop a strategy for the control of animal movements on the island of Ireland, drawing on work done in both jurisdictions and, in the light of experience gained from the current foot and mouth disease outbreaks, consider the means of prevention, containment and eradication of future epizootic disease outbreaks on the island.</P>
      <P>As regards the food industry, the &ldquo;Ireland &ndash; The Food Island&rdquo; logo was introduced by Bord Bia in 1995. It was designed to develop the concept of there being an underlying unity of values in the Irish food industry and is part of Bord Bia's marketing communications strategy. It is used as an overall branding device to promote the capability and values of the Irish food and drink industry and to differentiate Ireland and its food and drink products in the marketplace. As was the case in 2000, Bord Bia is coming together with IDB, Industrial Development Board, and LEDU, Local Enterprise Development Unit, in Northern Ireland to run a market development programme for Irish food in 2001. The North-South activities taking place this year are a US market visit in June with 20 companies involved; a joint North-South stand at the New York Fancy Food Fair in July; and ongoing exchange of market information between IDB and Bord Bia.</P>
      <P>The value of enhanced co-operation in relation to the agriculture and food sectors to both parts of the island of Ireland is widely recognised. I intend to further develop these links at every opportunity and especially through the forthcoming meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the Adjournment debate on 29 March in relation to the report in question. In summary, my position is that the study singularly failed to take into account the incidence of BSE in this country and the range of strict controls in place at farm level, at processing level and in feed manufacture. The compilation of the data for the UK report took place without reference to my Department. The range of measures put in place in Ireland ensures that consumers of Irish beef are not subject to unacceptable levels of risk. This has been confirmed by both the EU and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland based on detailed examinations of the systems in place. The EU Scientific Steering Committee classified Ireland as a low incidence country and has deemed the Irish control regime to be &ldquo;optimally stable&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The increases and any arrears owing to retired senior civil servants under the 38th Report of the Review on Higher Remuneration (Buckley) should be paid by end-May 2001. The increases, which were approved for payment on 28 February 2001, are payable with effect from 25 September 2000 and 1 March 2001. In addition, the 1 October 2000 increase under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will have to be revised and the 2% increase under the same agreement from 1 April 2001 has also to be paid.</P>
      <P>Under normal circumstances these increases would have been calculated by the computerised pension system. However, because the exercise involved a complex interaction of calculations arising from both the review body and PPF increases, a considerable amount of reprogramming would have been required in order to implement the increases in the normal way.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there are several other IT initiatives currently ongoing, that is, a changeover of computer payroll systems, preparation for the euro and the introduction of the tax credit system, and considering the number of pensioners involved &ndash; 400 approximately &ndash; it was decided that calculation of the increases manually was a more practical and productive use of resources on this occasion. I would wish to make it clear to the Deputy that this decision was made because of the unusual level of pressure on our IT personnel at present and not because of a shortage of computers.</P>

      <P>The new peace operational programme, which will cover the period to the end of 2004, will be implemented in the Border region by a range of locally based delivery agents. Projects submitted for funding under the new programme will be subject to assessment by these agencies by reference to criteria agreed by the programme monitoring committee. Neither I nor my Department will have direct involvement in the selection of projects. It is not possible to say if a project will be funded under the new programme until it has been fully assessed by the relevant agencies.</P>
      <P>Pending introduction of the new programme, I announced arrangements to secure the continued operation of groups which support employment in the Border counties. A fund of £2 million has been provided to meet demands from groups and I understand that this has met all current requirements. The project referred to by the Deputy has received a grant of £10,000 towards the costs of employing a project co-ordinator/manager for six months commencing January 2001. It is envisaged that funding will continue to be provided in this way until the new programme becomes operational. I would suggest that the project promoters pursue the issue of further funding with Area Development Management Limited and the Combat Poverty Agency who are jointly responsible for management of the interim funding initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The peace operational programme was approved by the European Commission on 22 March. The next phase of the programme's development involves the setting out of a range of implementation issues, including the method for delivery of funds, detailed measure descriptions, and project selection criteria. This phase of development is at an advanced stage and must be completed by late June 2001. My expectation is that elements of the peace programme will be launched in early summer and that those projects currently receiving interim funding will be able <Col N="1288" /> to apply under the new programme around that time.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person and her husband have elected to be assessed for income tax on the basis of single assessment. Accordingly, maintenance payments which the person receives is reckonable income for the purposes of social insurance and, consequently, PRSI is payable at the Class S rate, in the circumstances involved. It is in the interests of the person involved to continue to make PRSI contributions as this may entitle her to an old age contributory pension and widow's contributory pension, in her own right, in due course.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer is in receipt of maintenance payments of £700 per month for her own benefit. She is taxable under the self-assessment system in respect of this income. The taxpayer is in receipt of all of the income tax allowances and reliefs to which she is entitled. In the 1999-2000 tax year she had no income tax liability but her PRSI liability was £368, that is, income of £8,400, less PRSI exemption of £1,040, at the rate of 5%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Insurance Act, 1994, and the Health Insurance Regulations, 1996, provide the regulatory framework for the operation of a competitive private health insurance market in Ireland. The legislation requires all insurers offering health insurance to comply with the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.</P>
      <P>The Health Insurance Act, 1994 (Minimum Benefit) Regulations, 1996, require health insurers to provide a minimum level of cover under each policy. In specifying minimum levels of cover which insurers are obliged to provide, the regulatory arrangements leave scope for commercial negotiation between insurers and private service providers. In addition, these regulations also recognise that insurers should be in a position to determine which service providers are to supply services to members on their behalf.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, in addition to the generally applicable health insurance regulatory framework, section 2 of the VHI (Amendment) Act, 1996, sets out the statutory position concerning the making of arrangements between VHI and service providers. This gives the board explicit powers in relation to entering into, or refusing to enter into, agreements with health service providers for the treatment and care of its members. The Minister has no function in this area under the Act.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the chairperson of the board expressed concern at a recent board meeting about the financial situation involving specific items including its new IT system and the additional costs of measures being implemented by the board to further reduce the possible risk of transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion. I have assured the board of my commitment to ensure that it is adequately resourced to introduce necessary new measures to further improve blood safety. The IBTS will discuss the costs of these measures with my Department which includes additional donor recruitment programmes which are necessary arising from the decision to defer donors who resided in the UK for a cumulative period of five years. In relation to the IT programme, my Department is finalising discussions with the IBTS concerning additional investment in this state of the art system which I understand will be operational in a matter of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> In addition, there will also be financial implications for the IBTS arising from the application of strategies which reduce or eliminate the use of blood components as part of the management of patients requiring surgery in line with the recently issued Guideline for Transfusion of Red Blood Cells in Surgical Patients. The board is fully aware of the necessity to ensure efficiencies in the provision of services which are funded by hospitals which purchase blood and blood products.</P>

      <P>I am most concerned and disappointed at the ongoing disagreement between the three children's hospitals in Dublin concerning the location of certain specialities and the structure of consultant paediatric surgery posts. The failure of the three hospitals to agree on the structuring of a post, as recommended by Comhairle na nOspideál, has prevented the permanent filling of the post referred to by Deputy Allen.</P>
      <P>I am firmly of the view that it should be possible to resolve this matter through some minor modifications of the recommendations of Comhairle na nOspideál as to the structure and sessional commitments attaching to the specialist paediatric surgery posts in the three hospitals. My Department is now requesting the Eastern Regional Health Authority to progress the matter urgently on that basis and I am hopeful that this may lead to a resolution of the current disagreement.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Insurance Act, 1994, and the 1996 Health Insurance Regulations provide for &ldquo;open enrolment&rdquo;. This obliges insurers to make cover available to persons under the age of 65 regardless of whether or not they were previously covered. It also requires that persons transferring between insurers, or persons whose previous cover had not lapsed for a material period, be provided with cover. The law also provides for &ldquo;lifetime cover&rdquo; which means that once a person is covered by a registered insurer, he or she cannot be deprived of cover except in limited exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>The citing of the age of 65 years, under which insurers are obliged to provide cover in the State to persons requesting it, reflects the practice prevailing in the market prior to the introduction of the 1994 Act. Under the current regulatory arrangements, it is a matter for registered insurers to decide whether or not to provide cover for a person of or over the age of 65 years who is seeking access to the community rated health insurance system for the first time or after a material period has elapsed since previously covered. However, if an insurer decides to make such cover available, it must do so on the basis of community rating and lifetime cover. The VHI and BUPA are the two insurers who provide cover to the general public. I am not aware that either of these make cover available to people aged 65 or over other than on a renewal basis or where the individuals concerned are transferring between insurers.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Private Health Insurance addresses the question of enabling those aged 65 or over avail of private health insurance based on lifetime community rating. Legislation to give effect to such an entitlement, the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000, is currently awaiting Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> Enactment of the Bill will enable persons aged 65 or over, who decide that they wish to avail of private health insurance cover for the first time, or wish to renew cover after a material break in previous cover, to do so. I consider this to be an important provision of the Bill, which it is hoped will be enacted before the summer recess. This would enable the making of regulations to give effect to this provision.</P>

      <P>Financial assistance is not provided by my Department for the setting up of private nursing homes. However, in 1998, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, introduced a scheme of capital allowances for private nursing homes. The capital allowances apply to capital expenditure incurred from 3 December 1997, on building new nursing homes, upgrading or extending existing homes or converting existing buildings into nursing homes. The allowance is 15% of the capital expenditure in years one to six, with 10% in year seven. The allowances apply to nursing homes which are privately owned and registered with a health board in accordance with the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990. Provision has been made for a clawback of the allowances where the building ceases to be used as a nursing home within ten years.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance also introduced a scheme of tax allowances for convalescent homes in respect of capital expenditure in the Finance Act, 1999. These tax allowances will be available for private &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; facilities which provide an alternative to hospital care for patients recovering from an operation or intensive hospital treatment. The allowances apply to expenditure incurred on or after 2 December 1998 on the construction, extension or refurbishment of a convalescent home as well as the conversion of an existing building into a convalescent home. I understand that further details may be obtained from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The provision of housing modification grants for people with physical disabilities is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and they are provided through the relevant local authority. The criteria for this scheme are set out in the Department of the Environment and Local Government's Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant) Regulations, 1993. The housing modifications-adaptations required vary according to the level of disability involved in each particular case. It is, therefore, necessary for a trained professional, that is, an occupational therapist, to identify the most suitable modifications which will allow the individual to function adequately within the home. Without these modifications, some everyday functions may be difficult or impossible to carry out due to the nature of the particular disability. Health boards are involved with these grants to the extent that an assessment of the individual case must be carried out by an occupational therapist from the health board, in order for the grant to be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Occupational therapists generally carry out these assessments in the order in which they are referred from the local authority. However, I <Col N="1297" /> understand that in more urgent cases, certain assessments will be given priority as directed by the local authority. I have referred the Deputy's question to the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board with a request that he examine the circumstances of this individual and reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Under legislation, the issuing of medical cards to eligible persons is a matter for the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. In making such decisions, chief executive officers have regard to income guidelines as well as to any other individual factors relevant to the decision. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The operation of the medical card scheme is the subject of a review being carried out by the health board chief executive officers in keeping with a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on removing anomalies as well as on the needs of families with children and on barriers to take-up, including information deficits. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> In addition, the whole question of eligibility is being examined as part of the new health strategy. In recognition of the cross-sectoral issues impacting on health, an interdepartmental group is also planned to promote cross-departmental linkages and will be made up of a number of Departments, including the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. </P>

      <P>The drug refund and drug cost subsidisation schemes were merged into the drugs payment scheme with a threshold of £42 per month per individual or family unit on 1 July 1999. The primary aim of the scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and the scheme is designed to be more streamlined, user-friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable items was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme to ensure equity in relation to the products reimbursed by the State under both schemes. A comprehensive range of medicinal products authorised and recommended for use in the treatment of psoriasis are included in the common list. My Department has also made arrangements to make available certain essential emollient products of a non-proprietary nature which are also used in the treatment of this condition. My Department is currently reviewing the list with a view to making some additional products available.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors, on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This review involves the development of a long-term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors and will include a detailed assessment of future bed requirements in response to increasing demand and changing demographics.</P>
      <P>The OECD reported a bed population ratio for Ireland in 1996 of 3.4 acute beds per 1,000 population. The OECD findings show Ireland in 13th position out of 20 countries with regard to the bed: population ratio. This analysis will be incorporated in the national review.</P>
      <P>Addressing the problem of long waiting lists has been a priority matter for the Government and my Department in recent years. Significant increased investment in tackling this problem has contained and improved the situation. The issues involved in waiting lists are many and complex and bed shortage, is, of course, an aspect of the matter.</P>

      <Col N="1303" /> The First Schedule of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules for the assessment of dependency in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. Articles 5 and 6 of the First Schedule provide that the assessment of dependency shall include an evaluation of the ability of the person in respect of whom a subvention has been sought to carry out the tasks of daily living and of the level of social support available to the person. The tasks of daily living include, <i>inter alia</i>, degree of mobility, ability to dress or feed unaided and ability to communicate. The social support of the person is also taken into account with the use of indicators as outlined in Article 8 of the First Schedule, including housing conditions and the extend of community support.</P>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy concerning the number of patients who benefited from the subvention scheme or the number of health boards which offer subvention for out of state residents is not collected by this Department. I have asked the chief executive officers of the health boards-authority to investigate the matter and reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government strategy on road safety, 1998-2002, recognises that the influence of drugs on driving behaviour is an issue of increasing concern. Identification of the presence of drugs is however more complex than for alcohol. Consequently, considerably more work is needed to develop a more detailed regulatory regime in relation to drugs and driving. A number of research programmes are being carried out internationally in this area and the strategy commits the Government to monitoring and assessing these developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to advance research in relation to drugs and driving in Ireland, my Department has pledged an additional £200,000 to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety &ndash; MBRS &ndash; over 2000 and 2001 for a two-year programme of drug analysis of blood and urine specimens. Preliminary findings of this programme were made available last year by the MBRS. These findings are based on samples submitted to the MBRS between 1 July and 31 December 1999 which proved to be under the legal limit for alcohol. Within this sub-set of samples, further MBRS analysis <Col N="1304" /> screened some 37% as being positive for drugs, the most common being cannabis.</P>
    <P>These early findings underline the Government's view expressed in the road safety strategy that drugs and driving is an issue of growing concern. While it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, the research programme when completed will, along with other international analysis and research in this area, inform the need for possible changes in testing methods for the presence of drugs, changes in enforcement practice and procedures and possibly changes to existing legislation.</P>

      <P>The question of introducing a scheme whereby certain categories of dog owners could obtain a dog licence at a reduced rate has been examined. While it is recognised that a dog can provide both a sense of security and companionship to many elderly people and to people living alone, it would not, unfortunately, be feasible to introduce such a scheme without incurring substantial administrative costs and a loss of revenue to the local authorities, who rely on the revenue from the sale of dog licences to finance their dog control activities. At a practical level also, such a scheme would give rise to difficulties for local authorities in attempting to establish the true ownership of a dog which was covered by a reduced fee licence but which was being kept by a person who was not eligible for such a licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 to 152, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the Seveso II Directive is to prevent major accidents involving dangerous substances, and to limit the consequences of such accidents for human beings and the environment. Primary responsibility for transposition of the Directive rests with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, through the Health and Safety Authority &ndash; HSA. The European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 476 of 2000) therefore represent substantive transposition of the directive.</P>
      <P>My Department's responsibility relates to land use planning requirements as set out in article 12 of the directive, and certain external emergency planning issues. In relation to emergency planning, I recently designated county councils and county borough corporations as &ldquo;local competent authorities&rdquo; under the powers conferred on me by article 5 of S.I. No. 476 of 2000.</P>
      <P>Article 12 of the directive has two fundamental requirements regarding land use planning, that is, that land use policies include objectives for the prevention of major accidents and for limiting their consequences, through controls on development both within and around Seveso establishments, and that procedures are put in place to ensure that technical advice is available to planning authorities in the context of land use decision-making. The requirements in relation to land use policies have been transposed by virtue of section 10 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 &ndash; No. 30 of 2000 &ndash; which was commenced on 1 January 2001. This provision makes it mandatory for each local authority to include in its development plan objectives for the control of development within, and in the vicinity of, Seveso establishments for the purposes of reducing the risk, or limiting the consequences, of a major accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the making available of technical advice to planning authorities, my Department wrote to planning authorities in July 1999 advis<Col N="1306" /> ing them to operate as if the directive's requirements were in place. Since then, planning authorities have been requesting, and taking into consideration, technical advice from the HSA in the context of Seveso-related planning decisions. More recently, article 29 of S.I. No. 476 of 2000 placed a statutory obligation on the HSA to respond, within specified time frames, to requests from planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála for technical advice.</P>
    <P>Work on the regulations which will give statutory effect to the procedural arrangements for planning authorities requesting advice from the HSA is at an advanced stage. These regulations will be included as part of the main development control regulations which I propose to submit to the Oireachtas for approval very shortly. This will complete the formal transposition of the directive. </P>
    <P>I have received correspondence on the implications of the directive for the Cork area. I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority is or may be concerned. However, I have been advised by the HSA that advice provided by the authority in respect of individual planning applications is backed by risk assessment which stands up to international scrutiny. With regard to any resource implications for local authorities, it is a matter for each individual authority to assess the resources required to discharge their obligations arising under S.I. No. 476 of 2000. I am not aware of any requests for additional resources having been received in my Department. Any such requests would be considered on their individual merits.</P>

The paper will also seek to clarify the benefits as well as the operational and economic implications of requiring seat belts to be fitted in school buses. I intend that the forthcoming paper will support a public consultation which will provide all interested parties with the opportunity to respond and assist in developing practical improvements in relation to school bus safety.</P>

      <P>Under Part M of the building regulations all business premises provided since 1 June 1992 &ndash; either by new construction or structural alteration of an existing building &ndash; must incorporate access for people with disabilities.

      <P>I would hope that any business people refurbishing older, pre-June 1992, shopping premises would seek to provide access for people with disabilities, as part of a quality customer service to all customers. It is estimated that around 10% of the population could be formally classified as disabled. However, a much wider group would benefit from improved access including elderly customers, people recovering from illness whose movement is temporarily impaired, parents wheeling prams or accompanied by young children, and customers of all categories wheeling shopping trolleys in and out of supermarkets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the HFA income related loan scheme which was available in the early 1980s. This loan scheme gave access to home ownership to many people for whom the high repayments burden in the first few years of a conventional annuity mortgage was a deterrent. The income related nature of the payments means that unlike in the case of ordinary mortgages, account is taken of fluctuations in borrowers' incomes thus enabling the real burden of loan repayments to be spread over the duration of the loan. This method of repayment protects the borrower against the short-term effects of a loss of income due to unemployment or illness.</P>
      <P>While some 15,600 loans were advanced in the 1982 to 1986 period only 3,500 were outstanding at 1 December 2000. The numbers of loans outstanding continue to decline as borrowers repay and redeem their loans. Similar to all local authority house purchase loans, borrowers are free to redeem such loans and refinance in the private sector at no additional cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> In cases where borrowers are experiencing difficulty in making repayments on the income related basis due to fluctuations in their incomes they can opt to make their repayments on an annuity basis. This facility was introduced with effect from 1 July 1987 to ensure that the loan is repaid over a specific time period. Borrowers whose capital balance increases in any given year are advised of this and given options to increase their repayments. The income related loan means that they have no contractual obligation to increase repayments.</P>
    <P>The risk of not clearing the loan principal would only arise where the borrower's payments remained in the long-term below the interest charged, which would normally only occur in the event of long-term unemployment. With effect from 1 January 1996 the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was extended to income related loans. The SWA scheme is designed to assist any borrower who is in receipt of social welfare income. The objective is to prevent the balances outstanding on the loan accounts of those who qualify from increasing during the period when they qualify for assistance. This is achieved through a combination of the borrowers repayments, the SWA assistance and the Housing Finance Agency freezing the interest on any debt in excess of the loan advanced less any arrears. </P>
    <P>The interest rate on income related loans issued since 1 July 1983 is calculated in June each year and is based on inflation in mid-May plus a variable margin which is currently 4.3%, excluding 0.67% for mortgage protection. In the year ending 30 June 2000, the interest rate was 9.5%, that is, variable margin of 4.3% plus inflation of 5.2%. The interest rate for the year ending June 2001 will be calculated when the mid-May inflation rate is known.</P>

      <Quest>the regulations in relation to the phased withdrawal of rent allowance from people who take up community employment schemes or who take up normal employment, either directly or after completion of a community employment scheme; and if he will outline the procedure which applicants should follow.</Quest>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Under the terms of the SWA, scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>SWA is subject to a means test. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Most recipients pay more than £6 towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SWA is not normally payable to people in full-time employment. However arrangements have been in place for some years which allow people on approved employment schemes such as community employment to retain part of their rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to a gross household income limit of £250 per week and certain other conditions. Following discussions with the social partners under Partnership 2000 substantial improvements in the conditions relating to the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements were introduced from 6 April 2000. The £250 per month limit on the amount of rent supplement payable was abolished and the sharp withdrawal of support at the end of the third year was removed, the supplement now being withdrawn on a tapered basis over a four year period, <Col N="1311" /> that is, 75% in year one, 50% in year two, 25% in year three and 25% in year four. As a result, many participants in CE schemes now retain a greater amount of rent supplement than they would have done under the earlier arrangements. This is particularly the case for families.</P>
    <P>In no circumstances do the new rules result in a lower rate of rent supplement than is payable under the standard rules of SWA for participants of CE schemes. All such recipients are entitled to either the gradually reducing amount that can be retained under the transitional arrangements described above or the amount that is normally paid under the standard rules of SWA described earlier, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>A further initiative came into effect from 28 August 2000 to encourage people to avail of any full time job without having to go through an employment programme. Therefore, anyone who has been unemployed for 12 months or more and who moves from a welfare payment into a full-time job will be allowed to retain their rent or mortgage interest supplement on the same basis as those participating on employment programmes such as the CE scheme.</P>
    <P>People who take up full-time employment directly without availing of an approved employment programme or who were unemployed for less than 12 months would not normally be entitled to retain rent or mortgage interest supplement.</P>
    <P>An application for rent or mortgage interest supplement can be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre. The conditions for receiving and retaining rent and mortgage interest supplement will be examined as part of the review of the SWA scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations.</P>

      <P>Following an examination by a medical assessor of my Department, the extent of her loss of faculty as a result of the accident was assessed at 15%. She was also found to be incapable of work but as this incapacity was not deemed to arise from the loss of faculty due to the occupational accident, a deciding officer decided that she was not entitled to unemployability supplement.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs, subject to certain conditions prescribed in legislation. The scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding individual cases.</P>
      <P>The legislation governing SWA requires that an individual has made an application for any benefit or assistance payment to which they may have an entitlement or that they have registered for work with FÁS if they are of working age. </P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance and while awaiting the outcome of this application sought assistance from the community welfare officer at the local health centre under the SWA scheme. A basic rate of SWA was put in payment. The application for UA was refused on the grounds that the individual was deemed not to be genuinely seeking work and this decision was upheld on appeal.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances, the person concerned does not satisfy the qualification criteria for SWA because she is not making reasonable efforts to seek employment. Accordingly, payment of SWA will cease and the person will be required to reapply for unemployment assistance, as she is of working age.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my <Col N="1313" /> Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding individual cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which clients are required to pay from their own resources towards their accommodation cost. In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate SWA rate.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is a lone parent with one child. She receives a one parent family payment of £100.70 and is paying £120 per week rent. The maximum reasonable rent limit for a lone parent with one child as set by the South Eastern Health Board is £90 per week. She had been in receipt of a rent supplement of £75.50 per week, which included a £5 per week deduction in respect of an overpayment. This rate was calculated by deducting the minimum contribution, £6, and her assessable means of £3.50, representing the difference between her OPFP payment and the appropriate rate of SWA, from the £90 rent limit.</P>
      <P>A recent review of her rent supplement brought to light the fact that she has been in receipt of a reduced rate of unemployment benefit since 13 November 2000. This additional income was not declared to the community welfare officer and accordingly has resulted in an increased overpayment. Her rent supplement was recalculated to take account of her increased income and is now in payment at the rate of £38.80 per week. However the minimum contribution of £6 per week was inadvertently omitted in the recalculation. The current maximum amount of rent supplement payable in this case is £32.80 per week.</P>

      <P>An age breakdown of the number of children in respect of whom continued <Col N="1314" /> child dependant allowances are payable by virtue of their being engaged in full-time education is provided in Table 1.</P>
      <P>Data on the number of recipients in receipt of long-term social welfare payments who are claiming continued CDAs in respect of children who remain in full-time education beyond 18 years are not readily available.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, currently where a parent is receiving a pension or other long-term payment from my Department, CDAs are paid up to age 22 where the young person remains in full-time education. In the case of short-term payments, CDAs are only paid up to the age of 18. The Government has made a commitment to extend child dependant allowances to all social welfare recipients where the child is under 22 and in full-time education in the lifetime of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>The question of providing for the payment of continued CDAs for a further year is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, having regard to available resources and competing priorities, including existing PPF commitments. It is estimated that it would cost an additional £1.2 million in a full year to extend, by a further year, the payment of continued CDAs to recipients of long-term social welfare payments who have children in full-time education. The proposed measure would benefit approximately 1,660 child dependants. </P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 164 and 178 together.</P>
      <P>I would like to begin by again expressing my sympathies and condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of the two members of the Garda Síochána who lost their lives in this tragic accident. The young men who died paid the ultimate price in the service of their fellow citizens. Their sudden and untimely deaths are, however, an example of the dangers that each member of the Garda Síochána can face in the discharge of their daily duties and we should never forget this.</P>
      <P>Returning to the question asked by the Deputy, I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently a total of 1,355 cars in the Garda fleet and that the average age of the car fleet is two years. While there are cars in excess of this average age in the fleet, I am also informed that older models are not used as patrol cars. They are utilised on special enquiries such as drugs investigations, missing persons investigations, murder investigations etc.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that every effort will be made to replace the older cars this year. The Garda fleet is being constantly upgraded in order to ensure that the most modern facilities are available to members of the Garda Síochána in the performance of their duties. Provision is made in the Garda Vote each year for the purchase and delivery of cars for the Garda fleet.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that cars are purchased for the Garda fleet and allocated &ndash; as required &ndash; for purposes that are suitable to their capabilities. Not every car purchased for the Garda fleet is suitable for driving at high speeds. It should also be remembered that just because a vehicle is ten years old, it does not mean the vehicle is mechanically defective. Garda cars are subject to the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations and are also regularly serviced and maintained in accordance with the manufacturers instructions.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the discretion of local management and drivers in the use of Garda vehicles is an accepted part of the every day operational nature of policing.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that Ireland formally ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination at the end of December 2000. The Deputy will recall that, on 15 December 2000, the Dáil had passed a motion approving the terms of the convention, pursuant to Article 29.5 of the Constitution, following an earlier debate on 7 December 2001 before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The UN convention entered into force for the State on 28 January 2001. Ratification of the convention fulfilled a commitment in the Action Plan for the Millennium and affirmed the Government's ongoing commitment to ban racial discrimination in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1965 convention is the major multilateral treaty embodying obligations on UN member <Col N="1317" /> states to ban racial discrimination. It has been recognised as the centrepiece of the United Nations ongoing efforts to tackle racism and racial discrimination. The convention was opened for signature in 1965. Ireland signed in 1968 but was not in a position to ratify until its domestic law was in conformity with the requirements of the convention. The terms of the convention require the state parties to have in place at domestic level an effective means of redress for those who may experience racial discrimination.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation sponsored by me, namely, the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, enabled Ireland to ratify the UN convention. With the coming into operation of the Employment Equality Act on 18 October 1999 and the Equal Status Act on 25 October 2000, Ireland now has in place a comprehensive anti-discrimination legal code and an equality infrastructure to support it in the form of the Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations. The Office of the Director of Equality Investigations is the first forum for redress under the Acts for individuals who have experienced racial discrimination.</P>
    <P>On ratification Ireland opted to accept the right of individuals or groups of individuals, who have exhausted all available domestic remedies, to petition the UN committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, about any violation by Ireland of rights set forth in the Convention. Ireland will be expected to submit its initial national report to the UN committee by early next year, detailing the legislative, judicial, administrative or other measures which it has adopted to give effect to the provisions of the convention.</P>

I understand that the board proposes to operate the scheme on a pilot basis initially at selected law centres throughout the country and that Wexford is one of the centres that has been selected by the board for this purpose. I would expect that this development will have a positive effect on waiting times at that centre.</P>
    <P>In this context, I am advised by the board that it has no plans at present to assign an additional solicitor to Wexford Law Centre, however, I am assured by the board that the situation will be kept under review in the light of future demand for legal services in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I must state that I am somewhat limited in what I can say in this case as the matter is due before Cork Circuit Court on 1 May 2001. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that a single vehicle accident occurred at Lehenaghmore, Togher, Cork, at approximately 6.25 p.m. on 3 May 1999 and that there were seven occupants in the vehicle and one of the passengers was fatally injured. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that a full investigation was conducted into the circumstances of the accident and that this involved, among other things, a detailed examination of the vehicle which had been extensively damaged.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the car was preserved in the car compound at Togher Garda station until 28 June 1999 when it was removed to a scrapyard. I understand that on the 29 June 1999, the driver of the car delivered a prepared statement to Togher Garda station, setting out his version of the circumstances of the accident and that the Garda file on the matter was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for direction on 21 July 1999.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that the DPP's directions were received on 1 December 1999 and were that the driver be prosecuted for dangerous driving causing death. These proceedings commenced on 22 December 1999 when the accused was arrested and brought before Cork District Court. The accused was subsequently sent forward for trial to Cork Circuit Court and the case stands adjourned to 1 May 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 23 February 2000, however, a solicitor acting for the defendant wrote to the acting State solicitor requesting permission to have the vehicle examined. Inquiries were immediately undertaken by the gardaí to locate the vehicle and it was subsequently located in the scrapyard but the engine had been removed and some damage had been caused during storage. I am informed that the vehicle, minus its engine, was returned to Togher Garda station on 2 June 2000 <Col N="1321" /> and the defendant's solicitor was informed and an assessor, on behalf of the defendant, subsequently examined the vehicle.</P>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the defendant commenced judicial review proceedings before the High Court, seeking a permanent injunction preventing his trial on the charge of dangerous driving causing death proceeding.</P>
    <P>In an <i>ex tempore </i>judgment delivered on the 29 March 2001, the High Court granted the relief sought. This was without prejudice to the defendant being prosecuted on any other charges that may have arisen. The question of any appeal in relation to that decision is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions who is independent in the performance of his functions.</P>
    <P>In relation to the circumstances surrounding the disposal of the vehicle, I am informed by the Garda authorities that an investigation has commenced in relation to this matter and whether it amounts to a breach of the Garda Síochána Disciplinary Regulations. The Garda authorities have also informed me that procedures in relation to the retention or disposal of vehicles involved in accidents will be examined taking into account the implications of the High Court judgment and any new procedures will be introduced where necessary.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of concern that the family of the victim first learned of the outcome of the High Court case from media reports. I am informed by the Garda authorities in this regard that the family were in regular touch with the gardaí at Togher and that when the case went before the High Court the process and the problems arising were explained to the family. However, as the case was dealt with by way of affidavits the gardaí were not notified of the date when the case was due be heard before the High Court.</P>
    <P>While all of us must be careful not to say anything which could prejudice any future proceedings that might arise in this case, I accept fully that should it not be possible to pursue a serious case because of some procedural or other fault this would be a matter of deep concern. In the circumstances, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to keep me fully informed of developments in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Parliamentary Questions No. 1 and 2 today. In so far as allegations of Sinn Féin activities in north Kerry are concerned, as I mentioned in this House on Tuesday night in the course of a debate on a Private Members' motion, I have received a report from the gardaí about the alleged activities. A Garda investigation is continuing in this matter. Similarly, in so far as the incident in Wexford is concerned, I am advised by the Garda authorities that investigations are also continuing.</P>
      <P>These are very serious allegations. It would be completely intolerable for any person or persons to seek to usurp the functions of the Garda Síochána in the investigation of crime. As I say, Garda investigations into these matters are continuing and the House will appreciate that it would not be right for me to comment in detail on what is alleged to have happened. It is very important that nothing is said in this House which might prejudice or adversely affect the investigations.</P>
      <P>As regards the general issue of vigilantism, the Government's position is simple &ndash; there is no place in our society for vigilantism no matter how it is dressed up. It cannot and will not be accepted. The Garda Síochána has a statutory duty to investigate crime in this State. Individuals or groups who seek to usurp the functions of the Garda Síochána or who engage in intimidation, assaults or threats will face the full rigour of the law.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider amending Statutory Instrument No. 191 of 1999 to enable small claims courts to be utilised not only by consumers but also by others such as retailers and auctioneers who have genuine small claims that could be processed before the small claims court at substantially lesser expense than would arise in District Court proceedings.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The small claims procedure is a special mechanism for dealing with consumer claims within the District Court structure which is designed to handle such claims speedily, inexpensively and informally without involving a solicitor. It is administered by the Small Claims Registrar whose function it is to process the claims and, if possible, reach a satisfactory settlement without the need for a court hearing. <Col N="1323" /> Should this prove unsuccessful the claim will go before the District Court judge.</P>
      <P>The small claims procedure was initially introduced on a pilot basis in 1991 and was extended nationwide in 1993 following on from the success of the pilot scheme. The current fee payable for using the procedure is £6 and the monetary limit which applies to claims made under the procedure is £1,000. In the event of the matter being referred to the sheriff a further fee of £6 applies, but this amount is refunded if the sheriff succeeds in executing the court order. This may be done in any case where a party does not comply with the court order.</P>
      <P>To avail of the procedure a consumer must have bought goods or services for private use from someone selling them in the course of business. Claims may be made for bad workmanship or faulty goods as far as most everyday transactions are concerned but not for debts or personal injuries. When the scheme was extended in 1993, the non-return of rent deposits and minor damage to privately-owned property were included.</P>
      <P>The operation of the small claims procedure, which is essentially consumer focused, was reviewed in 1999 and such issues as the monetary limit which applies and the scope of the procedure were examined. Following the review, I increased the monetary limit which applies to claims made under the procedure from £600 to £1,000. The review committee considered that the broadening of the procedure to include small businesses would represent a significant expansion of the procedure and one which the Courts Service should examine following its establishment.</P>
      <P>The Courts Service has indicated that to effect the kind of change suggested by the Deputies would be likely to change the whole nature of the small claims procedure and would probably have the effect of reducing the current level of service to consumers.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputies to my replies to Parliamentary Questions No. 61 and 152 of 7 February 2001 and No. 88 of 15 November 2000 which dealt with the issue of the entitlement of asylum seekers to enter into paid employment.</P>
      <P>The Government, as an exceptional measure, agreed on 26 July 1999 that those asylum seekers who had been in this country for more than 12 months, who were still awaiting a final determination of their application for refugee status and who had been compliant with their obligations as asylum seekers should be given the right to seek work. The arrangement applied to those who sought asylum here up to 26 July 1999 as soon as they crossed the 12 month threshold.</P>
      <P>In December 1999, the Government decided to remove the requirement that an employer must obtain a work permit before employing asylum seekers covered by the 26 July 1999 Government decision. The Government also decided that each eligible asylum seeker should be issued with a letter confirming entitlement to work for presentation to potential employers and my Department arranged accordingly. To date, over 2,650 such letters have issued.</P>
      <P>As I previously informed the House, it is not proposed to allow asylum applicants who are not covered by the aforementioned July 1999 decision to take up paid employment pending a final decision being made on their applications. I have been informed by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that the number of asylum seekers who have been here for more than six months and who are still awaiting a first stage decision is 8,792. I have also been informed by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal that there were 2,503 appeal cases on hands at 31 March 2001. Approximately 2,300 of these appeals relate to applicants who made first stage applications for refugee status more than six months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 5 July 2000 the Government announced approval for the immediate recruitment of 370 additional staff for asylum case processing and appeals and to deal with consequential repatriations with the possibility of more staff being made available in the future. This will allow a number of strategic objectives to be achieved, namely, greatly increasing processing capacity, including appeals, to deliver more speedy decisions in relation to applications for refugee status leading, in due course, to the completion to finality of the processing of all new asylum applications within a six month period which will ensure that those who qualify clearly as refugees will receive decisions on their applications much more speedily and that applications where there is clearly no basis for qualification will also be dealt with on a faster basis; the elimination of the <Col N="1325" /> asylum applications currently on hands as soon as possible; and dealing with the increased numbers of repatriations which are expected to arise in respect of persons whose applications for refugee status are refused. The recruitment process for these additional staff is almost complete. Some 130 of the 370 posts are to be filled in an atypical fashion, that is, a special competition organised by my Department. Interviews for these posts at clerical officer and executive officer level have recently taken place and successful candidates will be offered the positions in the next few weeks. Additional accommodation is also in the process of being sourced.</P>

      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question has been in the State since 1995. He was granted leave to remain in the State in 1997 and this has been renewed annually since. Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, at his absolute discretion, grant a certificate of naturalisation, where statutory provisions are complied with. These provisions require that an applicant is of full age; is of good character; has had a period of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intends in good faith to continue to reside in the <Col N="1326" /> State after naturalisation; and has made, either before a Justice of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
      <P>Based on the information on file about the person referred to, it would appear that he is eligible to apply for a certificate of naturalisation. The fact that an application is accepted should not be taken as an indication that the application will be successful.</P>
      <P>It may also be open to the person referred to make a declaration of post nuptial citizenship. Section 8 of the Act provides that a person who is not an Irish citizen may, following three years marriage to an Irish citizen, lodge a declaration accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship, provided that the marriage is subsisting at the date of lodgement of the declaration and the couple are living together as husband and wife and the spouse who is an Irish citizen submits an affidavit to that effect.</P>

      <P>Applications for naturalisation from the parents and children referred to in the Deputy's question were received in my Department in December 1997. The departmental files indicate that application forms in respect of the two minor children were returned as they did not meet the statutory requirement that applicants must be of full age. The parents were notified in December 2000 that their applications had been approved and certificates of naturalisation issued to them in February 2001.</P>
      <P>In accordance with conditions stipulated in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, the Minister may waive the statutory requirements, including the age requirement, where the application is made by a naturalised parent or guardian of a minor child of the applicant. New applications by the naturalised parents were accepted on behalf of the two minor children in March 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the various procedures involved in processing an application for a certificate of naturalisation, together with the high number of applications being received, the average processing time at present is approximately two years. Extra resources have recently been allocated to the citi<Col N="1327" /> zenship area of my Department and these will impact considerably on the current processing time. In order to be fair to all applicants, applications are dealt with in chronological order. I have no plans to change this policy at the present time.</P>

      <P>Following the purchase of Myshall Retreat Centre, County Carlow, by the Office of Public Works for use as an accommodation centre for asylum seekers, representations were made by the South Eastern Health Board and the Autistic Society of Ireland seeking to have the property made available for use as a residential service for children with disabilities who require specialist care. Both organisations indicated that there is a shortage of such facilities in this country and that the property would be suitable for accommodating such a service subject to refurbishment and other modifications being undertaken.</P>
      <P>While the reception and integration agency, which is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers, continues to operate against the backdrop of a severe shortage of accommodation, it is not my intention that such accommodation should be sourced to the detriment of vulnerable groups such as children with disabilities. In these circumstances, I directed that the Office of Public Works be informed that I had no objections to the property being made available to the South Eastern Health Board for use as a centre for these children.</P>

    <P>The difference between the amounts committed and the amounts paid out to date reflects, in the case of capital projects, the fact that payments are made in stages as work progresses. In many instances building contractors are unable to commence work on capital projects as soon as had been expected due to other work commitments. In the case of staffing support applications, the difference between the amounts committed and the amounts paid out to date reflects the fact that the grants are allocated over a three year period and the requirements placed on groups in relation to recruitment procedures.</P>
    <P>The capital grant scheme for private sector child care providers catering for more than 20 children was announced only in October 2000. Up to the end of December 2000, 18 capital projects were under consideration under this measure. At year end, six of these capital projects had been approved funding totalling £198,756 but none of these projects had drawn down funds. A further nine of these capital projects have been approved since bringing the total allocation for these 15 projects to £435,630. Up to 30 March 2001, fund<Col N="1329" /> ing of £100,364 had been drawn down under this measure.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has asked for details of the amount applied for in each category but I am not in a position to provide meaningful information on this. The amount sought obviously varies depending on the nature of service being provided. Our experience is that the amount applied for may not accurately reflect the needs of the applicant and, in some cases, as part of the appraisal process, the original figure may be revised upwards. In these circumstances to provide the information requested may be confusing in terms of the approvals granted.</P>
    <P>Under the staffing grant scheme for community based/not-for-profit child care providers, the normal maximum funding available to full-time child care services is £50,000 per annum for up to a three year period or £25,000 for part-time or sessional services.</P>
    <P>In general, in terms of capital projects, funding is available towards the purchase, improvement or construction of an asset as well as the purchase of permanently based child care equipment. However, ongoing running costs, staff costs and consumables are not eligible expenditure under this measure. Work on the project, that is, construction work, must commence within one year of the date of the grant approval and must be completed within three years of the approval of the grant.</P>
    <P>The capital grant measure for small scale private child care providers and the capital grant scheme for private sector child care providers catering for more than 20 children are, in essence, the same. Under these measures, the maximum funding available per project is £40,000 and applicants must have secured a minimum private financial contribution of 35% of the cost of the project.</P>
    <P>There is no upper limit on the level of funding available under the capital grant scheme for community-based/not-for-profit group(s). Projects in this category are assessed in terms of the overall criteria of the equal opportunities child care programme which include the quality of the proposal, the number of child care places created or sustained and the level of disadvantage in the area concerned.</P>

      <P>I have been informed that there is no record in the immigration and citizenship division of my Department of an application for Irish citizenship having been received from the person referred to by the Deputy. Based on the information contained in representations received from the Deputy, it appears that the person referred to is eligible to make a declaration of post-nuptial citizenship on foot of his marriage to an Irish citizen and I have asked my officials to send the appropriate forms to him.</P>
      <P>Due to the various procedures involved in processing a declaration of post-nuptial citizenship, together with the high number of applications being received, the average processing time is approximately 12 months. The acquisition of Irish citizenship is not contingent on the renunciation of the citizenship of another jurisdiction. However, the Deputy should be aware that persons who obtain Irish citizenship may, as a result, lose or be at risk of losing their existing citizenship.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the director general of the Prison Service that statistics are not maintained in such a way as to enable the precise information sought by the Deputy to be readily available. The compilation and analysis of statistics must be done manually and as this is an extremely time consuming and staff intensive process it has not been possible to release staff for this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new information technology programme, authorised by me, for the Prison Service is well advanced. As part of the programme a comprehensive prisoner records database is currently being deployed across the Prison Service. This programme will address the lack of accessible <Col N="1332" /> information about prisoners, provide management with necessary information and enable the automation of many existing functions.</P>
    <P>In an effort to redress the overcrowding problem, which led to prisoners being released early, some of whom reoffended, I have presided over an unprecedented investment in our prison infrastructure. In all more than 1,200 additional prison spaces have been provided with a further 700 closed spaces on the way. As a direct consequence of this ongoing prison building programme, there has been a significant reduction in the number of persons on temporary release. Of the total population of persons under sentence, the proportion on temporary release has declined from 19% in 1997 to a current figure of about 6%. The majority of prisoners on early release at present are on structured programmes, in many cases under the direct supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service. Many of those not on structured programmes have been temporarily released for valid compassionate reasons such as ill health or family related circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>All prisoners have the opportunity to make requests for temporary release through their prison governor. Decisions on temporary release applications and the general management of prison sentences are made either by myself or by senior officials from the prisons division of my Department. In addition, the sentence review group advises me in relation to the administration of the sentences of long-term prisoners.</P>
      <P> Review meetings are held on a regular basis in each institution to facilitate the exchange of information and aid decision making. Each meeting is chaired by the governor with the attendance of senior prison management, probation and welfare staff, chaplains, teachers, other prison staff and an official from the prisons division of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before granting temporary release careful consideration is given in each individual case to a number of factors including the nature and seriousness of the offence, previous record, behaviour in custody, length of sentence served and any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration. The primary concern in considering whether to grant temporary release is the safety of the public. It is important to note that decisions are only made following consultations with the Garda and local prison officials. Other matters considered are whether the pris<Col N="1333" /> oner has engaged constructively with the various prison based therapeutic services such as the Probation and Welfare Service, educational and work training programmes, and/or drug treatment programmes.</P>
    <P>In the majority of cases, temporary release is granted for constructive and rehabilitative reasons. For example, a prisoner may be released to attend educational and/or training programmes or courses. Another reason is to participate in work training with recognised agencies such as CERT or PACE. The aim of this form of temporary release is to help the prisoner with employment prospects on the outside which will have the effect of reducing the risk of reoffending. In addition, short periods of temporary release to visit family members may be granted to prisoners in an effort to reduce the effects of institutionalisation and to aid familiarisation with the outside world.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that in the past a persistent high level of overcrowding in the committal institutions in the Dublin area &ndash; Mountjoy Prison and St Patrick's Institution &ndash; resulted in the granting of release in an unstructured manner to many offenders at an early stage in their sentences. As a direct result of my prisons building programme, there has been a significant reduction in the number of prisoners on temporary release from a daily average of 463 in September 1997 to around 200 at present.</P>
    <P>We now have a situation where for the first time in 25 years we can accommodate almost all those sentenced by the courts for the full duration of their sentences and that the vast majority of prisoners on temporary release are following a structured programme as part of their rehabilitation. I qualify this statement only by reference to the female prison population where we currently have higher than anticipated committal numbers and for whom extra spaces will be provided shortly.</P>

    <P>Where possible, it is the aim of the Prisons Service to provide for single cell occupancy for all sentenced prisoners. Exceptions are made for some prisoners who actually seek to double-up. They do so especially if they are in prison for the first time. Prisoners may ask to share a cell with a friend or relative in custody and such requests are facilitated where possible. Doubling up may also occur from time to time if there is a concern about the physical-mental health of a prisoner.</P>
    <P>When overcrowding was at its height in our prisons, a large number of single cells were converted into multiple occupancy cells. This was necessary in a number of our closed prisons, particularly Mountjoy Prison, Cork Prison, St. Patrick's Institution, Limerick Prison, Wheatfield Place of Detention and the Curragh. St. Patrick's Institution has already reverted to full single cell accommodation.</P>
    <P>As part of the ongoing prisons building programme, with 1,207 additional places provided since I took office, it is the intention to revert these cells back to their single cell occupancy status. The provision for a further 700 prison spaces, as part of the next phase of the building programme, will facilitate this.</P>

    <P>Since I took office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have presided over an unprecedented investment in our prison infrastructure. In all, over 1,200 additional prison spaces have been provided with a further 700 closed spaces on the way. The additional spaces already provided have greatly reduced overcrowding and I am hopeful that completion of the prison building programme will eliminate it altogether.</P>
    <P>We now have a situation where for the first time in 25 years we can accommodate almost all those sentenced by the courts for the full duration of their sentences. I qualify this statement only by reference to the female prison population where we have higher than anticipated committal numbers and for whom extra spaces will be provided shortly.</P>
    <P>The overall percentage of sentenced prisoners on temporary release has, as a result of the Government's building programme to date, been reduced from 19% in 1997 to a figure of about 6%. It is important to bear in mind also that almost all prisoners on early release are on structured programmes, in many cases under the direct supervision of the probation and welfare service. Those not on structured programmes have been temporarily released for valid compassionate reasons, ill health or family related circumstances.</P>
    <P>The impact of this cut in unplanned temporary releases on the level of indictable crime in this jurisdiction is clear and irrefutable. The whole architecture of community sanctions depends on the custodial places being available to ensure that the sanction of last resort can be applied to offenders if they do not avail of the non-custodial options open to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 to 204, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 165 and 166 of 22 February 2001 concerning the procedures adopted by the Garda Síochána, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety and the State Laboratory at Abbotstown in dealing with cases of suspect drug driving.</P>
      <P>To clarify matters, the testing of samples for the presence of drugs is carried out at the State Laboratory, at Abbotstown, and that my Department has no statutory responsibility for the funding or equipment of either the Medical Bureau or the State Laboratory. Also, responsibility for all road traffic legislation including the law on driving under the influence of drugs and any question of possible legislative change, is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> In relation to procedure, I am informed by the Garda authorities that where a person is suspected of driving or being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant, which includes a drug, a sample of breath, blood or urine is taken at the station. Where a garda is of the view that a person may be under the influence of a drug a request to have the blood or urine sample(s) analysed for drugs is sent to the Medical Bureau for Road Safety by the local superintendent.</P>
    <P>The blood-urine sample is sent by registered post or delivered by hand to the Medical Bureau and is then forwarded to the State Laboratory for drug testing. The bureau has ultimate responsibility for analysis and the issue of certificates of analysis. I understand that internal arrangements exist between the Medical Bureau and the State Laboratory regarding the analysis and the transporting of samples.</P>
    <P>In relation to the study by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, I understand that of the 338 samples screened, 37% were positive for drugs. Further research by the Medical Bureau on drugs and driving is being carried out in 2001 and I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda and the Medical Bureau are co-operating on a research initiative into drugs and driving. When this research is concluded it will provide important information on the type of drugs being used by drivers and a profile of the drivers themselves. A consequence of this will be the ability to target, by way of Garda enforcement initiatives, categories of drivers most likely to be involved in drug driving.</P>
    <P>Under Operation Lifesaver the detection of drink-drug driving is a given a high priority along with speeding, seat belt offences and dangerous-careless driving offences. In relation to the number of charges for driving under the influence of drugs for the years 1996-2000, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos 167 and 168 of 22 February 2001. Statistics for prosecutions taken for drug driving are not readily available as prosecutions under section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended, relate to an intoxicant and statistics are not collated in a way that can distinguish between prosecutions involving alcohol, drugs or any combination of drugs or of alcohol and drugs.</P>
    <P>In relation to equipment, I understand that there is no road-side equipment available on the market similar to the road-side breathalyser which can test for the presence of drugs. Incidentally, breath testing equipment which is used by the Garda for the testing of alcohol is tested and supplied by the Medical Bureau.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that there will be no let up in the ongoing Garda campaign against driving under the influence of an intoxicant, including drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue):</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal position in relation to trespass is that it is a civil wrong and, for the most part, falls to be addressed by means of civil remedy. In that context, the usual remedy which an aggrieved property owner will seek is that of injunction. It is also the case that because trespass to land is actionable <i>per se</i>, it is not necessary to show damage in order to succeed although, if monetary damages are part of the remedy sought, it would be expected that appreciable loss would be proven.</P>
      <P>In certain circumstances, trespass may be dealt with under criminal law. The criminal law provisions dealing with trespass include a range of offences under the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971, and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994. The 1971 Act makes it an offence for a person to forcibly enter land, or remain in forcible occupation or to encourage or advocate the commission of an offence of forcible entry or occupation. The 1994 Act makes it an offence for a person to enter a building or part of it, including its vicinity with intent to commit an offence. It is also an offence for any person to trespass on any such place in such manner as causes or is likely to cause fear in another person, and the Garda has the power to direct a person to desist from acting in such a manner and-or to leave immediately the vicinity of the place concerned in a peaceable or orderly manner. It is an offence for any person to fail to comply with such a direction from the Garda. Any alleged breach of the criminal law in this respect should be reported to the Garda Síochána for investigation with a view to a criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>While I have no proposals to change the law in this area, my Department will continue to keep it under review.</P>

      <P>In establishing the young people's facilities and services fund in 1998, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion set up a national assessment committee, NAC, to prepare guidelines for the development of integrated plans in the target areas which meet the overall aims and objectives of the fund; to facilitate the establishment of the local structures charged with developing the plans and to assess the plans emanating from each of the target areas. The NAC makes recommendations to the Cabinet committee which makes decisions on funding to be allocated under the fund.</P>
      <P>The NAC is responsible for monitoring ongoing progress in implementing the plans and strategies approved and addressing any difficulties-issues arising.</P>

      <P>Under the national development plan funding of £100 million is provided for a tourism product investment scheme to be implemented by Bord Fáilte with proposals to be approved by an independent product management board. The scheme will be funded under sub-measures 1 to 3, inclusive of the local enterprise development priority within the regional operational programmes for the south and east and Border, midlands and west. Some £60 million has been provided for the S&amp;E regions and £40 million for the BMW region for the development of major attractors and clusters of existing attractions, special interest pursuits and tourism and environment management.</P>
      <P>Last December the regional OPs were approved by the European Commission. Under new procedures sub-measures 1 and 2 have had to be notified to the competition directorate of the Commission as a State aid. Despite our best endeavours, it is proving far longer than expected to get the necessary clearance and negotiations are still under way.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte will be in a position to invite proposals under this scheme once the State aids position has been resolved.</P>

      <P>In the context of the foot and mouth disease crisis, I have encouraged Irish people to consider holidaying at home this year. Domestic holidays are being backed by an intensive consumer and trade campaign undertaken by Bord Fáilte in conjunction with the regional tourism authorities and which is already under way.</P>
      <P>To make holidays in Ireland more attractive to the domestic consumer, I have also suggested to the tourism industry that they make a range of packages available that are attractively priced. Such a range could include golden age packages targeted at retired and pensioned people, as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte does not provide direct subsidies to holidaymakers. A measure along the lines proposed by the Deputy would require consideration by other Ministers such as the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, seeks to develop an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities; to assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation; to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities; and to encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</P>
      <P>Projects covering both indoor and outdoor activities can be considered under the programme but must be directly related to the provision of sport and recreation facilities and be of a capital nature, which, for the purpose of the programme, is defined as:</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the purchase, improvement or construction of an asset and includes any costs directly incurred in this process; and purchase of permanently based sports equipment, i.e. that it is securely housed, and will remain in use for 5 years or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2001 sports capital programme was advertised in mid-December 2000 with a closing date of 9 February 2001 for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,450 applications were received for the programme and are currently being evaluated against its assessment criteria. These are outlined in the guidelines which accompanied the application form but can be summarised as follows: the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will increase the levels of active participation in sport / recreational sport and / or result in improved standards of sporting performance and how such increases can be measured; the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the technical merits of the project, that is, does the project comply with standard technical specifications from the relevant governing body and statutory authorities, possession of planning permission; and the financial viability of the project &ndash; that is in addition to lottery funding, has the club/organisation sufficient funds or firm commitments for funding to complete the project within a realistic timeframe? Previous track record in fund raising is also taken into account &ndash; the level of local funding available; higher rating is given to projects with a significant local contribution; given realistic projections of income from the project, the extent to which the applicant will be <Col N="1344" /> able to maintain the project after completion; the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area, as defined by ADM Limited's indicators, and the current and planned levels of sport and/or recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority in developing their proposals and the outcome of these consultations; in the case of projects aimed at attracting people from disadvantaged areas, the strategies to be used to attract them; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; the priority of proposed improvements/facilities in relation to the club's or organisation's existing facilities; and the priorities for their individual sports as identified by the national governing bodies. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the 2001 sports capital programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>
    <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my Department, the Government has provided £45 million funding over the three year period 2000-02, effectively increasing the annual budget from £3 million per annum to £15 million over the period. All local authorities were invited to submit proposals for the development of pools to my Department by 31 July 2000 and all proposals received by that closing date are being processed under the present programme.</P>
    <P>In general, there are four stages in a swimming pool project &ndash; preliminary report stage, contract document stage, tender stage and construction stage. The Department's technical advisers evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval is issued from this Department.</P>
    <P>In assessing these proposals I will be having particular regard to a report commissioned from sports facility specialists ILAM Limited on the condition of pools constructed by local authorities between 1996 and 1981 and their finding that 30 pools are in need of specific refurbishment. My Department will give consideration to such matters as the need for a swimming pool in an area, suitability of the proposed site, future viability of the project, particularly in relation to operational and maintenance issues, construction and operating standards of existing facilities; satisfactory financial plan and the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds.</P>

      <P>In line with the aims of the sports capital programme to develop a planned approach to facility provision, clubs and community organisations are asked to consult with their local authority before making an application for funding.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Early Childhood Education sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education services for all children and emphasised the particular importance of early educational intervention in the case of children with certain special needs. Following publication of the White Paper, my Department carried out an extensive post consultation process with all those who made presentations to the National Forum for Early Childhood Education. The aim of these consultations was to seek the views of interested parties with regard to the implementation of the policies set out in the White Paper, on a phased basis, and to enable the necessary planning and preparatory work for implementation to be undertaken by my Department in line with the commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>More recently my Department sought and received proposals from third level institutions for a pilot project to develop early childhood education provision in pursuance of the objectives of the White Paper. It is envisaged that the pilot project will include the development of early education quality standards in relation to equipment and materials, staff qualifications, training, learning objectives, methodologies and curriculum; the development of a support framework to encourage compliance with quality standards by early education providers; the co-ordination and enhancement of early education provision with a particular focus on disadvantaged and special needs groups and the commissioning of a programme of research and development through which best practice in curriculum, teaching methodology and parent involvement may be implemented and evaluated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently assessing the proposals received and I hope to be in a position to make a further announcement about developments in early education very shortly. In the meantime, in view of the particular importance of early educational intervention in the case of certain special needs categories, I recently announced my decision to introduce a nationwide pre-school service for children with autism. Additional funding has been secured to support this development and my Department is currently making arrangements to develop this service. My Department does not offer financial support to <Col N="1348" /> parents of children with special needs to have them placed in Montessori or other similar pre-school settings. If the Deputy has any specific proposal I will have it investigated.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The key legal decision in relation to the educational entitlements of children with special needs was the judgment of the High Court in the Paul O'Donoghue case in 1993.</P>
      <P>This case concerned the educational entitlements of a child with severe-profound general learning disability. The court found that the child in question was not only educable but had a constitutional entitlement to an appropriate primary education. The precedent set in the O'Donoghue case was followed to a greater or lesser extent in a number of subsequent cases.</P>
      <P>Prior to the O'Donoghue judgment provision for children with severe-profound general learning disability was confined to a pilot programme which offered support to a limited number of children and operated on the basis of a pupil-teacher ratio of 12:1.</P>
      <P>Arising from the court's decision, my Department formally adopted a policy under which all children with severe-profound general learning disability are entitled to support at a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1 and with two special needs assistants per class.</P>
      <P>To date a total of 122 special classes involving 122 teachers and 244 special needs assistants have been allocated to address the educational needs of children with severe-profound general learning disability. Further such classes are being established in response to identified needs. Pupils attending these classes also attract special rates of capitation funding and funding is also provided to meet their special equipment needs.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the progress made since the O'Donoghue judgment, I am aware that there are a number of cases pending before the courts relating to the adequacy of education provision. I can assure the Deputy that I regard it as unacceptable that any parent, and particularly a parent of a child with special needs, should find it necessary to resort to litigation to secure their child's educational entitlements. I am confident that the recommendations which have recently been brought forward by the planning group on special education established in my Department will lead to the development of a more effective and efficient special education service. It is my intention to seek Government approval to proceed with these measures at an early date.</P>

      <P>In the period from April 2000 to March 2001, 56 court cases were initiated on behalf of children with special educational needs. Ten of these have been settled. Two cases were determined following a court hearing, while the remaining eight were the subject of agreement between the parties. In all cases involving minors, it is the practice to put the terms of a settlement before the court for its approval.</P>
      <P>There are currently 72 cases outstanding against my Department in respect of children and adults with special needs.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services, in the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, under a grants scheme introduced in 1992 under the terms of the PESP agreement. The PESP grant is paid as an addition to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives schools discretion as to the manner in which secretarial services are to be provided. Secretaries employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the school services support fund is a significant contribution towards enabling schools to meet their commitments. Under the fund, schools now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum <Col N="1352" /> payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year. Provision for secretarial support is a particular focus of this fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, was established in 1989 with the objective of providing second chance education and training opportunities for unemployed adults over the age of 21 and in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months. Participants in VTOS cease to receive unemployment payments and are paid training allowances of at least an equivalent amount. They are also paid travelling expenses, where they reside three miles from the centre and a meal allowance in line with those payable by FÁS.</P>
      <P>About 5,000 people participate annually in VTOS at an annual cost to the State of £32 million. It has proved very successful in opening up learning and progression opportunities for people who have been marginalised by unemployment. For each of the years 1994 to 2000, the percentage of participants who completed the programme and who progressed to work or further education was 70% or more.</P>
      <P>The Department's grant covers teaching and management costs, non-pay costs, and the payment of training, travel and meals allowances to participants. In relation to non-pay, the grant for such items as light, heat, rent, books and equipment and other general expenses is £15,000 per core group of 20 VTOS students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A training bonus of £25 per week was introduced in September 1999 for participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, that is, 12 months, as an incentive to encourage greater participation of <Col N="1355" /> the long-term unemployed in education and training programmes.</P>
    <P>A scheme of grants for child care for VTOS students was introduced in 1998 in order to facilitate the attendance of people who would otherwise be prevented from doing so by child care responsibilities. An adult educational guidance service has been initiated on a pilot basis, and a new management structure has been developed for the programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> The development of VTOS features strongly in the back to education initiative, as set out in the recent White Paper on adult education, Learning for Life. Under this measure, £1.027 billion will be provided under the national development plan over the period of the plan for the development of a number of programmes, including VTOS, which will involve a significant expansion of part-time options. The resources for the programme will be examined in that context.</P>
