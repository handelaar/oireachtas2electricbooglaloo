      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with four different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I shall call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. I now call on Deputy Shatter to state the matter on which he has given notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, pursuant to Standing Order 31, that the business of the House be adjourned to discuss an urgent matter of public importance, that is the abdication by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of his ministerial functions and his duty to maintain law and order in County Kerry, the taking over of these functions by Sinn Féin, which party in this week's edition of <i>The Kingdom</i> claims to have conducted a six month investigation into a spate of robberies which it states resulted in the return of thousands of pounds worth of property to its owners, the dangers to democracy and the integrity of our courts system resulting from the actions claimed to have been taken by Sinn Féin and the impact on public confidence in An Garda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the House under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely, in light of the fact that more than 4,500 polio vaccinations were administered to children between 1998 and 1999 which were out of date at the time of immunisation and after almost three months of investigation that the information remains incomplete. There is an urgent need for the Minister for Health and Children to contact immediately the parents involved, to investigate why out-of-date vaccine was administered in the first instance and <Col N="718" /> to outline to the House what checks are being put in place to ensure such an incident is not repeated.</P>

      <P>I wish to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to allow consideration of an urgent matter of public importance, namely, to hear a complete account by the Minister for Public Enterprise of the process by which the second GSM phone licence was granted to ESAT Digifone since she alone of the Ministers has complete unrestricted and untrammelled access to the file and the circumstances surrounding that decision in order to assist the Dáil and the Government Chief Whip and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and Senator Jim Gibbons in deciding whether to refer this matter to the Joint Committee&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government parties have a peculiar view of their duty as a Government and of accountability. We will continue to oppose every Order of Business until the Taoiseach comes into the House to answer questions on the resignation of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe. Will the Minister for Education and Science, as a senior and experienced member of the Cabinet, advise the Taoiseach to come into the House to make a statement and answer the question put? We will oppose the Order of Business until we get that commitment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been in office longer than many recent Administrations and it seems, as a consequence, to have lost its sense of accountability. I am sorry the Government must come into the House. I know it is a pain but it is called democracy. It took Fianna Fáil long enough to come in here in the first place and the party is still learning.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party will co-operate with the Order of Business because of the business that has been ordered and the extraordinary changes to the normal routine for Thursday on the understanding that our concern for accountability will not be dismissed and, second, and more pertinent to today's business, because we expect the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to be accommodating in regard to amendments on this issue which unites the nation so that there is co-operation and sensible amendments will be looked on in that light and treated accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business does not provide an opportunity for the Taoiseach or anyone on his behalf to correct yesterday's Dáil report when the Taoiseach told us that most EU member states had voted on the Nice Treaty. We have done some research to find that is not the case. Is the Taoiseach trying to mislead the House? Given that the Minister for Defence has not placed the partnership work programme under Partnership for Peace in the Oireachtas Library, is there a strategy to keep information from the House and to give us wrong information? An opportunity should be provided on the Order of Business to correct the record and put matters in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Today is International Women's Day and I regret very much that because of the threat of foot and mouth disease many events have been cancelled. Does the Minister for Education and Science think that a decision taken by the Minister for Finance yesterday was singularly inappropriate on the eve of International Women's Day? He appointed seven members to the Fund Reserve Commission, only one of whom is a woman. Has the Government departed from the commitment that women should comprise at least 40% of the membership of State boards or has the Minister for Finance not heard about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same topic in solidarity with the women of the world on this day, the Minister for Education and Science and I were in Cabinet together when a formal Government decision was made, noted and rigorously enforced by the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor, that women should comprise 40% of the membership of State boards. While there would have been difficulties achieving that target <Col N="722" /> in respect of casual vacancies that arose from time to time, there was absolutely no room for discretion in respect of a new board. I have no doubt the Minister recalls the persistence with which Mervyn Taylor pursued and enforced that Government decision. Was that decision formally changed? If not, has the Minister for Finance been allowed to ride roughshod over a collective decision?</P>

      <P>Have we learned nothing in recent years? I commend the Minister when on a previous occasion in relation to allegations of abuse of young vulnerable people in institutions under the care of the State he courageously ignored legal advice and allowed us look at that for which we might be collectively responsible. Why is the Minister pursuing this family and denying it rights granted by the High Court? Does the Minister agree this is not a technical appeal on a point of clarification to the Supreme Court, but a full frontal assault on the rights of a citizen of the Republic to get the same kind of education to which every other child is entitled under the Constitution? Why is the Minister doing this? Has he learned nothing?</P>

      <P>There is no concealment of anything. The issue raised by the Deputy has been a matter of public record and has been stated openly. This is a technical appeal. The appeal by the State to the Supreme Court in the case of Jamie Sinnott <i>v</i>. The Minister for Education and Science, Ireland and the Attorney General is pending and is expected to open on 27 March. It is being conducted in order to clarify points of law arising from the judgment of Mr. Justice Barr in the case, in particular whether the State's duty as regards the provision for primary education extends to such provision for adults and in effect any person. Given that the Supreme Court now has jurisdiction over this matter, Deputies will realise it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment on the issues arising in the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods:</NameTxt>
      <P>The outcome of the appeal will not affect the damages which have been paid to Jamie Sinnott and his mother. These amount to £42,000 to enable Mrs. Sinnott to put in place a home based applied behavioural analysis programme for her son. In addition, £15,000 has been paid to Mrs. Sinnott to cover expenses already incurred by her in providing an education for Jamie. Even if the Supreme Court finds that the State's duty in respect of the provision of primary education is confined to making such provision for children, the State will provide continuing education and training for Jamie Sinnott and others with similar disabilities, appropriate to their needs as adults with disabilities and in a setting appropriate for adults.</P>
      <P>The House should also know that the Government has decided to pay all costs arising from the High Court case and the Supreme Court appeal, whatever the outcome. Deputies will be aware that this is a most unusual step in such a case, but it has been taken to ensure the Sinnotts are not exposed financially in circumstances where the need to have legal certainty on important issues requires an appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that I regard it as unacceptable that any parents, particularly of a child with special needs, should find it necessary to resort to litigation to secure their children's educational entitlements. While the Government has presided over an unprecedented level of improvements in special education services, I am fully aware that much more remains to be done. Since the 1993 judgment in the O'Donoghue case a great deal has been done, and that continues. A total of 122 special classes have been established to date at a cost of more than £7 million per annum. In October 1998 the Government made a decision that the needs of children with a disability or a special need would be met, regardless of the cost. A total of 78 classes have been established since then and the number of assistants in classes has increased from 299 to 1,700 in the past two years. Therefore, there cannot be any doubt about the Government's commitment to provide services, which has been publicly questioned.</P>
      <P>In October, immediately after the Jamie Sinnott case, I announced a new package for children with autism.</P>

      <P>We have already heard how women's rights to representation are consistently being eroded by this Government. Women's rights are human rights. What is the cause of the delay in establishing the Human Rights Commission, given our obligation under the Good Friday Agreement and the apparent commitment of the Government to this legislation? Why is amending legislation not introduced as a matter of urgency so the Human Rights Commission can begin its work and hold its first meeting? Will the <Col N="731" /> Minister clarify whether amending legislation to the Human Rights Commission Act will be introduced or whether the Government will delay until the human rights convention is incorporated into Irish law? Is the Government treating this as a matter of urgency? What is causing the delay?</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. - Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 2001: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> The Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 2001 amends the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966. The information we are receiving about the foot and mouth disease in Britain is quite alarming. This underlines the fact that the battle to keep this disease out of the State must continue and, where necessary, intensify. The success of the measures we have taken to date must not be taken as any excuse for complacency.</P>
    <P>In the two weeks since we first learned of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain, thousands of people throughout this country have been engaged full time in a massive effort to ensure this country remains free of this disease. It is appropriate that I begin by paying tribute to all of those people. Long and arduous hours have been worked and much inconvenience has been tolerated, but a tremendous amount has been achieved &ndash; so far, so good.</P>
    <P>The people most directly involved have included many of my staff in the Department and members of the Garda, the Defence Forces and various State agencies. In addition, many individuals, companies and organisations have stepped forward and willingly played their part in this concerted national effort. I particularly acknowledge the role played by the various sporting and cultural bodies who, of their own volition, called off various activities at tremendous inconvenience and loss of income.</P>
    <P>While this national effort has been under way and dedicated people throughout the country have contributed to it, it has become clear that a very small and irresponsible minority has put our agri-food industry at risk for its own selfish reasons. The measures in the Bill are aimed at that minority.</P>
    <P>The provisions in this Bill will significantly enhance our ability to identify and prosecute wrong-doers, whether factories, marts, dealers, farmers or anyone else who engages in irresponsible and illegal activities. I repeat that this is a very small group and that the overwhelming majority of honest and responsible people in the industry have nothing to fear from these measures.</P>
    <P>Before I introduce the details of the Bill, I acknowledge the constructive role played by the Opposition concerning this matter, particularly by Deputy Penrose and, not for the first time in the national interest, by Deputy Dukes. I hope some day Deputy Dukes will get due reward and acknowledgement for putting the national interest first on all occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was debated in the Seanad yesterday in a very constructive fashion. I compliment the Labour Party for tabling its amendments early in the morning. Useful amendments from all sides of the House were taken on board. As regards amendments accepted in this House, arrangements have been made for the Seanad to <Col N="735" /> convene later this evening as is necessary. I will accept any constructive and worthwhile amendments.</P>
      <P>I will now outline the different sections of the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 2001 [<i>Seanad</i>]. Section 1 provides for the definition of the words and phrases used in the Bill. Most of the terms used are defined in the Diseases of Animal Act, 1966, and, therefore, do not require re-enactment.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides for the insertion of a new section in the 1966 Act. This section allows the Minister to appoint a wide range of persons to be authorised officers for the purposes of enforcing the section. The section also confers extensive powers on authorised officers. These include powers to stop persons and vehicles. They also include the power to enter any land or premises where there is a reasonable suspicion that an animal may be infected or has been in contact with an infected animal, or that an animal has been moved illegally or through a place where there may be infection. An officer may also detain and mark any animal, animal product, fodder or litter.</P>
      <P>Section 2 also gives extensive powers of search, seizure and detention in respect of vehicles, factories animals, animal products, fodder or litter. A person may also be required to produce documents and give information. This section also provides that an authorised officer, where he or she considers it reasonable, may dispose of any animal, including by slaughter, animal product, fodder or litter. This provision is not linked with compensation. There is already provision in the 1966 Act for slaughter with compensation. Slaughter without compensation would only be appropriate in rare cases. Nevertheless it is important to make this provision because taxpayers would rightly be unhappy if compensation was paid in a case where there was clear wrong-doing.</P>
      <P>The constitutional position regarding a person's residence is safeguarded by a requirement to obtain a search warrant prior to entry to a dwelling. Obstruction of an officer is made an offence for which a person may be arrested. On summary conviction, a person guilty of obstruction is liable to a fine of up to £1,500 and-or imprisonment for six months. On conviction on indictment, a person is liable to a fine of up to £100,000 and-or five years imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The powers in section 2 are very considerable but are absolutely necessary. However, I accept that Deputies may feel it desirable to review these provisions so I have provided that they will be reviewed in 12 months' time. During the intervening period we will be able to see how the provisions work and Deputies and Senators will have an opportunity to study them in more detail. The Government, therefore, introduced an amendment to the Bill in the Seanad providing for a review of this section by the Oireachtas after a period of 12 months. This was agreed by the Seanad and welcomed by all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> Section 3 inserts a new section in the Act and addresses the issue of dealers. It gives the Minister the power to approve and register dealers and their premises and to regulate their activities by order. I intend to make an order regarding this matter very quickly. We have defined a dealer as anyone who resells an animal within a period of 45 days. The original period was 100 days but the Seanad agreed that 45 days would be preferable.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the Minister may, by order, ensure that a person who purchases an animal may not move that animal for a period of 30 days. However, this section will only have effect when it is necessary to avoid an outbreak or the spread of disease.</P>
    <P>In addition, provision is made for the issue of permits to allow movement within 30 days. I intend to ensure, through the permit system, that this restriction, when in force, does not unduly interfere with normal and reasonable commercial activities, including assembly of animals for live export. Many Senators were concerned that in some regions, agents collect cattle or sheep for factories. The concern was that in small farming areas where farmers have four or five cattle, one could not have a truck taking them long distances. The permit system will allow for this situation. The details of the permit arrangements will be worked out in consultation with the relevant interests.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 are inserted on legal advice to confirm by statute the foot and mouth order of 1956 and the various orders and regulations made since the onset of the present crisis. Section 4 also provides for increased penalties for breaches of the foot and mouth disease order. The new penalties are in line with those in section 2.</P>
    <P>Section 6 and the Schedule to the Act deal with miscellaneous amendments to the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966. The main thrust of these amendments is to extend the provisions of the Act regarding areas and animals infected or suspected of being infected, to cover areas and animals at risk of infection. This is very relevant to the current situation in which we do not have a confirmed case but where we are at risk because of the situation in Britain and Northern Ireland. Some further results of blood samples, the serological tests, have been returned to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and they are clear, which is good news. Although the preliminary results which were taken from tissue were clear, the blood is left on for a much long period. As Deputies know, in France in particular, some antibodies showed up in blood samples there. Thankfully, to date, the samples referring to the Dunleer problem &ndash; the clinical veterinary examination, the serological samples, tissue samples and the virologist's examination &ndash; are all clear.</P>
    <P>There are a number of technical amendments in the Schedule which have been made on legal advice.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for an offence by a body corporate. This is an important provision. It <Col N="737" /> means that where, for example, a factory breaches the Act, or aids and abets an offence by others, the officers of that company who connive or consent to the offence, as well as the company itself, will be liable to proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 10 relates to the important issue of interference with ear tags. It allows a court to infer the illegal removal, switching or tampering of an ear-tag or, as appropriate, illegal importation of an animal, in relevant proceedings. Following amendment in the Seanad yesterday, this provision will also apply to forms of animal identification other than ear tags. Ear tags, of course, are a vital part of our control systems for cattle, and a similar system is being introduced for sheep shortly. It is therefore essential that we ensure the tightest possible legal enforcement of the rules relating to tagging. Section 11 provides for the short Title and citation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It should be clear from the foregoing that the new powers and controls introduced in this Bill are significant and that is why we have provided for a review of the most significant provisions in a year's time. However, I want to re-emphasise that these provisions are targeted at a small group of people who act in a selfish and irresponsible way in different sectors of the industry. These provisions will not be used to interfere with the normal business of factories or farmers in any way, but rather to protect them from the risks that are involved in the operations of less responsible elements. The powers in the Bill will be applied reasonably, sensibly and seriously.</P>
    <P>The stakes in the battle against foot and mouth disease are very high. The agri-food sector is of enormous importance to this country in economic terms. It accounts for 10% of our GDP and 11% of our employment. It therefore constitutes a far larger share of the economy than almost any of our EU partners. There is, of course, also an ancillary spin-off from our agri-tourist industry and a whole range of other economic activities. Recently some economists, including one from a leading stockbroking firm, said that it is not in keeping with the economic importance of the sector to have a narrow view of farming and that its regional significance should also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Even in purely economic terms the sector is more important than these basic figures suggest because of its deep internal linkages in our economy. The agri-food sector has a low import content and a high expenditure within the economy. It therefore accounts for up to 27% of our net trade earnings, when one allows for imported inputs and repatriated profits. That is an enormous share of our trade and it is this trade that could be put at risk by foot and mouth disease. It is clear that the short to medium-term impacts of a major outbreak of the disease would be considerable. There would also be long-term impacts as markets lost are not easily regained.</P>
    <P>For this reason the Government has put in place a comprehensive range of measures to guard against the disease and the damage that it <Col N="738" /> would do to the economy. The action taken was swift, decisive and well focused and the resources provided have been considerable. The measures implemented in this country go beyond those in other countries and have been implemented with a high degree of professionalism and effectiveness. We have a national control centre in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development as well as regional control centres throughout the country. I visited one of those yesterday, at Ballymascanlon. Apart from the professionalism demonstrated there, they are fine people in that part of the country &ndash; most courteous and helpful.</P>

      <P>There were some traffic inconveniences, all right, but those little sacrifices are well worth it in the end.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there has been criticism of some perceived weaknesses in our systems. In so far as these criticisms are positive and contribute to the development of our defences, I welcome them, including criticism and advice given in this House. I have endeavoured to put that advice into effect in so far as I can. I do not pretend that our systems are perfect because no system is. In the time available, however, an extraordinary amount has been achieved and we owe a great deal to those who have manned the barricades.</P>
      <P>I regret that in addition to the positive criticism, there have been some entirely negative, self-serving contributions that have, in effect, belittled the tremendous work being undertaken by those on the front line. In some instances, those criticisms have been extremely damaging to the national interest.</P>
      <P>The measures before the House will add significantly to our defences during the current crisis and will also bolster our ability to deal with any future problems. I assure Deputies that they will be implemented with the same vigour and effectiveness as the other measures we have already taken.</P>

      <P>The Minister has come before us today with a Bill which he admits contains some extraordinary powers. He also admits that it goes quite a distance in extending the reach of his officials in certain respects. He presents this as a necessary and urgent measure to deal with the serious problem we are facing. We are dealing with this emergency legislation 15 days after the first outbreak of foot and mouth disease was announced in Britain. After over two weeks of this extremely worrying threat the Minister comes before us with an emergency measure to <Col N="739" /> deal with it. That delay is symptomatic of the Government's general tardiness in dealing with the major threat facing us. The Minister's own information summary, circulated on 28 February, neatly illustrates this point. According to the summary, advice was being given for the first couple of days following the outbreak and matters were being brought to people's notice. Apart, however, from stationing a relatively small number of gardaí and army personnel on the Border at that time, nothing concrete was being done. It was quite some time later that we began to see a series of consequential measures, but all of them were taken after some considerable delay.</P>
      <P>Even from the Minister's own schedule of events, there is no indication of a co-ordinated and properly prioritised response. I will give just one example. Farmers and the general public understand that in dealing with this disease one of the most important things to control is movement &ndash; certainly the movement of animals and, desirably, the movement of people. When were movement controls instituted for animals in this jurisdiction, however? It was last Friday when the Minister first announced the movement control system in this House following the case made by the Opposition. That was a week and four days after the first outbreaks of foot and mouth disease were announced in Britain. The Minister had to ban all movements of animals and the slaughter of animals outside meat factory premises from Friday until Tuesday so that the movement control system could be put in place. That does not indicate a properly co-ordinated and prioritised approach to the problem.</P>
      <P>When this outbreak is over and the danger has passed, hopefully without our being affected, we should review the whole situation and set in place a prescription for what needs to be done in future if an outbreak is announced in the UK, or anywhere else, which poses a threat to this country. It should be possible for somebody in the Minister's Department, on hearing of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK, to take out the manual and to know from day one what arrangements have to be put in place, in what order and what resources need to be brought in from elsewhere. We should not have this tardy, cumulative response which, more by luck than judgment, has so far kept us free of the spread of this disease.</P>
      <P>All through last week and the early part of this week Deputies on the Opposition benches principally, but some on the Government side also, have recited a litany of differences between what the Minister said was being put in place and what was actually happening. We continue to hear of further instances on a daily basis. I will give a few examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was brought to my notice yesterday that there is no disinfection facility at the Dublin headquarters of the Health and Safety Authority, which has a substantial level of activity in all regions of the country. No instruction is given to officers of the Health and Safety Authority who <Col N="740" /> carry out inspections on farms when farm accidents occur, and who visit factories, including meat factories. No instruction is being given to HSA personnel on disinfection procedures which they should follow if and when they visit farms or meat factories. It was proposed that they should cut down the level of visits to farms and meat factories but that was resisted by the upper tiers of management. I have been further informed that senior managers of the HSA intend visiting the UK next week. What an example.</P>
    <P>I had a long conversation yesterday with a person who carries out a considerable amount of work for the Agricultural Contractors' Association. This person was at a point of near distraction as to how to advise farmers with regard to slurry spreading. The official advice of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is, quite correctly, that there should be no slurry spreading until further notice. Unfortunately, farm animals are unaware of that advice and they continue to produce the stuff. As slurry storage facilities on many farms are now full to the brim, further capacity needs to be provided. I know of farmers who phoned the Department's helplines for advice on this problem. In one case, a farmer was given the rather odd advice to dump the slurry in a corner of a field. Another farmer was advised to dump the slurry in the middle of a field. Even if that was physically possible, what would be the effect on the local water resources? That advice is neither helpful nor constructive.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, quite rightly, banned the importation of second hand farm machinery from the UK because of the danger of carrying infectious material. Yet agricultural contractors from north of the Border continue to work on farms south of the Border, travelling to and fro daily. That is clearly an even greater source of risk than second hand farm machinery imports.</P>
    <P>I have already referred in the House to another case, admittedly before the introduction of the movement controls, where a load of lambs for slaughter was brought from Raphoe, County Donegal, to a meat processing plant in Ballymun in north Dublin. That makes very little sense to me, especially in present circumstances. I do not know what route was followed from Raphoe to Ballymun but the shortest route is through Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, in County Roscommon, Waterways Ireland was continuing with its normal work up to 27 February. They were entering on lands, bringing mechanical diggers, tractors, trailers, lorries and other kinds of machinery to and fro across the lands and, in the process, carrying earth and mud onto the public road. When a local resident remonstrated with the foreman on site he was told that, not only would the work continue, but they intended <Col N="741" /> entering two further premises on the following Monday, 5 March.</P>
      <P>According to my information, Customs officers have not been fully involved or employed in policing the border with Northern Ireland, notwithstanding the fact that they, above all others in our public service, are the ones who know the Border and and its various crossing points most intimately. Customs officers also have the greatest experience of the stratagems adopted by people who want to get across the Border without attracting too much attention. Yet, for some reason, they have not been centrally involved in the current operation.</P>
      <P>It was brought to my attention that one Dublin citizen who visited three supermarkets in the Crumlin area yesterday found products on the shelves of two of those premises clearly labelled as having been manufactured in Newry, in one case, and in Portadown in the other case. He had understood that all such products containing meat were no longer being imported. When he phoned the Department's helpline, there was a degree of bafflement at first and then he was told that the products had been imported under special licence. Now that is news to me. I have not heard of the existence of any special licence system which can allow the importation from Northern Ireland of otherwise banned products containing meat.</P>
      <P>Since we are discussing a food issue, we should bear in mind that, as far as we know, this outbreak of disease arrived in the UK through a form of foodstuff which was subsequently fed to pigs, without having been boiled. Clearly, there is a problem with the provenance and the content of some material which is being fed to animals coming into this country and into the European Union. There is no system in place for ensuring the traceability of animal feedstuffs used generally in the European Union. Consequently, there is a risk, quite how serious I do not know, that some of the more exotic imported feedstuffs could carry infection of which we are unaware at time of import. Crucially, in the event of a subsequent outbreak of disease, we would be unable to trace the infectious feedstuff back to its origin. I urge the Minister to take up that issue at the earliest possible time. It is a matter of concern for the EU generally. As the Minister knows, there are quite substantial imports of feedstuffs into the EU of far flung origins. Indeed, the EU also imports substantial quantities of food for human consumption from various exotic locations where we cannot be confident that food quality checks are up to our standards. For example, the case of Thai chickens immediately springs to mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, we have managed to escape the animal health manifestations of this disease but other problems exist. Substantial numbers of staff have been laid off by meat factories and we are now beginning to see the ripple effect this crisis is having in many other industries. For example, suppliers to meat factories, leisure activities and the service industry have all been affected. I <Col N="742" /> know the Minister has no control over these developments, which are an inevitable result of the kinds of measures we are obliged to take, but they show how important it is that Ireland remains free of this disease and that we continue to insist that the UK authorities take a more rigorous approach than they have done heretofore.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for providing Opposition spokespersons with the opportunity yesterday to meet some of the staff who have been involved in the preparation of the Bill. We had a useful discussion which, I believe, proved to be mutually beneficial because both sides gained something out of it and the Bill has been improved as a result.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for rather extraordinary powers for authorised officers. It makes obstruction of an officer an offence, empowers the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to register dealers, provides for the forfeiture of vehicles, vessels, containers and, in some circumstances, even factories and premises and provides that a court may permanently ban a person or a company from involvement in an agriculture related activity. The Government wants to deal with these matters in a day long debate. That is quite a demand. I am delighted the Minister has taken on board one of the suggestions we made yesterday and that he is now proposing that the legislation will have a limited life. I must confess, however, I have not seen the provision he has made in that regard.</P>
    <P>I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage which will provide that the Act shall lapse on a specified date and that its provisions will continue to be enforced only with the further approval of the Oireachtas. The length of the period during which the legislation should remain in force that I intend to put forward is considerably shorter than that advocated by the Minister. However, we can discuss that matter on Committee Stage. Given the extraordinary extent of the powers included in the Bill, it would be essential &ndash; if I can use an analogy &ndash; that we be able to review in &ldquo;peacetime&rdquo; measures we have taken in &ldquo;wartime&rdquo; in order to consider how they worked, whether they were necessary and whether further changes are required.</P>
    <P>I have stated on previous occasions when emergency legislation was introduced in the House that this is a bad way to legislate. Emergency legislation dealt with in this manner often proves to be bad legislation. I can recall only two instances in the 20 years I have been a Member of the House when emergency legislation proved to be effective and stood the test of time. The first instance to which I refer was the introduction, by the late Deputy Frank Cluskey, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, of an emergency Bill to deal with the PMPA and the second was the introduction by my party Leader, Deputy Noonan &ndash; as Minister for Justice &ndash; a measure to confiscate funds owned by the IRA. Both measures worked.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> Other emergency legislation introduced in the House subsequently proved to be completely useless. For example, a measure on bail was introduced by the zero tolerance Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, the provisions of which, as far as I am aware, have never been used in a court. On introducing this measure, the Minister, who was fired up with missionary zeal, stated that it was absolutely necessary to protect Irish people from the crooks and criminals that Sinn Féin is claiming to be dealing with. The measure in question made no difference.</P>
    <P>Emergency legislation must always be a last resort. It applies to the law a principle I urged on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to apply to animals, namely, shoot first and ask questions later. That principle is right for animals but it is not right for the law. The Minister made the case that we need the legislation before us on the implicit basis that we had no proper contingency plan to put into effect when this crisis arose.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a brief reference to one of the provisions in the Bill which involves dealers. The Minister, like all other Members, will be aware that this has caused a great deal of consternation among a group of people, the vast majority of whom are essential to our agricultural trading system and without whom farmers would find it much more difficult to do their job. I accept, however, that included in their ranks are a number of bad eggs. These people have been referred to as &ldquo;rogue traders&rdquo;. I received a communication earlier today from a person with an interest in traders who made the point that the Bill is meant to put an end to rogue traders. However, he also pointed out that in recent years at least one Taoiseach, various Ministers, Senators, bishops, priests, brothers, captains of industry and many others have been proven to be rogues in far more serious affairs than those involving cattle dealers. The person further stated that no legislation has been introduced to seriously impair the livelihoods of those to whom he refers and highlights the fact that none of them has been brought to justice. That is fair comment.</P>
    <P>The greatest confusion in respect of the Bill relates to the provision on the retention of animals for a period of 30 days. I have been able to set people's minds at rest in that regard by explaining that this period will only apply when there is a declaration, under an order made by the Minister, that a disease is present or that there is a risk that there could be an outbreak. I look forward to considering these matters further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government should apologise to Members for, again, bringing forward a measure of this kind which has to be dealt with in such a hurried manner. I hope the Minister will agree, when we reach Committee Stage, that the 12 month period after which it is proposed to review the legislation is excessive in the circumstances and that a shorter period is <Col N="744" /> required, particularly in light of the powers being conferred under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill. I thank the Minister and his officials for the courteous way they discussed the legislation with us yesterday. Those discussions were of mutual benefit to everyone involved and I am glad that some of the amendments we debated later became incorporated in Government amendments which were furnished later. The Minister will appreciate that the Labour Party has put forward a number of constructive amendments and, hopefully, he will see the merit in them. Being a lawyer I tend to consider matters from a legal point of view and I do not blame the officials for not taking on board everything we say.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that there is an urgent need for this legislation. However, that is not a justification for not getting it right. The Oireachtas does its job properly when it subjects Bills introduced in circumstances of this nature to particularly rigorous scrutiny. My party has a number of concerns which I intend to express.</P>
      <P>During Question Time on Tuesday of last week I asked about the emergency measures it was planned to introduce. Indeed, I was one of the first people to inquire about restrictions on the movement of animals and humans. I did so because it was important that clear signals were sent out and a good example shown. That is very important.</P>
      <P>The outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain triggered a tremendous degree of apprehension, fear and anxiety throughout the Republic with many thousands of people engaging in a massive effort to ensure this country remains free of the disease. We have seen the tremendous effort by staff of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the members of the Garda Síochána, many of whom worked in extremely difficult and unpleasant conditions. The Defence Forces and the Civil Defence also played a pivotal role in this concerted effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard some people pontificating about this problem on various programmes but the importance of the agri-food sector cannot be over-emphasised. Despite a decline in importance, this sector remains the bedrock of activity in rural Ireland but certain type of talk could lead people to drop their guard and become complacent in relation to the problem. There is no room for complacency in this battle against foot and mouth disease. The measures put in place yesterday have <Col N="745" /> to be treated with the same fortress-like mentality tomorrow as they were treated yesterday.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said earlier, the importance of the agri-food industry is enormous. It amounts to 10% of GDP, 11% of employment, over a quarter of our net foreign trade earnings, it is worth up to £10 billion, with £5 billion accruing directly from animals, etc. It penetrates all sectors of our economy and has a major unifying effect on urban and rural Ireland. There is often a perceived divide but the reaction of all people throughout urban and rural areas indicates that is not the case.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I want to send our best wishes to two members of the Garda Síochána who were injured in the course of their duties on the Border. There was also a magnificent effort by thousands of individuals, companies and organisations who have all played heroic roles in a united and concerted national effort. They realised they were doing that in the national interest. I salute the efforts and the responsibility exhibited by all the community, voluntary, sporting and cultural organisations. The unselfish decisions and sacrifices they made resulted in significant disruption, inconvenience and financial loss to many of those whose activities have an international dimension.</P>
    <P>It is a pity some of the commercial organisations, for example those involved in the promotion of large concerts, music or other events where large numbers congregate and who derive significant commercial and financial benefit, did not follow suit and respond positively to the appeals of the Government not to proceed with such events. It is shoulder to the wheel time for everybody. There has to be a united effort by everybody. Example must be all-pervasive. There should be no half measures and the Minister should direct the commercial organisation involved not to permit such concerts wherever they are to be held. He should ask for these to be deferred. They can be re-scheduled so as not to disappoint the many thousands of young people who obviously enjoy musical and cultural events. Let us be clear about that. We are not killjoys or spoilsports. We all realise that people enjoy these events and derive entertainment from them.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the decision of some of our jockeys, and I see Deputy McGahon in the House, to go to Cheltenham.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but he is a supporter of the racing industry. I made my views known on the way the British authorities have reacted to this crisis, and I will say no more about that. When an outbreak of disease threatens the livelihood of so many, we should have in place an emergency response plan. For the first few days of this crisis we have been dusting down the 1967 plan and putting it in place but there has been major fundamental change in this country since that time. That is self-evident. There is no foot and mouth disease in Canada or Mexico and between 6 and <Col N="746" /> 8 November 2000 they carried out a simulated exercise involving vaccines, etc. that could be used. That exercise allowed them to put in place a comprehensive emergency plan, as individual countries, but also on a co-ordinated regional basis. That is what we should be looking at so that if this ever happens again, we will know what to do and we can immediately spring into action. That should be done in conjunction with Britain because that is the nearest place an outbreak is likely to occur. That is important.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with a number of issues in the Bill, I want to make an appeal. Sheep farmers are suffering significantly and they have contacted me in the past few days. They need advance payments of subsidies, and I believe the Minister will accept that. Finances are getting extremely tight for them. They have significant outlays, credit titles, etc. Deputy Dukes referred to some of those farmers and cattle farmers for whom slurry is now becoming a major problem. I had a telephone call last night from some people in Deputy McGahon's part of the country where slurry is becoming a major problem. People are trying to comply but they have nowhere to go. Animals are being kept in longer, the cost of feedstuffs is increasing and it is time for ploughing. Many farmers want to plough but they are being prevented from doing it. It is time to get the seed into the ground and get the crops growing. I hope the Minister, particularly in the exclusion zone area which Deputy McGahon represents, will address that problem. I understand the people from there will meet his officials today and I hope they will look favourably on their concerns.</P>
      <P>This is also a time for cool heads. We must not become complacent but we have to encourage the fortress mentality because one slip up could be fatal and that would cost us dearly in terms of huge losses. We have to look across the economy. There is a £500 million loss to the tourism industry, as my colleague, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, explained. Approximately 22,000 or 23,000 jobs are at risk in that area. About 600 conferences have been cancelled so there is a knock-on effect on all sectors of the economy.</P>
      <P>Perhaps this crisis will help us realise that the Celtic tiger does not have such a solid foundation. We have been lulled into a false sense of security in that regard. It had almost become a national badge of bravado that we were untouchable, yet over the past fortnight we have teetered on the brink and fought an all-out rearguard effort to ensure this crisis does not knock us off course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger that people will confuse foot and mouth disease with BSE and CJD; I heard the Minister refer to that also. People seem to think that foot and mouth disease affects food safety but it does not. It is a serious disease which poses a national threat and obviously threatens our world trade in food on which we rely to such a great extent. The Minister should re-emphasise the point that foot and mouth disease has nothing to do with food safety and that animals actually <Col N="747" /> recover from the disease after a few weeks. The problem is that the disease is so contagious.</P>
    <P>As a lawyer I detest emergency legislation because in the past, as Deputy Dukes said, it invariably proved not to be the best legislation. The time limit for review is important. Laws passed in the heat of the moment do not receive the scrutiny which legislation demands and deserves. We have to revisit it with cooler heads and a more reflective attitude. There are measures which are draconian in nature, such as search and seizure, etc. We should be able to revisit this legislation in less frantic circumstances. The problem might look different in hindsight six months or so from now. It is important, therefore, that any proposal to extend this legislation will be subject to the further scrutiny and agreement of the Houses of the Oireachtas and hopefully all of the problems encountered will be solved and we will be in a position to effect appropriate improvements if they are required.</P>
    <P>A number of organisations have expressed concerns. The 30 days referred to in section 3(3) is reasonably necessary but it should be applied only in exceptional circumstances and not in the normal occurrences where outbreaks of disease occur. Orders brought in could become an impediment to normal trade.</P>
    <P>Most people involved in trade adhere to the rules and regulations. Only a few, as the Minister said, flout them. They threaten the existence of the industry and must be rooted out. If it was to become the norm certainly the calf or weanling trade would be affected.</P>
    <P>If under section 3(5) the Minister must bring in an order to restrict movement for 30 days, it is important that permits are made available quickly. Many dealers conduct their business legitimately, strictly adhering to the guidelines and regulations. Is it the intention to issue permits to recognised dealers in advance, at least for calves and weanlings, because permitting each animal would lead to an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare? That should not be the case. One can accept that under the current circumstances, with the foot and mouth threat, nothing should move, but we must keep it in perspective otherwise this could be a major problem.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 2, we want to insert a new subsection which reads:</P>
    <P>(9) Any information given by a person pursuant to a request or requirement under subsection (8) shall not be admissible in criminal proceedings against that person (other than proceedings under subsection (14)(<i>c</i>)(i)).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This protects the right against self incrimination. I note what the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, stated yesterday that the Government took cognisance of the Supreme Court ruling in the NIB case with regard to self-incrimination. However, without this amendment the section is unconstitutional and contrary to the European Conven<Col N="748" /> tion. This is important and we want to help the Minister. I accept that the Minister is advised that it is unnecessary and that it is already governed by fundamental law, for example the NIB case. We cannot be casual about the protection of fundamental rights. We want express protection of the right not to incriminate oneself.</P>
    <P>Section 2, inserts a new section 17A and we propose in page 5, line 41 after &ldquo;liable&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in damages&rdquo;. I understand what was said yesterday, but we seek to retain the right to sue officers for illegality by way of judicial review. It is an administrative decision that the authorised officer is making and that should be subject to judicial review. We want a review after 6 months, not the 12 months proposed.</P>
    <P>We propose under section 3(6) that &ldquo;An appeal shall lie against a refusal of an application for a permit under subsection (5) to such officer as may be designated in that behalf by the Minister having regard to any provision in the general law regarding agriculture appeals.&rdquo; If the Minister accepts that, there will be an appeals system. The Minister appeared to accept it, but it is not in the Bill which is where we want to see it.</P>
    <P>I refer to Section 2 and to the slaughter of animals without compensation. Section 2 inserts a new section as section 17A of the 1996 Act. The existing section refers to the slaughter of diseased animals and compensation. The new section 17A confers powers on the Minister's authorised officers, including the power to require the disposal of animals without provision for compensation. The Minister of State's Second Stage speech in the Seanad makes it clear that this omission is deliberate. He said:</P>
    <P>This section also provides that an authorised officer, where he considers it  reasonable, may dispose of any animal, including by slaughter, or any animal  product, fodder or litter. This provision is not linked with compensation. There is  already provision in the Act for slaughter with compensation. Slaughter without  compensation would only be appropriate in rare cases. It is important to make this provision because taxpayers would rightly be very unhappy if compensation was paid in a case where there was clear wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>No one wants to see anyone who purposely attempts to distort or falsify results of tests benefiting from compensation. We support that. Compensation was introduced to cover the impact of disease introduced into a herd innocently leaving a farmer denuded of his working capital, the livestock.</P>
    <P>The Bill as it stands means there will be two provisions on the statute book dealing with the power to require the slaughter of animals. One will specify that compensation payable and the other will not. This Bill does not specify the circumstances under which it would be considered appropriate to require the slaughter of animals without provision for compensation. The Minister intends to refuse compensation where there is <Col N="749" /> clear wrongdoing. This involves a finding by an administrative officer rather than a court, that an individual acted in breach of the law and committed a criminal offence. Also, it entails the attachment by that officer, rather than a court, of a penalty for the offence, that is, the refusal of compensation for the destruction of his property.</P>
    <P>I understand why the Minister did not set out in the Bill the precise circumstances in which the authorised officer would be entitled to require the slaughter of animals without provision for compensation. If he did, the provisions would be liable to be struck down as unconstitutional on the grounds that they involve the administration of justice in a criminal matter other than by a judge. However, the failure to set out in the statutory scheme the circumstances in which one route should be chosen rather than another, in other words, whether to compensate or not, still leaves the scheme open to constitutional challenge on the grounds that the making of such a choice with the resulting consequences for the rights of the persons affected is in itself an administration of justice which should be confined to the courts.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister and his legal advisers, some of whom I know well, to consider whether the refusal of compensation for slaughter of animals on the grounds of wrongdoing by the owner should be a power that should not be confined to a court which has heard and considered the evidence. In any event the Minister failed to point out that the 1966 Act already makes the provision in section 58. It is significant in this context that the power of forfeiture of vehicles, vessels, aircraft or containers in section 7 of the Bill can only be exercised by way of a court order subsequent to conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>I seek to help the Minister. There is a prohibition on retroactive penal legislation. Article 15.5 of the Constitution provides &ldquo;that the Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be an infringement of the law which were not so at the date of the commission.&rdquo; The Supreme Court Case, Doyle <i>versus</i> An Taoiseach, 1986, ILRM 693, dealt with section 79 of the Finance Act, 1980, which purported to confirm the validity of certain levies made by statutory instrument the previous year. The Supreme Court held that if the provisions of the section were intended to have retrospective effect they would to that extent be unconstitutional since the result would be <i>ex post facto</i> to make non-payment of the levy an infringement of the law. To save the section from unconstitutionality, it had to be interpreted as having only prospective effect. Applying that judgment to this Bill, it seems that section 4(1) is safe as it confirms the foot and mouth disease order, 1956 and that can be interpreted as having prospective effect only. However, section 5 provides that the following are confirmed as and from the date on which they purported to come into operation, and all the Minister's recent orders to deal with the present crisis are listed. The wording of the section &ldquo;the date upon which they purported to come into operation&rdquo; is an implicit admission that the <Col N="750" /> orders at present are invalid since the 1966 Act does not cover animals at risk of infection as opposed to those suspected of being infected.</P>
    <P>Yet the Minister's wording states that those orders should be confirmed as and from the date upon which they purported to come into operation, in other words, we are asked to validate them today and give them retrospective effect. As there are criminal sanctions for breach of the orders, we are asked to do precisely what Article 15.5 of the Constitution prohibits us from doing. That is why we proposed in the Seanad and propose today in this House the deletion of the words &ldquo;as and from the date upon which they purported to come into operation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 2001, is before us because of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom on 20 February. This deadly and highly contagious disease could have serious effects if a case shows up here. The regulations in this Bill upgrade the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, to ensure that any future disease control measures are in place if necessary. Parts of this Bill have been referred to as draconian and tough but Governments and Ministers are there to ensure the benefit of the vast majority. Future rogue traders will not have the opportunity to jeopardise an entire industry, in this case the agriculture industry, and thereby put the entire economy at risk. Certain regulations have caused concern, and I accept that emergency legislation can sometimes make bad law. It is now the Oireachtas' turn to put this Bill in place having implored people to take the issue seriously for the last ten days.</P>
      <P>Various changes have been made to agriculture regulations during the last few years. As public representatives, we often encounter a belief that the agriculture industry has had more regulations than any other industry. The last ten days have shown that these regulations are for the betterment and benefit of agriculture. While a lot of paperwork and red tape are involved, the measures exist for the protection of farmers' livelihoods and of the industry as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was great opposition to the tagging of sheep last September or October. If it was said last Wednesday or Thursday night that to tag every sheep in the country before daybreak was the only way to keep foot and mouth disease out, I have no doubt but that it would have been done. <Col N="751" /> People were so scared that any measure would have been accepted to ensure that it was kept out.</P>
    <P>Coming from an agricultural background I can say that agriculture and agri-business comprised the original Celtic tiger. Over many decades, agriculture was the main source of income, particularly in rural Ireland. It helped people to rear and to educate families. Many people who live in cities like Dublin or Cork have a first or second generation agricultural background. The measures that are being put in place today are designed to protect that industrial heritage.</P>
    <P>Foot and mouth disease is rampant within the United Kingdom. Although we have very strict regulations in place, I wonder if the British authorities are taking this matter as seriously as they should. It is frightening that 15 cases were confirmed yesterday. However, I hope we do not become complacent and that we remain vigilant.</P>

      <P>The last week has been very difficult for farmers and for everyone. The confirmation on Wednesday evening last of an outbreak in south Armagh sent shock waves through the agriculture and food producing industries. The actions of a few individuals placed an industry worth £9 billion in danger and the nation's future at risk for a small short-term gain. I compliment the Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, including the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, for their immediate and effective response to the foot and mouth outbreak in Britain. True political leadership at a time of great crisis was shown.</P>
      <P>Those who listened to Deputy Dukes would have the impression that foot and mouth disease has occurred here and not in the United Kingdom, where it is rampant. I was saddened by the Deputy's attempts to turn this into a political football.</P>

      <P>Officials at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Garda Síochána, the Army and many others worked in difficult weather conditions at the Border, airports and ports to keep this terrible scourge out. It was wonderful to see the enormous efforts of people across the country, particularly those in the agricultural sector who volun<Col N="752" /> tarily manned disinfectant points. I commend voluntary organisations for their immediate response which stopped the movement of vast numbers of people.</P>
      <P>While we are thankfully free from foot and mouth disease, we cannot let our guard down as the disease is rampant in England with over 90 cases confirmed to date. We must continue on high alert and take every possible precaution. I welcome the cancellation of events due to take place during the next couple of weeks. The spread of this disease in Britain is a major cause for concern, and I wonder if the authorities there are taking the out-of-control situation seriously.</P>
      <P>The Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill, 2001, will impose controls on the movement of animals and reduce the activities which threatened the survival of the industry last week. All animal sectors must have strict disease control measures and traceability procedures. Irish farmers have built up an excellent system of farming which produces quality food products in a clean, green environment. The great work of many has been damaged on many occasions by the roguish actions of a few, but this Bill will put a stop to that. The imposition of a £100,000 fine and a one year jail sentence will show the seriousness of the offence. The tagging of sheep during the next six months will ensure traceability. The fact that all animals must be maintained for 30 days unless under special permit, will reduce the spread of disease.</P>
      <P>This Bill also deals with the highly dangerous offence of illegally switching or tampering with ear tags. It gives the courts the ultimate power of sanction to remove an individual from farming or agricultural activity. I urge the House to support the emergency passage of this legislation to provide a proper and effective disease control system. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and his Department on the effective measures they have put in place to ensure Ireland retains its disease free status. Yesterday we saw the success of a new foot and mouth livestock movement control as more than 100 meat plants and abattoirs complied with the issue of over 1,000 movement permits. They, along with farmers, Teagasc, ICOs and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, are to be complimented for keeping our country free from the disease.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That two gardaí were injured while carrying out duties on the Border is an indication of the types of people with which our security forces must deal. As other speakers have done, I wish <Col N="753" /> to convey my best wishes to the injured gardaí and my thanks to everyone who helps to secure the Border.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to some anomalies. One relates to my area where on Friday afternoon the Minister announced that all marts in the Border areas were to close. It was a request, not an order. How many telephone calls were made to the press corps before a press conference was organised to get that information across to people? Calls to the five district veterinary officers in the Border region would have ensured the marts and all other relevant personnel would know exactly what the Department had in mind.</P>
    <P>Most dealers are decent people, and the 30 day provision in this legislation will have major implications for them. The Department has rightly curtailed the number of herd numbers any family may have, especially if a dealership is involved. However, there should be a proper penal system so that innocent family members are not brought along with an individual who has been involved in wrongdoing and put out of business. We must be very careful about this. I have witnessed abuse of powers under current legislation in respect of reasonably innocent persons. I do not condone wrongdoing, but there are degrees of wrongdoing, and some families were subjected to the rigours of the law in ways that others were not. I hope this legislation is implemented as the Minister said it would be, that it will be targeted at a small group of people, and the powers under it applied reasonably and sensibly. There are crooks who deserve to be subjected to the full rigours of the law, and want the law used against them. However, I do not want to see innocent people being victimised just to prove that officialdom is doing its job. There needs to be a guarantee that appeals will be possible.</P>
    <P>The issue of compensation for slaughtered animals must be looked at as well, given that one case with which I had to deal was not looked at fairly, and no law had yet been implemented. The question of tagging must also be looked at. There is nothing in this Bill in relation to factories or Department officials who may not have been complying properly with the law in the past. The 8,000 sheep that got around the system in recent years, which we read about in the newspapers yesterday, could not have done so without some degree of knowledge on the part of factory personnel and Department officials. That whole issue needs to be looked at. The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, has clearly stated that the whole issue of sheep tagging was ignored by farm organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Walsh, has been less explicit. There are two final issues I want to raise. Could small farmers not be allowed to bring cattle to selected points where they could be picked up by one lorry and brought the longer distances to meat factories? On the <Col N="754" /> question of slurry, the Minister of State, when he was on this side of the House said he would guarantee that all markets would be kept open regardless of BSE or anything else. There is an onus on him now to ensure markets are kept as open as possible and that farmers get reasonable prices for their livestock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very short time at my disposal I will deal only with a number of points in the Bill about which I am extremely worried. The Bill is necessary and nobody would oppose its main thrust. The image of farmers and their noble profession has been besmirched by the misdemeanours of a few who have managed to almost sabotage the industry. Rogue farmers, rogue agents, rogue dealers, rogue meat processors and some very sloppy administration have ensured the agricultural industry has got its share of negative publicity in the past few years. There have been controversies about angel dust, BSE, TB and brucellosis, and now foot and mouth disease. I hope we will not get that dreaded disease.</P>
      <P>Before detailing what is wrong with the Bill, let me make it clear that I want the wrongdoers crowned with thorns and I want to get them out, but caution is needed. The majority of farmers, agents and dealers do a decent job. Many commit a lifetime to their duties and make a vital contribution to the national economy. However, the definition of dealers in the Bill is neither sensible nor reasonable, but I understand that is being changed &ndash; I had a chat with the officials yesterday morning, which I found very useful. If the provision for 100 days were left as it is, it would mean there would be 30,000 cattle dealers, because people buy and sell stock, store lambs and so on, inside 30 days. I do not have the time to go into detail now, but it would be a disaster, and it will have to be curtailed.</P>
      <P>We need to be careful about the powers being given to authorised officers. I consider that to be extremely dangerous, although necessary in some parts of the country. There should be a time limit. We will talk more about that later.</P>
      <P>The section on how agents and dealers are to be handled will have the most profound effect of all. The livestock industry is like a big jigsaw. Every component part of it is very important to the overall industry. Most livestock agents do a good job. I fully subscribe to and have held the view for a long time that they should be licensed, and they accept that. However, that begs some questions. Historically it has been the practice for, say a farmer in County Galway to buy in calves from the south, and we might like to chance that practice. Will such a dealer now be allowed to buy the calves in the south and bring them for sale at a mart in Tuam? That is a very specific question. If a feeder initially wants 2,000 cattle of a certain type at a certain time, will agents be able to work all around the country and assemble the cattle for export? </P>

What happens here today may not be interpreted as such at local level when those people are asked to do A, B, X or Y. I will go into this point in much greater detail on Committee Stage.

      <P>I am surprised my constituency colleague, Deputy Crawford, did not see the merit in the Department calling a press conference on that Friday evening. It was of the utmost importance to inform the public of the dangers facing the country from this dreaded, contagious disease. The Department should make no apology for calling press conferences to get a message across to people.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the local media, particularly the broadcast and printed media, on its campaign to ensure people were made aware of the difficulties facing them and giving general information on where products could be sourced, etc. I hope next week the Department will buy advertising space in local newspapers, particularly in the farming sections, to ensure the farming community understands the new measures which will be implemented under the legislation. As the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, have repeatedly stated, we need to remind people that we cannot be complacent and there is an absolute need for diligence and vigilance in the implementation of measures to ensure this jurisdiction is kept free of this desperate disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, the Minister of State, their officials both at headquarters level in Dublin and at local level, the Garda, Army and voluntary organisations on the tremendous efforts they have made to ensure the State is kept free of foot and mouth disease. Officials in my constituency have worked night and day manning remote checkpoints along the Border. As the Taoiseach said last week, it is difficult to police a 253 mile border on an ongoing basis. I compliment all those officials. I also commend the many voluntary organisations and those commercial bodies which put the interests of the country first and cancelled events. I fully endorse Deputy Penrose's call to other selfish commercial <Col N="756" /> interests which have not shown leadership to cancel events.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that the country remains on full alert until 30 days after the last outbreak of the disease in Britain. I have raised with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development the concerns expressed to me by constituents about the lax attitude adopted to this issue on the northern side of the Border. People who had to travel to the North last week told me that on the southern side of the Border the manning of checkpoints was exemplary, whereas there was a complete laxity on the northern side. This is not acceptable and I hope the Minister, in his ongoing consultations with Minister Bríd Rodgers, and the Taoiseach, in his communications with Mr. Blair, will reinforce this point and our concerns. I also compliment Teagasc, ICOS and the farming organisations which sent literature to the farming community and placed advertisements in local papers to make people aware and to give useful pointers to the farming community.</P>
    <P>The additional measures being put through the House will tackle effectively the wrongdoing by a small minority engaged in farming and livestock dealing. These measures will be welcomed by the overwhelming majority of the farming community who are not prepared to put up with the possible destruction of the major national industry by the reckless behaviour of a small number who are out to make quick money in a dishonest manner. People who flout the law of the land and the regulations established by the Department, be it at farm gate level, dealer level or in factories, must be made to pay a severe price. This necessary legislation will make a difference.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Bill is aimed at a minority of farmers, dealers and unscrupulous factories. I am glad he referred to the powers provided for under section 9 which deals with an offence by a body corporate. This is an important provision. Every factory should know the source of the product it purchases and processes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation which is clearly directed at the correct areas and will ensure that everything possible is done to combat the threat of foot and mouth disease in this jurisdiction. It is only fair to commend those sporting bodies, members of the public, departmental officials, Garda, Army and other people not directly involved in agriculture on the tremendous lengths they have gone to in ensuring the national interest is protected. A majority of people have shown exemplary behaviour across many sectors. This tough legislation is warranted in the circumstances and is directed at the correct areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable consumer confusion, which is a cause of concern. It does not come within the remit of the legislation but there seems to be a high degree of confusion between the effects of BSE and CJD in terms of the human food chain, on the one hand, and the effects of <Col N="757" /> foot and mouth, on the other. I do not know how this can be addressed but there is a need for a marketing programme to ensure the confusion which has arisen is addressed in so far as that is possible. There is concern among those in trade union circles about employees in the meat processing industry who are in danger of losing their jobs, more directly because of consumer perceptions rather than because of any inherent threats. There is also concern in the tourism sector. Hoteliers have told me they are losing between 30-80% of their business.</P>
    <P>One of the enormous advantages of the legislation is that it is directed exactly at those areas where there is cause for concern. Some people may have gone too far in terms of their reaction and common sense needs to prevail. This aspect must be looked at in the coming weeks. However, it is difficult to do this in the face of the cavalier attitude of the UK authorities generally and their failure to face up to the foot and mouth crisis in their jurisdiction. It is fair to expect them, as neighbours, to have consideration for everyone else. Yet they have not even managed to move themselves to the stage of being concerned about their industry. More than anything else, this has to be a cause for concern.</P>
    <P>Some of the concerns expressed about the long-term effects of the legislation and the consequences of not setting a time limit are well founded. The majority of farmers and traders have complied with the law and have behaved in a proper manner. The legislation must be directed at those who have flouted the law &ndash; some of them have flouted it over many years. These people should not be given any protection and should suffer the full rigours of the law. Even though the legislation is being introduced during a crisis it is correct that it should be introduced in these circumstances. I do not share the concern that the legislation goes too far. In many respects, it is the minimum which could and should be done to address those people in the community who have behaved in a disgraceful manner and who apparently intend to continue in this manner. The test of the legislation will be the manner in which it addresses these people and their activities.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a matter which is of concern in my own area, namely, the herds of feral goats in the Burren. I have raised this matter with the Minister and with Dúchas. I understand there are about 1,000 of these wild goats mainly in the Burren National Park. They roam widely through the countryside, do enormous damage to fences and cause trouble for farmers in relation to REPS. I am concerned that little is known about the health status of these animals and little effort has been made to establish it. It is grossly unfair that they should roam over half a county uncontrolled and that Dúchas, which takes enormous interest in the activities of farmers who may have the misfortune to move a bush or do something minor of that nature, have taken much less interest in this area.</P>

I draw to the attention of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or an appropriate body that a herd of feral goats is roaming the Sliabh Bloom mountain area in Laoighis-Offaly without restriction.</P>
      <P>This particular strain of foot and mouth disease which has caused the present crisis is virulent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Finucane. There is evidence that the disease is spread almost exclusively by animal to animal contact. This is the evidence from the British and Armagh outbreaks. If susceptible animals are not moved from farm to farm and if only moved, under licence, directly to an abattoir, the disease will be prevented from entering the State. If an outbreak occurs it will only be contained and eliminated by controlling the movement of animals. To ensure compliance with the new movement of animals order there should be random, day and night, checkpoints by the Garda, departmental officials, and, if necessary, the Army. This is an issue on which there has been little discussion. The random checkpoint in the exclusion area is important. I compliment the Garda, the Army and the departmental officials. Annual leave for the Garda and the Army should be cancelled if that has not been done.</P>
      <P>That lambs have travelled from Armagh to Athleague indicates that illegal activity is often carried out at night. If an outbreak occurs and an exclusion zone is necessary around a particular farm, it is critical that that zone be rigidly controlled. That is where the random checkpoint comes in. It is clear there has been a flouting of regulations. The cosy nod and wink relationship between some officials of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the meat factories must be addressed. It is clear there has been significant smuggling of sheep and lambs for some time from Britain through Northern Ireland into the Republic. These animals then acquire a new identity and are passed off as Irish. This illegal importation has been going on for years and is designed to undermine and depress the price paid to local farmers. It appears the Department has no effective policy in place to prevent this smuggling. The lack of effective action by the Department can only lead to the conclusion that the Minister is not concerned about this issue. Clear instructions must be given to Department vets at meat plants, the fraud squad and the Criminal Assets Bureau to stamp out the illegal trafficking of livestock. It appears that the Department and the Minister have learned nothing from the beef tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter of concern is the one island veterinary regime. The report of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body did not reach a conclusion <Col N="759" /> on the issue. However, it forms the basis of a programme of action that would be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>I fully support the tagging of sheep to facilitate tracing and help prevent smuggling. In the animal welfare and animal health area it is clear animals are being moved long distances in crowded conditions with a view to taking advantage of regional price variations. This is contrary to good animal welfare. Such movement causes severe distress to animals and contributes to the spread of disease and it should be controlled.</P>
    <P>The inherent risk to animal health in the operation of livestock marts should be examined. The continuing failure to eradicate TB which is largely spread by animal to animal contact is important in this regard. The time has come for co-operatives, marts, farmers and the Department to consider new ways of creating a fair market in livestock which does not include the bringing together of large numbers of animals.</P>
    <P>From a consumer point of view it is important that the local butcher is supported. Meat bought from the local butcher is more likely to be home produced and more likely to be traceable. The big supermarkets are likely to source their food from the cheapest source in the world. There are opportunities for local butchers and farmers to co-operate in alliances to guarantee the origins of their product and so gain market share. The local abattoir has a role to play in this and consideration should be given to the introduction of some form of aid to ensure the existence of the local abattoirs.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to the crisis is too little, too late. The Government is tired and sluggish and has been in office far too long. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, has been in office for l2 of the past 15 years. This crisis has shown it is time for change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that it took a foot and mouth disease crisis to introduce many of these changes which are positive. In regard to the Bill, much concern has been expressed by many people involved in dealing. Many of the regulations are factored in for emergencies and there is a perception that they will apply <i>ad infinitum. </i>Questions have been asked which the Department must answer. It is significant that there has been criticism of the large scale smuggling which has continued for some time. It appears there was collusion with some of the factories in this large scale smuggling. That is a cause of concern. It is interesting to note there was a resistance to the introduction of sheep tagging. It has taken a crisis of this magnitude to pressurise people into making decisions in this area. I welcome the positive direction it has taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to focus on poultry because I come from an area where it is a significant player in employment. I am impressed with the level of quality assurance which exists in that industry. The multiples have a role to play because they undertake <Col N="760" /> quality assurance checks not only in factory units but in the broiler units to ensure quality from farm to fork. There is some concern regarding poultry imports particularly from non-EU countries and from Thailand. Recently a group of MPs visited the Thai operation to see the production methods used and some questions were asked. How can the Department be satisfied at the level of imports given that Asian swill precipitated the foot and mouth disease? What veterinary controls exist here to ensure that the quality of poultry imports not only from EU countries but non-EU countries is up to standard? I think there are serious questions to be answered. I am well aware of the controls that operate in the poultry industry in Castlemahon, Kerry Foods and Cappoquin Chickens and the competition they have to face in the open market. In the recent past a significant achievement was compensation for those involved in the industry in the broiler units and the hatcheries. Is there scope in this area for the Department, especially when the concerns on the foot and mouth side are factored in, to strengthen its controls on poultry imports particularly from non-EU countries?</P>
    <P>Is it possible to introduce electronic tagging? Given the technology available nowadays it should be possible to move in that direction. I have been approached by people in my area who specialise in buying calves and selling them in the west. Will the 30 day stipulation apply to them? Is this a permanent stipulation or will it only apply during this emergency period? These issues will be teased out on Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <P>There is genuine concern because a few rogue cattle dealers have brought ignominy on cattle dealing. Many people from Limerick who are involved in cattle dealing have conducted their business respectably for generations. Some people in my constituency have travelled to the Galway area for generations selling calves and are familiar with the farmers there. There is concern that many of them could be driven out of business and some are fearful of the legislation. Perhaps it is not as draconian as they originally thought but I am interested in teasing out some of the nuances of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Department in conjunction with local authorities has introduced stringent controls on abattoirs and butchers' shops. We must seek traceability<i> vis-à-vis</i> the butcher, abattoirs and the consumer. Butchers have provided a respectable service over the years.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, for their efforts over the past number of weeks in dealing with this critical issue. However, more importantly, I pay tribute to the public because <Col N="761" /> there has been a great coming together of people in rural and urban areas to deal with this major problem. There has been grave concern about the cavalier attitude of the British who did not seem to have any sense of responsibility in regard to Irish people.</P>
      <P>The agricultural industry is an important part of our economy and it is important that every effort is made to protect such an important industry. We are all aware of Ireland's dependency on exporting agricultural produce and there is concern that exports will be affected. I pay tribute to people who have made sacrifices over the past three weeks, in particular civil servants in the Department and Teagasc, the Army, the Garda and staff in the DVOs, who have been working around the clock dealing with this crisis. Credit must also be given to the many organisations which cancelled important engagements and put the national interest first. I agree with Deputy Penrose when he called on commercial organisations to consider the postponement of various events in the coming weeks and to reschedule them.</P>
      <P>It is most important that we continue to ensure the foot and mouth disease does not reach Ireland. As chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I also pay tribute to Deputies Dukes and Penrose for their contributions at the committee. Deputy Dukes throws a wobbler every so often but we do not mind that because that is expected of Opposition spokespersons. Generally the suggestions put forward by the Deputies have been taken on board by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have received a number of calls over the past few days from farmers in the south-east expressing concern that grain is being imported from the UK through Cork and Waterford ports by IAWS and other companies. They are worried that foot and mouth will spread here and believe there should be a temporary ban on such imports because some of the grain is coming from large farm operations in the UK. I ask the Minister to refer to this issue when he replies.</P>
      <P>I do not favour emergency legislation but in this case the Minister has no choice because of the actions of a few rogue operators in the industry and the legislation must be enacted quickly. Chancers have been discovered in the industry in the past few weeks trying to sneak across the Border, refusing to stop or to answer questions when apprehended by officials and the Garda and in some cases they have tried to run down gardaí and officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made it clear anyone found guilty of serious wrongdoing will not receive compensation. The taxpayer does not want to pay compensation through the Department to people who are in the wrong. There is a provision for a fine of £1,500 or imprisonment for up to six months but the fine is too low and it should be seriously examined with a view to increasing it because there is no place in the agricultural industry for rogue operators. Individuals have been operating <Col N="762" /> in such a fashion for years and it is important to address the issue.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the operation of some meat plants because there is no doubt there is collusion between rogue dealers and meat plants which needs to be stamped out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for affording me the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I compliment the Minister and the Minister of Sate, Deputy Davern, on the firm and competent way in which they have dealt with this crisis since it began. I also pay tribute to the public at large for the spontaneous response in every sector. The crisis has brought home to the public the value and importance to the economy of the agricultural industry and the necessity to take measures to support the industry, develop it further and to deal with the aftermath of this problem when opportunities will be provided as a result of our disease free status.</P>
      <P>I visited the DVO in Ennis and I pay tribute to the professional manner in which the staff are handling this matter. They have experienced a large volume of work and the issue is ongoing. They have been in touch with various organisations, the Garda and the local authorities to co-ordinate the response locally, which is important as Clare is quite removed from the area affected. I compliment the Aer Rianta staff at Shannon Airport for the way in which they speedily put in place a system which ensured people passing through were made fully aware of the risk involved and the necessity to take precautions to avoid any mistakes which might inadvertently lead to the spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of extra staff and resources to deal with the issues which have arisen as a result of this crisis. There have been complaints for a long time about the lack of financial and human resources to address matters such as the control of meat plants. The provision of such resources is vital in the long term because while we may get over the current alert there will be an ongoing need to be vigilant, to be to the fore in the effort to protect our disease free status and to ensure there is close co-operation between officials who are responsible for these matters and those involved in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation is only part of the defence mechanism that needs to be put in place. Legislation and regulation will not resolve the problems in the industry. Any complacency that may arise because we have avoided a calamity must be put aside quickly. Vigilance must be maintained because it is vital to ensure the special status of the industry is protected. In such a situation there will be financial pressures, especially on some of the smaller farmers who are so dependent on the movement of cattle and the disposal of their flock. In this regard I appeal to the Minister to use his influence with the Community to bring forward some of the payments for farmers due in 2001 and to ensure payments such as the balance of the extensification aid from last year are paid <Col N="763" /> as soon as possible. These are due to be paid in June and there is no reason outstanding payments for 2000 cannot be made now so some of the financial pressure on smaller farmers who are dependent on the movement of stock at this time of year is avoided.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied with the efforts which have been made up to now and put on record my appreciation of the work done by all those in the various organisations, including health boards who put protective measures in place at hospitals and institutions.</P>
    <P>A somewhat more relaxed attitude is necessary in some areas. For example, some farmers have been paying huge penalties of up to £6,000 for minor breaches of the REP scheme and have been disqualified from payment for one or two years. Matters such as this should be dealt with very sensitively at this time and the Minister might direct officials of his Department who are involved in inspections for REPS in this regard. Minor technical breaches of regulations are depriving people of thousands of pounds at this time of crisis in the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The past few weeks have brought considerable focus on the nature and status of animal health controls, food safety and food quality in Ireland. It has taken a significant outbreak of major national economic impact to force us to wake up to the fact that we are far from secure in our acceptance that Ireland is a producer of clean, green food. For as long as I can remember we have heard the mantra of Ireland producing clean, green food, and I want to address some of the problems relating to this assertion.</P>
      <P>The foot and mouth crisis is surely the most compelling argument we have ever had for having an all island approach to the control of animal health and food safety. It is now clear that it is not possible to police the importation of animals to Ireland from other countries. Emergency legislation is necessary to try to stop flagrant disregard for the law and to protect the economy and well being of the country.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the mantra that Ireland has a clean, green image in terms of our food products abroad. To some extent this is true, but I would like to see it quantified and the deficiencies in that assertion addressed. It is only because of the unfortunate foot and mouth disease that we are finally facing up to the fact that at least some of our food cannot be guaranteed as either clean or green. We must produce evidence which supports the assertion that our products are both clean and green. It is no longer acceptable for us to conveniently keep our heads buried in the sand and pretend we have superior products unless we can produce the evidence and traceability to show the world and our own consumers that this is the case. We must identify and put in place systems and ensure they are enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions I have raised the need for a substantial traceability system for all <Col N="764" /> our food products. The country of origin as well as the producer of origin must be identified. One area in bad need of addressing is labelling. A product labelled as produced in Ireland must really originate in Ireland. Are we still expected to believe that products labelled as &ldquo;Irish smoked bacon&rdquo; are the same as &ldquo;smoked Irish bacon&rdquo;? The subtle difference in the order of the words is no more than a sleight of hand designed to confuse. The consumer needs to know if the bacon rather than the smoke is Irish. Furthermore, the consumer would like to know if bacon marketed as Irish is derived from an animal born and reared in Ireland or if the animal gained Irish status because it lived in Ireland for a few months or even a few weeks prior to slaughter. Should the label not read that the product is from an animal slaughtered in Ireland? We should go back a step further and ask if the animal was born, reared and slaughtered in another country and the carcass was imported, with the product being described as Irish. I am asking for clear, unambiguous labelling of all food so consumers can make an informed choice in relation to the products they eat.</P>
    <P>If the incident in Athleague has a message, it is that we do not know and cannot guarantee the origin of what purports to be Irish product. The consumer has lost confidence in the safety and quality of our foods, and that confidence will only be restored through systematic action over a sustained period when we can show the origins of the product can be followed and proved.</P>
    <P>It is not just because of foot and mouth that the Irish farming community, food industry and consumer has reason to worry. Many years on, and after millions of pounds of Irish and European money having been spent, we are still struggling with the plague of TB, brucellosis and, most recently, BSE in cattle. Movement of animals is wide open to the introduction of any number of animal diseases. Free trade is part of the European package and is welcome in a European context. However, the systems which underpin the safety and integrity of our food chain in the EU need to be reviewed. Traceability is one very important aspect in tracking the origins of food and allowing us have confidence that the products we are selling are truly Irish.</P>
    <P>Central to the traceability of animal products is an appropriate tagging system. There has been much discussion on the suitability of tagging and its related problems. However, there are methods for tagging sheep. For example, there are methods of tagging pet dogs. A poodle or Alsatian being transferred to a European country can have a microchip inserted in their ear and we can be assured that the dog taken out of the country is the same as that which is brought back. Therefore, a technology and methodology exists, and it is a matter of addressing the issue effectively and having the will to ensure tagging is in place and that it works.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be supporting the Bill as it is very important the corrupt operators, wher<Col N="765" /> ever they are located and in whatever part of the industry, are brought to account. They must be stopped from damaging the economy, from destroying the credibility of Irish products on the international market and, most importantly, from putting at risk the health of consumers.</P>
    <P>I and my colleagues have already said that foot and mouth disease affects humans only in a very minor and peripheral way, if at all. However, there are many other diseases of animal origin which are enormously significant in the context of human health. We have had to address the problem posed by foot and mouth, but what about the other animal diseases we may import? In particular I am thinking about bacterial diseases such as e.coli 0157. The economic consequences, the personal cost and the loss of lives associated with bacteria such as e.coli 0157 are quite astounding and very worrying. If we have untraceable animals coming into the country I wonder what diseases are being brought with them.</P>
    <P>I again emphasise the importance of separating food, and in particular food safety, from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. I have raised this a number of times and know I am beginning to sound repetitive. The Minister has also answered questions on this a number of times. However, I am not satisfied that food safety should be entirely the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children. Within that Department it should come within the ambit of the Food Safety Authority. The website of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development acknowledges a role for that Department in food safety. I would like this to be clarified and to be again assured that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development does not have a role in the management of food safety. There is a conflict of interest. On the one hand food safety is being policed while on the other hand the Department has a primary responsibility in relation to policy, production and marketing.</P>
    <P>The entire nature of our quality assurance schemes must be examined. We have a series of independent quality assurance schemes which are not very useful and which border on being a waste of time. In many cases they are effectively self-audited and, therefore, have very little status. We need a State supported, quality assurance scheme underpinned in law by a Department of food which would approve and enforce it. We would then know from where any label associated with the quality of a food product originated. It is only right to acknowledge the commitment of many people on both a statutory and voluntary basis to ensuring that foot and mouth has, as we hope, been kept out of the State. There has been considerable inconvenience to many organisations and individuals as well as significant costs. Unfortunately, that cost and inconvenience will have to continue for some considerable time as, judging from the UK situation, we are far from being out of the woods. However, co-operation <Col N="766" /> from almost everyone, on organisation and individual levels, has been admirable.</P>
    <P>The penalties in the Bill have been mentioned. I would like the Bill to be reviewed after six months because by its nature it is emergency legislation and it is important to have the review option. It should be strengthened and reinforced in such a review as we cannot pull back now from the procedures we are putting in place to ensure the integrity of our food chain. Also, those who have broken the law and who are responsible for much of the cost and inconvenience in this part of the country should be dealt with appropriately.</P>
    <P>Foot and mouth has been described as an economic disease and we should be grateful for that. There are no health implications for the consumer and I would not like to think what the consequences would be if there were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate we only have ten minutes to speak on this important legislation as there is a wide range of issues to be dealt with. We should welcome this legislation which seeks to deal with an emergency not just for the agricultural industry but for the entire economy. What has happened in the last three weeks underlines the need for effective control, particularly of food products and livestock movement.</P>
      <P>I do not intend this as criticism of the legislation but as a Border Deputy I do not need to underline the need for reciprocal arrangements in the North. We will do the best we can and the efforts of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Garda and Army personnel as well as volunteers manning check-points in the control zones underline the commitment to keeping foot and mouth out of the country. However, there are severe difficulties north of the Border. Efforts in Britain and the North to stop foot and mouth have been somewhat short of the efforts made here. I do not know if the Minister or his Department is in a position to talk directly to Dundonald House but it would be a considerable help if there was legislation in the North corresponding to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Our experience with sheep coming into the Republic illustrates the importance of sheep tagging. We have considerable traceability for cattle but the sheep sector is a gap in the system. The Minister has signalled that that is on the way, which is welcome.</P>
      <P>Regarding herd owners and farm land immediately north of the Border, in many cases people have farms on both sides of the Border and they are not all in the cattle or sheep dealing business. There is a weakness there because unless we have watertight regulations there will be severe difficulties with the inevitable movement of livestock to and fro, which enhances the risk considerably. I am sure that movement has stopped with the controls now in place but we must look to the future when hopefully this crisis is past. We must learn lessons from this emergency not just regarding foot and mouth but in relation to TB and brucellosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> The outbreaks of BSE and foot and mouth in Ireland and the UK has brought recycling into focus, an issue which has been the subject of simplistic mantras from many people. There is one common thread in the problems with BSE and foot and mouth here and in the UK and that is recycling. While it is not conclusive, all the pointers are that the incorporation of meat and bone meal into feed ingredients has contributed to the spread and development of BSE. Regarding the development of foot and mouth in the UK, all indications point to the recycling of food from Asia or South Africa. There are clear lessons to be learnt from this. There is no point in speakers here or in local authority chambers telling us that recycling <i>per se </i>is the answer to many waste management problems. We would have a catastrophe if foot and mouth gets in, though we hope it will not, but we must examine some of the theories being put forward about recycling in specific areas. That is not to criticise the broad concept of recycling but we must think it through and consider the hazards involved, some of which are shown by this crisis.</P>
    <P>The livestock industry in Ireland is unique in the great mobility of livestock from one farm to another <i>via </i>marts and other channels. The broad consensus among those concerned about animal disease is that that huge mobility has contributed to brucellosis, TB and obviously to foot and mouth. The unique aspect is that most of that mobility is through those dealing in sheep and cattle. In my short sojourn in the Department of Agriculture I was responsible for the fruit and vegetable sector and one concept I was anxious to encourage was that of producer groups. It must be possible to tailor the producer group model to the needs of the livestock sector. We must ask ourselves if we can eliminate the constant movement of livestock. When newly born calves are coming from the south of Ireland to the north-east or midlands, can we operate this through a properly structured producer group system? That must be considered in tandem with this emergency legislation.</P>
    <P>A control zone affects an area of my constituency immediately north of Dundalk. This is an opportunity to congratulate those who have shown forbearance, understanding and consideration for those whose incomes come directly from agriculture. Without their co-operation, the success of the control zone would not have been what it is.</P>
    <P>Many people are being discommoded. The veterinary personnel in the Department are not yet in a position to give a clear time frame for moving back the boundaries of the control zone to the Border but serious consideration must be given to it. The goodwill factor does not have an indefinite time limit. I gauge from the telephone calls to my constituency office a degree of frustration setting in and we need to be careful of that. If the Minister or the veterinary officers are in a position to indicate a time frame, assuming the dis<Col N="768" /> ease does not reach this country, it would be useful and would help considerably to prolong the degree and level of co-operation that exists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton referred to the animal health veterinary regime. The obvious benefit of it operating on an all-island basis has been graphically illustrated by the problems departmental officials and various statutory bodies have had to face over the past fortnight. If the Good Friday Agreement is to have a tangible benefit or commonality of interest, it is in the animal health area. There are clear benefits for farmers, North and South, in establishing a uniform regime for the island. If there are little fiefdoms here and there, let us tackle them. They might not all be in the political arena. Now is the time to set out that objective. We should contact the political parties north of the Border and outline the benefits of a uniform regime, which I am sure they will appreciate. In view of their experience in recent weeks, their appreciation will be sharpened. Now is the time to push ahead with that, in tandem with what we are doing through this legislation.</P>
    <P>I urge that payments due to farmers be made as quickly as possible having regard to the fact that there is no cash flow in the control zone. These payments must be sent out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I generally do not like or support emergency legislation. However, it is extremely necessary on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Three years ago I highlighted in the Dáil, on three separate occasions, the problem of sheep being smuggled into this country. At the time, I received a written apology from the Minister for Finance in relation to that issue. He had given me wrong information but within two days I received a letter from him and an apology. Factories here were being investigated in relation to fraud in the sheep sector. On that occasion I spoke about sheep being brought into this country in the middle of the night and about the rogue dealers. Nothing was done.</P>
      <P>Now there is a serious crisis. The first people to suffer are people in the west of Ireland who are involved in tourism. Jobs are being lost because of events being cancelled and the closure of hotels. This should not have happened. Three important points should be made. The Taoiseach should immediately call on the EU to hold a summit to try to bring on board our partners in Europe, the British Government. The British Government is not taking its responsibilities seriously. That is a disgrace and an outrage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister meet regularly. It is time the Taoiseach spelt out to the Prime Minister how important this issue is. We are outraged that the British Government is doing nothing about it. Life is continuing as normal. The rugby international was held last week as were the premier championship soccer matches. Everything is continuing as if nothing has happened and we are afraid to speak out in case we upset the British Government. There should be an EU summit immediately to put <Col N="769" /> manners on the British. If this disease spreads to the rest of Europe, those countries will not sit back and tolerate what is happening. It is typical of Britain's attitude &ndash; Ireland does not matter. They do not care about the Irish. The Taoiseach and his great friend and comrade, the British Prime Minister, must get their act together and do something about this.</P>
    <P>The first job the new chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and his committee should undertake is a full investigation of the meat factories. The Government has turned a blind eye to the factories. I do not know the reason but I am sure others do. It does not appear to want to take them on. The factories have behaved badly and it is a disgrace that they have been let away with it. The Committee of Public Accounts should investigate them immediately. I also call on the Minister with responsibility for the Revenue Commissioners, Deputy McCreevy, immediately to organise an audit of every factory in the State. They are all breaking the law, as we have seen in recent weeks, and are getting away with it. What action is being taken by the Minister?</P>
    <P>I further call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take action against the factories that allowed these sheep in. The sheep were tagged but the tags were removed. They were brought into the State in the middle of the night. What prosecutions will be taken against the people responsible?</P>
    <P>The tagging issue was mentioned earlier. Officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development are here for this debate. If the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, does one thing, despite only being in that office for a short time, he should ensure the Department does not use tagging as an excuse for not paying genuine farmers REPS and other payments. The new excuse from the Department is that its officials cannot go on the farmers' lands to carry out inspections because of the foot and mouth disease crisis. I propose that all payments due to farmers be made immediately and if there are problems later, they can be dealt with in the next payments. I do not want to be back in the House in a fortnight talking about thousands of farmers not being paid the money due to them. I will not accept the excuse that the officials cannot go on to the farmers' lands.</P>
    <P>This disease is a terrible scourge and I call on the Taoiseach and the Government to act immediately.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil as am a fháil ó Fhine Gael chun labhairt ar an mBille. Tá an Comhaontas Glas ag tacú leis an mBille mar reachtaíocht phráinneach agus is ceart athbhreithniú a dhéanamh air taobh istigh de sé mhí ar a mhéid. Táimid ag tacú leis ar an gcoinníoll sin agus ar an gcoinníoll sin amháin. Is ceart chomh maith féachaint ar an bhfadhb sa bhfad-théarma agus sa ghearr-théarma. In the short time available I will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> There is a palpable fear among farmers. They are frightened of the implications of foot and mouth disease arriving in Ireland. That also applies to many others both inside and outside the farming sector.</P>
    <P>A question still hangs over how effective any measures such as these can be in terms of stopping the illegal transportation of animals over the Border or other illegal practices in animal dealing. That worry becomes more real when one reads the Bill and discovers that it is not expected to have any implications for the Exchequer. Funds will come from existing resources. Will the number of authorised officers be adequate to give effect to the Bill and how effective will the legislation be as a result?</P>
    <P>Many jobs are endangered, particularly in the tourism sector with St. Patrick's weekend and Easter so near. Conferences have been cancelled and many enterprises face the prospect of laying off workers. That reality should focus our minds towards dealing effectively with this matter.</P>
    <P>The longer term issue which needs to be addressed is the increasing trend of closing small abattoirs. This is particularly the case in the UK which is at the centre of the worst effects of this problem. Some suggest that abattoirs have to close because they are unable to meet EU standards. However, the increasing stress caused to animals by transporting them over longer distances impinges on their health and makes them more susceptible to disease. We need to address this vicious circle in the longer term.</P>
    <P>The national development plan should provide capital investment to bring smaller abattoirs up to standard. Some farming organisations have proposed funding mobile facilities to ensure greater local access to slaughter facilities in certain regions.</P>
    <P>Since the outbreak of foot and mouth in 1967, international trade in food has tripled so there is significantly more transportation taking place now than in 1967. The transportation of milk in the UK has increased thirty-fold since 1980. The natural follow-on from this trend is that livestock hauliers are forced to literally go the extra mile by the economic challenges they face. This creates significant temptations to break rules regarding resting and proper feeding and watering of animals, all of which adds to distress and the likelihood of animals being infected.</P>
    <P>These practices do not suit the needs of customers. They are primarily designed to ensure a cheap food regime on which all of us must reflect. This food is not cheap given the measures we are forced to take by events such as the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk made a valid point regarding the feeding of meat and bonemeal to herbivores. This is an atrocious infringement of the laws of nature and man. Proper recycling is about adhering to the laws of nature and not trying to go against them. It is a travesty to describe the feeding of meat and bonemeal to herbivores as recycling. <Col N="771" /> This practice is against the spirit of everything which should be happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill which I support in so far as it goes. However, the Bill is not as extensive as it should be. Most of the Bill is aimed at farmers and cattle or sheep dealers. Factories are not referred to in the Bill. There is no new regulation or rule regarding factories, although some of the powers conferred on authorised officers can be used with regard to factories. However, the Bill's weakness is that it does not include factories. There is considerable truth in Deputy Ring's comments regarding factories and their continuous breach of regulations and non-co-operation. As I well know, there is a background to this situation which goes back a long time.</P>
      <P>Both Houses would agree that the Minister adopted a reasonable approach in the Seanad yesterday where he accepted quite a number of amendments. I would like him to do likewise in this House as the Seanad can complete consideration of any amendments tonight. One amendment which the Minister should accept would be to include factories in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would be supportive, for example, of the amendment which Senator O'Toole tabled to the effect that if a factory accepted an animal which was in breach of regulations, the factory would commit an offence if it slaughtered the animal and added it to the food chain. The Minister should have accepted this amendment but unfortunately he did not do so. This amendment would have covered a situation where, for example, sheep are taken to a factory in the Republic having been brought here from a foot and mouth area in England, through Northern Ireland. It is obvious that such sheep are brought here illegally as can be seen by the removal of the British tags from their ears. This had to be known to the factories. However, the factories, as is their wont, kept their mouths shut, slaughtered away and exported these carcasses as Irish lamb. This practice does a serious disservice to Irish lamb and is typical of what has been going on for many years.</P>
      <P>Before Committee Stage I hope the Minister will reconsider the issue of factories and at least accept the spirit of Senator O'Toole's amendment. I have not had a chance to study the amendment as this is all happening so quickly. However, the Minister should accept the amendment, even in an amended form.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned by the provisions in sections 4 and 5 whereby a long list of orders made under the Diseases of Animals Acts are to be confirmed. The Minister stated that he is taking this step under legal advice. Many Members know it is sometimes better to ignore legal advice.</P>

      <P>&mdash;that it is necessary to confirm these orders, including those made two or three days ago, does this not suggest that the orders are or may be defective, and that they are open to challenge?</P>
      <P>The order of 1956 is one of the orders which this Bill will confirm and put beyond legal doubt. That order predated the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, but it is the main order under which the Department has been operating. It is disturbing that the order's validity is now called into question and that the Oireachtas is being asked to verify it or put its validity beyond doubt. The Minister should explain why he is inserting a highly unusual provision in the Bill to confirm a raft of orders dating from 1956 to as recently as this week. I am disturbed by this measure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring spoke about the advisability of asking the Committee of Public Accounts to examine factories. I presume the Deputy was referring to meat factories in this context and I would not object if the committee did so. I am not sure if this is within the committee's terms of reference. Deputy Ring called on the new chairman of the committee, Deputy Finucane, to carry out such an examination. I remind Deputy Ring that, two years ago, Deputy Finucane's predecessor, Deputy Jim Mitchell, famously called for a forensic audit of the activities of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development as regards animals and factories.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell was infuriated by the evidence given over a number of years by accounting officers of that Department, and their non-disclosure to the committee of many relevant matters. Unfortunately, Deputy Mitchell's anger was diluted and the forensic audit he called for ended up as some sort of inquiry into whether or not the Department's computer systems were adequate. The Department had no objection to inanimate objects like computers being investigated, but not its officials.</P>

      <P>The powers in section 2 are extensive and I fully support them. It is one thing to legislate for extensive powers but quite another to use them and put them into operation. No matter how extensive the powers are, if they are not used by the Department officials and authorised officers in the way they are intended to be used, they will not succeed. When investigating potential malpractice among dealers, farmers or particularly in factories, one must make spot checks. These places should be raided in order to examine the animals, yet that has not been the practice of the Department. For many years, spot checks and unannounced raids <Col N="773" /> were unusual. We even had the spectacle of some person or persons within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development ringing factories in advance to say that they were going to be raided. That happened time and time again, and the Minister knows that well. Will that sort of practice continue? We are wasting our time giving authorised officers the powers contained in section 2 unless they use them as this House and the Upper House intend them to be used, that is, to ensure the enforcement of and compliance with the laws on this important topic.</P>
      <P>People may think that because for two weeks now we have escaped foot and mouth disease infection on this side of the Border, we are safe or can become more complacent and less restrictive. That is not so. Half an hour ago I heard on the lunch time news of 104 confirmed cases of foot and mouth disease in Britain. That is alarming. The outbreaks cover the whole of Britain, unlike in 1967 when it was all confined to one area. We are in severe danger and I am glad the Minister is reacting in this way. I urge him and people generally not to relax their vigilance.</P>

      <P>Over the past worrying few weeks, farmers and many others involved in the food industry have looked to this House to ensure that emergency measures, including restrictions, are put in place to keep foot and mouth disease out of the State. We are responding with legislation to ensure that in future we will be in a better position to respond to the continued threat of the disease, or an outbreak. I compliment the Government on introducing the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Bill quickly although I have some concerns about the sense of rushing important legislation through the House without sufficient time for fuller consideration of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We support the measures being introduced in the Bill because of the immediate need to respond to problems within the agricultural sector, including smuggling and illegal livestock dealing, that have led to the increased and significant risk of disease, primarily foot and mouth disease, spreading from the UK to livestock here. I agree with my party's spokesman on agriculture, Deputy Dukes, who said the legislation should only be allowed to last for a relatively short time. We have suggested 1 June 2001 as a suitable date for the legislation to lapse. This would allow the Oireachtas to consider more fully the infection of animals and foodstuffs, and to construct more <Col N="774" /> comprehensive legislation without the time pressure we are under today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney:</NameTxt>
      <P>That emphasises my point that we are rushing through the legislation. I come from the largest agricultural county, so I am more aware than most people of the need to introduce tough measures, including increased fines, prison sentences and more powers for the authorities in dealing with smuggling and disease control. I agree with many other speakers who have contributed to the debate, including Deputy Upton, who pointed out how narrowly focused the Bill is. I support the point she made concerning the traceability of food and feedstuffs, particularly food that is coming from outside the EU. It is now generally recognised that the reason foot and mouth disease entered the UK in the first place was because of food that went into pig swill and that had originated outside the EU. It is time we had legislation to ensure that all foodstuffs on supermarket shelves and in animal feeds, whether originating in the EU or outside it, has accurate traceability. Such measures are required, although they are not contained in this legislation.</P>

        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am not at all convinced by the introduction of this Bill. Emergency legislation pretending to deal with something is a typical and classic ploy of Governments when a crisis hits. In reality it is a cover-up for failures up to the present. In a much more tragic scenario we had emergency legislation after the catastrophic Omagh bombing, but it has not achieved what the Government said it would. It is window dressing and should be seen as such. The Minister should tell the House what would be different if this legislation was on the Statute Book compared to what precautions have been taken in the past two weeks. Everybody knows that existing legislation was not implemented. In particular, meat processors and those supplying them illegally by smuggling goods under false pretences were not subject to proper checks.</P>
      <P>Several years ago the satirical radio programme <i>Scrap Saturday</i> famously featured Daisy the cow which was part of the carousel of beef passing across the Border several times. It finished up as a very confused animal in order to avail of certain subsidies, but what has changed? The country's animal health programme has been put at great risk by similar practices in a different context. Why was that matter not dealt with when successive Governments and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, knew quite well that was going on? This legislation is an excuse. We should examine far more radically why animal diseases now spread like wildfire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> The main political parties have not addressed that question. Let us consider the current means used to rear animals and the horrific conditions in which they are kept. On certain farms hundreds of sows are chained together with no room to move and tens of thousands of chickens are kept in confined spaces. It is obvious that, in those conditions, disease will spread like wildfire. Add to this the mobility of trade, which has reached ridiculous proportions, and a disaster such as the one which has befallen Britain will result.</P>
    <P>When the last outbreak occurred in Britain in the 1960s, only Shropshire, parts of north Wales and north-west England were affected. On this occasion, however, the disease has spread far and wide because of the ludicrous closure of local abattoirs which has led to dealers hairing to travel all over the world and bring disease with them. The modern capitalist methods used in agriculture should be subjected to rigorous scrutiny. There should be a return not to what Deputy Dukes would refer to as feudalism&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a number of brief points. It is obvious that the situation in the United Kingdom has reached epidemic proportions and it is essential that we protect the agriculture and food industries in this country. I am not sure that this emergency Bill will do so. I am disappointed that a small number of rogue farmers, rogue dealers and rogue meat plants have brought us to the brink of disaster. I am particularly disappointed that the Bill contains no specific provisions to deal with meat plants. Everyone is aware that there is a need to take action in respect of the dubious, if not illegal, conduct at Athleague. Indeed, there is a need to address the situation which obtains at nearly all meat plants throughout the country. The Minister should take on board the amendments tabled in respect of this matter.</P>
      <P>There is a serious level of concern among part-time and small dealers throughout the country in relation to the 30 day rule and the impact it will have on their livelihoods. These people are essential to the agriculture industry and they want to continue to make an honest living to support themselves and their families. In my opinion the 30 day rule will have a significantly adverse impact on them and I ask the Minister to reconsider the position. The dealers indicated that a one mart movement would be helpful and the Minister should look at their proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a later date we should investigate the type of factory farm practices that have, in effect, brought us to this juncture. These practices have allowed foot and mouth disease to enter Britain <Col N="776" /> and have given rise to the threat of an outbreak in this country. Like other Members, I believe this emergency legislation should lapse within a short period. I agree that 1 June would be an appropriate cut-off point in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis:</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that we should express our sincere gratitude to the staff of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Teagasc and the gardaí who have done a good job on the Border in the past two weeks. In comparison, the efforts of the officials of DANI across the Border leave a great deal to be desired. To put it mildly, the efforts of the authorities in Northern Ireland have been exceptionally poor and they have made no attempt to ensure that people and vehicles crossing the Border are properly disinfected. If the officials stationed at Larne had been doing their job during the past six months, we might not be experiencing our current difficulties. We are reaping the legacy of people who failed to act to stop the movement of animals.</P>
      <P>There is a need to remain vigilant. Local radio stations and newspapers should continue to be used to transmit the message that while we have escaped an outbreak to date, we are anything but close to being out of the woods. This problem is going to be with us for a considerable period. The outbreaks occurring across England, Scotland and Wales prove that the disease is totally out of control in the UK and that the authorities there appear to lack the commitment to deal with it. I appeal to the British Government to make a concerted effort to try to control the problem and bring it to an end.</P>
      <P>No Member of either House welcomes the introduction of emergency legislation. However, there is no doubt that the Bill is necessary because there is a need to show that the law will deal with people who act in an unscrupulous manner. Questions have been raised with regard to the smuggling of animals in recent years. Everyone is aware that this has been happening. Some of the activities in which people engaged could not be justified, on any economic grounds, because they do not stand up to scrutiny. This proves that someone somewhere along the line was fiddling the system; otherwise what was being done could not have been done.</P>
      <P>While the provisions in the Bill grant a great deal of latitude to certain sections of the Department and the Garda Síochána, I believe they are necessary in the short term. I welcome the fact that the legislation will be reviewed after one year. I also welcome the amendments made to the Bill during yesterday's debate in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of issues which must be given consideration. People who are legitimately <Col N="777" /> involved in the livestock trade feel they are being targeted and there is a need for the Department to explain to them that they have nothing to fear from the Bill. The only people with anything to fear are those who have acted in an unscrupulous manner, such as those who have been involved in smuggling and other questionable activities which have no place in a country that is a major food producer. As Deputy O'Malley stated, there is a need for careful consideration of the activities of the processing industry. It is well known that some processors were importing product which was relabelled for export. No one wants to see such practices continue.</P>
    <P>We must also investigate the source of imported feed products, many of which may originate in countries which do not have white list status. There is a need to ensure that all imported products can be traced and that the people who import them can attest to their origins. That is imperative. With regard to the slaughter of animals, it is vital that verification of ownership can be produced. The penalties for slaughtering stock in someone else's name should be extremely severe.</P>
    <P>While there is no doubt that we are in the midst of a crisis, if we manage to avoid an outbreak of foot and mouth disease we could see the beginnings of a return of confidence in the agriculture industry. We must retain our disease free status and there is a need to do everything possible to ensure that this happens. It must be made clear to members of the public that the problems which have arisen in the past week will remain with us for the coming months and that those intent on travelling must exercise a degree of vigilance. I appeal again to people not to visit the countryside. There is a problem in my constituency with hill walkers who are trespassing on people's land. This type of activity should be suspended until the present crisis is over.</P>

      <P>It is with sadness that we welcome this emergency legislation but as previous speakers have said, people have nothing to fear from it if they are acting for the good of farming and the country and if they do not intend to break the law.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. He reacted with haste and implemented strict measures at a time when other countries dragged their feet. Dragging one's feet on this issue is very dangerous as we can see from other countries not far from ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the gardaí who, along with the Army, are doing a tremendous job on the Border. My constituency has a coastline of 140 miles, a couple of miles of border with the Republic but 70 miles of border with the rest of the North. In that respect, it is vitally important that we develop the all-Ireland dimension to agriculture and I commend the Minister on working so closely with Minister Bríd Rodgers in the Executive but every stop must be pulled out in the Six <Col N="778" /> Counties to implement the strict measures we are implementing here.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the enormous level of public participation on this issue, whether through the media or in relation to individuals or groups. The Three Musketeers philosophy, all for one and one for all, has come into vogue at an unprecedented level here in the past few weeks. Everyone has rallied to the call bar a few. This is not just an agricultural event. It is an event that cuts across every sector of our community and those sectors are making every effort to deal with the problem. That is vitally important.</P>
    <P>With more than 104 cases in Britain it is fair to say that foot and mouth disease is rampant in that country yet it does not appear to have addressed the problem at all. I add my voice to those who are calling on the European Union to protect us. We are putting in place the strictest of measures yet events like the Cheltenham races are not cancelled because the organisers thought it was a bad idea but because the sheep had not been long enough removed from the racecourse. That is not a good enough reason. There is no respect for the seriousness of this disease nor is there any respect for the neighbouring countries in terms of the way the disease is being treated currently by the British agriculture Minister. The EU needs to examine that issue.</P>
    <P>A small number of people in Ireland could ruin it all for us and as a Border Deputy, I appeal to everyone in the farming sector or any office holder who has not been fully compliant with the law to observe the strict measures in this legislation. I hope this legislation is not in place for a long period and that its measures will not be used against anyone because they should be aware that their short-term benefits have long-term implications.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister again for his efforts and I congratulate the people who are being discommoded because they are dealing with this problem with the seriousness it requires. I hope that continues until we get over this problem.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Chair will indicate when I have reached midway. As a Border Deputy I welcome this opportunity to speak on the scourge we have found ourselves facing. I live within three miles of south Armagh and my parish is actually in south Armagh so I have a deep interest in it. I take a slightly different view from that of my colleagues &ndash; that might not surprise some of them &ndash; in that I have to congratulate the Minister because if we judge him by results, he has so far kept the scourge out of this country. <Col N="779" /> He has to take a bow in that regard. I know there are issues with which we could disagree and perhaps the measures put in place were not all that they could have been but we must remember it is 40 years since the previous outbreak occurred. We must learn from that. In the event of this disease resurfacing in years to come, which we all hope will not happen, I hope definite and immediate measures such as those called for by Deputy Dukes will be put in place and that there will not be any delay in implementing them.</P>
      <P>On two occasions here I have criticised the gardaí, the only person to do so. They were being eulogised by everybody in the House. It was only a minor criticism but I would like to repeat it today. Their handling of the traffic in and out of the biggest town in Ireland could have been better. I do not know why people leaving Dundalk, eight miles from the Border, had to be held up interminably in queues. People going to their homes on the northern side of Dundalk should not have been held up like that. There should have been a specific line of lorry traffic into Dundalk and a specific line of southern registered cars because these cars were waved through having had to wait for several hours.</P>
      <P>The gardaí have discovered public relations. They are like politicians now. They know all about PR and they were aided and abetted by RTE with dramatic coverage of the fight on the Border and flashbacks to Cork, Kerry and Mayo. It was not as dramatic as that although they have done a very good job, as have the veterinarians currently billeted in the grounds of Ballymascanlon Hotel.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the fact that an eminent native of Armagh is in the chair so I have to mute my reference to that lovely part of the country but south Armagh has been the cradle of smuggling since the foundation of the State. The time has come for a reappraisal of the effectiveness and the duties of customs officials. They have done a great job over the years but in recent times, because of the introduction of the Single European Act, they have been sidelined and they are not as evident on the ground as they had been in the past. They should be brought back into the fight against rogue dealers. There are rogue dealers in every walk of life and these officials should be invited to work with veterinarians in inspecting meat in meat plants on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>This is emergency legislation and in so far as it is deemed necessary to deal with the current foot and mouth crisis I support it but it clearly needs to be reviewed within a short period. That sentiment has been expressed by other speakers and I hope the Minister will take that on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives the Minister and those appointed as authorised officers sweeping powers. Such powers should not be granted lightly nor should they remain on the Statute Book without regular review of the fairness and effectiveness of their <Col N="780" /> operation. We must ask if this legislation would be necessary if an emergency plan had been in place to cope with such a crisis. The truth is that this country, this island, was not prepared. The Government here and the Executive in Belfast had to put together a response very quickly. That response was initially ill co-ordinated and in some respects ill thought out. People had difficulty obtaining the appropriate disinfectant and high prices were charged by unscrupulous suppliers. There is much talk of a ring of steel around the Border but it was more illusion than reality, certainly in the earlier stages. For example, many busy roads had not the required disinfectant mats and many of these were of inadequate size.</P>
    <P>If we had a coherent and co-ordinated all Ireland approach to agriculture, including monitoring and enforcement of stricter regulations on animal health, movement of animals and standards in the production and distribution of food, then the Border, which is impossible to seal, would be irrelevant as far as this disease is concerned. That lesson must be learned and I look forward to strengthened and deepened cross-Border co-operation in this area and others.</P>
    <P>Much more is required than this Bill in order to implement the lessons learned from this crisis. I hope the Minister and the Department will take them on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh):</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the various contributions on this Bill. It is emergency legislation to deal with a specific, serious problem.</P>
      <P>Some general points were made and Members took the opportunity to pay tribute to the work done by my Department's officials, the Garda Síochána, the Army and a range of State agencies and bodies, which I appreciate. Particular mention should be made of the two gardaí injured on the Border to which Deputy Penrose referred.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, some Deputies made political points quite unfairly. Deputy Dukes was, to my dismay, extremely mealy mouthed in his contribution. He could not find it in his heart to pay tribute to anyone, never mind the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Garda or all the people who worked under arduous conditions and in inclement weather at short notice. I again pay tribute to them.</P>
      <P>Some political points were made about the tardiness of the response. The opposite was the case. Our response was exemplary and if some of our neighbours had made a similar one they might not be in the trouble they are. The facts are that we do not have foot and mouth or clinical signs of it yet. All of the preliminary tests, both tissue and blood, are clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, we have a contingency plan and I have a copy here. It is revised every three or four years. It is submitted to the EU and dry runs are carried out as if we had a case of the disease. We do not have one, of course, but we are operating as if we <Col N="781" /> do. It is in the UK and the North of Ireland yet we have to respond to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had ten minutes and he spent it all apart from one minute criticising individuals and criticising Departments. I expect something more constructive from the Deputy.</P>
      <P>On 22 February, two days after confirmation of the outbreak in Britain, an editorial in <i>The Irish Times </i>stated:</P>
      <P>The Government has responded with commendable urgency to the news of the outbreak. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Mr. Walsh, immediately imposed a ban on the importation of all live animals, animal products, including fresh meat and meat products, milk and milk products, hides and skins from Britain and Northern Ireland. Departmental staff and members of the gardaí will enforce that ban at ports and airports in relation to food imports. The Minister has ordered members of the public to exercise particular caution, to avoid visiting farms, particularly in affected areas.</P>
      <P>That was done but people either inadvertently or deliberately missed the point that the single most important point was to restrict animals, because animal contact is the priority risk, as Deputy Upton pointed out.</P>
      <P>We extended it to other areas and appealed to people, institutions and organisations like the health and safety body. There is an onus on individuals, and, fair play to them, 99.9% responded magnificently. However, in some cases, people expected someone else to provide the mat and disinfectant for them. Today's editorial in the <i>Irish Farmer's Journal</i> says:</P>
      <P>The Government, and specifically the Department of Agriculture, has all along rightly identified the main priority as shutting off imports and then identifying and slaughtering the animals potentially in contact with infected animals. The fact that most of these were smuggled makes the job incomparably more difficult. The Department has been spectacularly successful. As this phase thankfully ends, the determination to keep the virus out until 30 days has lapsed after the last UK outbreak has to be reinforced. So far so good, but the greatest danger is complacency.</P>
      <P>I made this case repeatedly. We are still on high alert. We cannot be complacent. We have been successful so far. I do not doubt that were it not for the immediacy and focus of the response and the outstanding work done by many people since the confirmation of the outbreak two weeks ago, we would not be in this position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes got the point wrong also about animal movement. It was introduced on the 28th and only refined last Saturday by way of permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points were made by Deputy Pen<Col N="782" /> rose, particularly regarding the constitutional matter. I and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, checked this and the legal advice from the Attorney General's office is that it is not unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley and others expressed concern over sections 4 and 5 which confirmed the orders previously made. The Attorney General's advice does not suggest that these are defective. He believes that it would be prudent to confirm them in this way because when an order deals with important matters there is the risk of a challenge on the grounds that too much power was delegated to the Minister. This can be averted by the Oireachtas confirming the relevant orders as is being done now.</P>
    <P>Slaughter without compensation was raised by Deputy Penrose. He asked if there will be constitutional problems with section 9. I am advised that is not the case as there is no general right to compensation and the Rooney case makes it clear that the Minster decides on compensation. Where section 17 of the Act is used, compensation is provided for.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the issue of whether the permit system involves the identification of individual animals. This is not the case. The system will be applied with the necessary flexibility and common sense to ensure that it will not handicap legitimate business. We want legitimate business to continue because, as has been said in the Seanad and the Dáil, the cattle trade has developed with agents and dealers, the vast majority of whom do a sound job. This legislation is targeted at the rogues. We want to ensure that the live trade in particular continues. The permit system, and Deputy Dukes referred to this, applies only when and where the Minister has made an order that the 30 day restriction is needed for disease control.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to the length of time of this Bill, 12 months; this is a reasonable length of time. To take it up to the summer is unrealistic. It would give it no chance to do anything. Twelve months is a reasonable length of time, as it brings us up to the start of next year. It will then be a matter for the Dáil to decide whether it should be renewed or be allowed to lapse. A number of these issues, such as the national beef assurance scheme, can be discussed when the agriculture appeals Bill returns to the Dáil in the next few weeks.</P>

    <P>(6)It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I thank the Opposition Whips for facilitating this debate this afternoon, as it necessary to move these resolutions to enable us to provide necessary notification before 1 April.</P>
    <P>I also take this opportunity to apologise, as I said I would, to Deputy Howlin. I accused him last night of telling a lie in the House. He kindly checked the Dáil record for me and it transpires that I misheard the Deputy. I unreservedly withdraw the remark, and I apologise to Deputy Howlin.</P>
    <P>This resolution provides for amendment of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act, 1952, and the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1992, in relation to rates of motor tax and fees for trade licence plates. The House will be aware that at the end of last year press notice was given of the intention to change motor tax rates from the 1 April 2001. Not all motor tax rates are being increased, but where increases are proposed, smaller increases <Col N="788" /> are to be applied to smaller cars which generally use less fuel and give rise to lower carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
    <P>Motor taxation is paid directly into the local government fund. This fund, which was established under the Local Government Act, 1998, is provided in law for the specific purpose of local government and cannot be used by the Exchequer for other purposes. The fund is financed from the proceeds of motor taxation which is supplemented by an Exchequer contribution. The fund is used to finance non-national roads and the general purpose needs of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The general purpose grants which are made from the fund to local authorities replace the old rate support grants. They are discretionary and may be used by authorities for whatever purpose they consider necessary, but are generally used to supplement other local income sources such as commercial rates and charges to finance their day to day operations. These operations cover a wide range of programmes for which local authorities have responsibility such as housing, roads, water and sewerage, planning, the natural environment, recreation and amenities and community development.</P>
    <P>Local authorities face significantly increased costs in the delivery of these programmes for 2001 and must accordingly be adequately resourced to fund these increased costs if they are to meet the demands. In addition, local authorities are charged with delivering on large elements of the national development plan which is vital for social and economic development. It is imperative, therefore, that they have sufficient financial resources available to deliver this work. Local authorities' responsibilities do not end there, as the delivery of significant capital projects under the national development plan will have considerable implications for authorities in terms of operation and maintenance costs. Additional resources which arise from changes in motor tax rates will help local authorities to meet their commitments and to provide more and better quality services to the community.</P>
    <P>New rates will apply to tax discs and trade licences taken out for periods beginning on or after 1 April 2001. As regards private cars, three different rates of increase are proposed depending on engine size. There will be a 4% increase for cars up to 1100cc, which represents an annual rate increase of £4 to £6, a 5% increase from 1101cc to 1500cc, which means annual increases of between £8 and £10, and a 6% increase for cars of 1501cc and over. These increases will range from £15 at the lower end of this bracket to £51 for cars over 3001cc. Almost two thirds of all cars are under 1500cc and will be subject to annual increases of between £4 and £10 &ndash; between about 8p and 19p a week.</P>
    <P>A flat 6% increase is proposed for goods vehicles. At the minimum goods vehicle rate, which incidentally is paid by over four-fifths of commercial vehicle owners, this represents an <Col N="789" /> annual increase of £10, or less than 20p per week. A revision of motorcycle tax rates is proposed to reflect the different engine sizes of these vehicles. The single rate of £22 is being replaced by the three tax bands, which existed prior to 1992. The new rates proposed vary between £25 for motorcycles under 75cc to £45 for motorcycles over 200cc.</P>
    <P>There is also a tax class that includes vehicles constructed only for the conveyance of a built-in machine or workshop and includes recovery vehicles. Outside of recovery vehicles which collect disabled vehicles, this class includes cranes, well-boring machines and fish and chip vans. These vehicles, like goods vehicles, are designed and constructed for the carriage of various items in the course of trade or profession. It is proposed to bring these vehicles into line with the goods vehicle class and to increase their rate to the new goods vehicle minimum of £170.</P>
    <P>As with goods vehicles, a 6% increase is proposed for agricultural tractors. It is proposed to align non-agricultural or general haulage tractors with the minimum goods vehicle rate. Average increases of 12% are proposed for trade licences, or trade plates as they are known. These are the green registration plates used by motor traders on vehicles, which are temporarily in their possession, in lieu of taxing such vehicles. While there are strict restrictions on the use of the plates, they are transferable between vehicles.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to introduce two new motor tax classes. The first of these is to be a class covering all vehicles, irrespective of whether they are private vehicles or goods vehicles, which are used exclusively on an offshore island to which there is no direct road or bridge access from the mainland. A reduced rate of just £52 per annum is proposed for this class. This reduction is in recognition of the limited use of such vehicles and that some owners require a vehicle both on an island and on the mainland. The reduced rate will not apply to vehicles on islands such as Achill or Valentia which are connected to the mainland.</P>
    <P>The second new tax class comprises all vehicles which are used exclusively for mountain and cave rescue purposes. It is proposed to exempt this class of vehicle from motor tax altogether. Vehicles used exclusively for transporting lifeboats, ambulances, fire brigade vehicles and State owned vehicles are already exempt from motor tax. Exempting this new class of vehicle for motor tax purposes completes a motor tax exemption for all emergency vehicles.</P>
    <P>One of the primary reasons for rebalancing motor tax rates is to reflect their impact on the environment. As a greening measure, no increases are proposed for public service vehicles such as buses, taxis and hackneys. Youth and community buses, school buses and electric vehicles are also being exempted.</P>
    <P>While not covered by the resolution, it is also relevant to report to the House on other measures proposed for introduction in tandem with the introduction of new motor tax rates. As <Col N="790" /> a measure to assist people who may face difficulty in taxing their cars on a full year basis, regulations are being introduced to provide for a reduction in the surcharge which applies to vehicles which are taxed half yearly or quarterly. It is proposed that these regulations will come into effect from 1 April 2001.</P>
    <P>This financial resolution will cease on the enactment of the relevant Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill, 2001, which has been approved by the Government and will be presented at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Clune.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to paying road taxes, and certainly no fundamental objection even to paying increased road taxes. Most people would accept that road users should make some direct contribution to the cost of maintaining roads over and above that paid by the general taxpayer. There are huge demands now being made on local authorities in all areas but specifically in the area of roads, in trying to maintain non-national roads, even to increase the road building programme, in the control of road openings and in bringing some sort of order into it. Even in road sweeping, road safety and all sorts of other areas, there are demands on local authorities. For that reason I am reluctant to oppose this measure. I certainly would prefer a tax on cars to a tax on the elderly or on their children for keeping their parents in nursing homes.</P>
      <P>I am opposing this resolution because it is a fraud. Does the Minister see no irony in a Minister from a party which some years ago abolished motor tax altogether coming in now with proposals to increase it? Does he see no irony in the fact that, when this measure was introduced some years ago to ring-fence this fund for local government, the Minister described it as a disgrace that local government should be funded by being pulled behind the family car?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My fundamental objection to this is the Minister's attempt to make a virtue of it as a green tax. It most certainly is not a green tax, and the Minister knows that very well. He knows it because he knows what a green tax is, given that he promised us one in the form of a tax on plastic bags &ndash;  such taxes must be terribly difficult to produce because after two years we have not yet got it, but we have this tax after two months when it was announced surreptitiously as a sort of codicil to the budget This is not a green tax. It is a tax on ownership, not on usage. This tax is paid whether the car is in use or not. If it were a genuinely green tax it would discourage usage and we would all, as a result, drive less. On the contrary this is a fixed tax, and by increasing the opportunity cost of leaving our cars in the driveway, we encourage more use in order to try to spread the cost over additional miles. Not alone therefore is it not a green tax, it is quite the opposite. It is good old fashioned traditional rev<Col N="791" /> enue raising, and the Minister should not try to dress it up as anything else.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's press statement he said that policy in relation to motor tax does not form any part of taxation policy generally. Apparently this is because it is ring-fenced for local government. It is nonsense to say that. It is part of taxation policy. It is a revenue raising exercise. Otherwise why bother to increase it? It is certainly not out of environmental concern. The truth is that if this tax were not in existence, the Exchequer would have to fund local government directly, and the more this tax yields, the less pressure is on the Exchequer generally. Let us not pretend it is not a tax or a budgetary measure. It is.</P>
    <P>It is not even a local tax, which might have some merit. If it were a local tax, spent where it is collected, my local authority would be extremely rich, but it is one of the poorest. The distribution of this tax, like every other aspect of local government, is entirely centrally controlled. It is distributed to the various local authorities according to some unknown formula, and it is certainly an unfair formula.</P>
    <P>The Minister is either confused about this tax or he is deliberately adopting an entirely contradictory approach. On the one hand he is suggesting that it is a green tax aimed at reducing car usage &ndash; it will not, but that is the Minister's claim for it &ndash; and on the other hand, it is also being claimed as a tax which will increase funding to local authorities. It seems to me and to any logical person that there is something of a dichotomy in that position. The only logical conclusion one can draw from it is that the Minister's intention and his desire is to fund local government from a source of financing which he is also seeking to diminish. If the Minister really had any environmental concern and genuinely wanted to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, if he had any real desire for achieving more sustainable transport modes, he would be battering the door of his colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to get more buses onto the streets of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister with responsibility for housing expects the Dublin authorities to increase their output of houses to 20,000 or even 25,000 a year, depending on which figure one believes. However, this year not one single additional bus has been funded for Dublin Bus. If the Minister finds that amazing, he will be completely gobsmacked to hear the reason, which is that there is nowhere to garage additional buses. Can the Minister explain or defend that? Can the Cabinet sub-committee on the infrastructural deficit explain why there is such appalling lack of planning that we cannot have buses because we have no garage? How can the public have any confidence in the Minister?</P>
    <P>I was present in Malahide when the Minister launched the strategic planning guidelines and promised that the additional houses would be accompanied by additional transport. Since then <Col N="792" /> the Minister has not said a word about additional transport. All of those new households now have one option and one option only, that is to travel by motor car, with all the economic, social and environmental consequences that entails.</P>
    <P>The Minister sought to fast track the planning process and increase the output of houses. He even introduced charges to deter the public from objecting to new developments. However, he did nothing to remove the single biggest cause of objections to new housing, which is the public fear that there will be increases in the level of congestion, and the public have every reason to fear it. It is an inevitable consequence of the failure to provide any public transport to match the increase in population and housing. As Minister with responsibility for housing and for the environment, the Minister has a responsibility to promote sustainable transport modes, and this measure goes nowhere towards achieving that. I reject this resolution as a fraud and as a deception of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on the method by which this proposed tax is introduced. It was announced in the budget on 6 December last. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government tells us that this motor tax is not a budgetary issue, not part of taxation policy generally. This kind of rhetoric rings hollow with motorists and those who have to pay this so called tax while being told that it is not a tax. Was the Minister trying to hide this tax by announcing it in the shadow of the budget, in the dark of night? Why did the Minister announce this measure, slipping it in when all the papers were put to bed and the Automobile Association and other bodies who comment on motoring issues and represent car owners had reacted positively to the budget? </P>
      <P>This has been described as a green tax in an effort to try to fool people and make them believe it is benefiting the environment in some way. This measure is purely a means of collecting funds for the Exchequer and it is misleading to contend that it is a green taxation measure under which different rates of tax will be applied depending on engine capacity.</P>
      <P>A car manufactured today can be up to 20 times cleaner in terms of emissions than a car manufactured 10 year ago. This is not reflected in this measure. Over the past 15 years the development of electronic injection systems, catalytic converters, multi-valve engines, exhaust gas accumulations and other new technologies have contributed to the manufacture of low emission passenger cars and light duty vehicle engines. These developments have led to significant improvements in air quality in other European countries, while continuing developments will further enhance air quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cars with these new technologies have a higher engine capacity. For example, a four litre diesel engine has lower emissions than a ten year old small car. However, this is not reflected in this measure which focuses on engine size and does <Col N="793" /> nothing to support new more environmentally friendly technologies. This measure does not give any incentive to motorists to purchase a new environmentally friendly car. The Minister is trying to sell this as a green taxation measure but he is not very convincing, particularly when one considers the number of cars imported from outside the EU which have higher emission levels and are not as environmentally friendly as some of the cars manufactured within the EU. I ask the Minister to consider the introduction of a measure which reflects the fact that emissions from older cars imported from outside the EU are contributing to poor air quality and damaging the environment. As a result of European directives and regulatory standards, a car manufactured today has 95% fewer emissions than a car manufactured during the 1970s. Since 1993 a number of emission directives have come into force, while many more are due to follow. These directives, when finalised, will enhance previous enactments.</P>
    <P>The money collected under this measure will go to the local government fund. Does the money collected each year go directly to the local government fund? We do not seem to see it and I would like to know where it goes. Under this measure approximately £400 million will be collected each year. This money could be used to solve the problems in regard to non-national roads. I have previously raised with the Minister the plight of corporation boroughs which have been hard done by. In my constituency the roads have been neglected. Some money has come on stream in the past year or two but it is slow and roads have deteriorated to an embarrassing level. The level of funding provided for roads in my local authority area does not reflect the number of road users.</P>
    <P>I will be parochial and raise a local issue of concern to me. Will the Minister on his next visit to Cork city take note of the quay walls which are collapsing? The embankment and road behind it are collapsing and much of the area has been fenced off as it is dangerous and not suitable for use by pedestrians. In recent years Cork Corporation has repeatedly requested the Department for funding to deal with this problem but it has not been forthcoming. Will the Minister consider this area which is an important amenity not only for Cork city but for the entire county?</P>
    <P>My colleague referred to public transport. One of our contributions to the environment should be to encourage greater use of public transport and to discourage people from using their cars. This measure means a further investment in motor vehicles and there will have to be a return on that. My objection to this tax is that it is being promoted as a green tax, which it is not. Rather it is purely a means of collecting more revenue for the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>Two promises won the 1977 election for Fianna Fáil &ndash; one was the promise to abolish road tax, while the other was the promise <Col N="794" /> to abolish domestic rates. It is ironic that 24 years later a Fianna Fáil Minister for the Environment and Local Government is proposing an increase in the reintroduced motor tax for a fund which will replace the fund which domestic rates had provided prior to their abolition in 1977.</P>
      <P>I will not quibble with the proposed increases as they are broadly in line with inflation. I cannot pretend that if those of us on this side of the House were on the opposite side we would be doing dramatically different in so far as the amount of road tax is concerned. However, the Minister is doing himself no service in trying to pretend that this is a form of green taxation. For example, it is ludicrous to think that because there will be £15 less in motor taxation on a taxi, hackney or public service vehicle that somebody will use it in preference to private transport or that because the amount of motor taxation on an 1100cc car is £4 or £5 less than it is on a 1600cc car that one will opt to buy a smaller vehicle for that reason alone.</P>
      <P>The reason the Minister is describing this as a green tax is that he was highly embarrassed at the time of the budget. I recall the time when hauliers took to the roads in protest and demanded a reduction in excise duty and in the taxation on motor fuels and the Minister declared publicly that there should not be a reduction in excise duty or in the taxation on motor fuels. I supported him publicly at the time, and I have no doubt that he argued for that position in Government. It was, therefore, a considerable humiliation for him when the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement reduced the excise duty on motor fuels. To take the bad look off it, in the dead of night he announced the green taxation &ndash; what would otherwise be the normal inflation related increases in motor taxation which all of us would be happy to go along with without much fuss.</P>
      <P>My concern is not the amount of the tax but its use. That reflects the concern of the motorist. The motorist will not lose a great deal of sleep tonight because there are a few extra pounds on motor taxation. Motorists are becoming increasingly agitated as to whether they are getting value for money for the motor taxation paid. Motor taxation now goes into the local government fund. When one looks at the way that fund is distributed one finds serious discrimination against those areas of the country which have the highest concentration of payers and also the highest concentration of new payers of the tax through new registrations. The local government fund for 2000 was not distributed on a purely <i>per capita</i> basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I accept other factors come into play. If one looks at it on a <i>per capita</i> basis it is very revealing. The lowest amounts of money were allocated to South Dublin County Council, £54.75 <i>per capita</i> last year, Galway city, £76, Waterford city, £79, Dublin city, £80, all of which are local authorities around the perimeter of major urban centres and which have the highest concentration of car owners and payers of motor tax. On the <Col N="795" /> other hand, given that County Leitrim, where I accept there are factors relating to length of roads, got £228.76, County Longford, £199.23, and County Roscommon, £172.98, an explanation must be given why the allocation <i>per capita</i> is three and four times the amount between one local authority and another.</P>
    <P>The allocation of this money is based on a per kilometre basis and no distinction is made between the kilometre of road which has a low usage in County Leitrim and the kilometre of road which has a high usage in the centre of an urban area. No allowance is made in urban areas for the provision of footpaths, more regular maintenance and cleaning of roads, public lighting and heavy traffic and that they are regularly dug up by utilities such as gas, electricity, Eircom and so on. There is a mismatch between those areas. The increases in the allocation in 2000 over 1999, based on a needs and resources study commissioned by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and carried out by Galway County Council, are close to inflation in the case of the large urban authorities. In Dublin city the increase was 7%, in South Dublin County Council it was 8%; in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council it was 8% but in Fingal County Council it was reduced by 7%. In Longford the increase was 22%, in Sligo it was 29%, in Laois it was 20%, in Kerry it was 20% and there are other examples.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look at the way the local government fund is distributed. That look has commenced through the commissioning of the needs and resources study by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. A review group comprised of professionals from a number of local authorities is looking at it. Following a request from me, the Minister agreed that he and his officials would come to a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government to explain how the local government fund is allocated and to discuss some better way of allocating that fund. It is not acceptable that the local government fund is allocated, in relation to roads, purely on a kilometre basis and in relation to other services, purely on physical criteria, such as social needs. In developing areas an increasing number of persons pay motor tax which is forming the core of the local government fund. Certainly moneys are provided through capital funding for sewerage, water, roads and, in some cases, community services but no fund is provided for the continuing cost of maintaining and managing those services. No consideration is given to the social needs of those areas and they were not factored into the needs and resources study carried out by Galway County Council.</P>
    <P>Motor taxation is an environmental tax and is a tax on motor ownership. It is used by the local government system primarily for environmental purposes. This is as it should be. The problem is that those who pay the tax are entitled to ques<Col N="796" /> tion why the housing estates in which they live, where roads and footpaths have deteriorated dramatically in the past 20 or 30 years because of increased usage of motor cars, do not get a sufficient slice of the local government fund to maintain and manage those services. Why is it that social needs are not taken into account in the distribution of this fund? There is an urgent need to review the way in which the local government fund is allocated. While I accept the preparatory work would be undertaken by experts, professionals and so on, the review should not be conducted behind closed doors. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should take whatever recommendations are made to him by the review group and bring them before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government to be debated so that there is a democratic input into the way the local government fund, made up of money collected from motorists, is distributed with a view to making the best possible use of that money. This would ensure a better relationship between this tax on private motoring and the impact of private motoring on our roads and the general environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In paragraph (3)<i>(a) </i>of the motion, to delete subparagraph <i>(b)</i> of the paragraph proposed to be substituted.</P>
      <P>I shall speak about the amendments later. The Green Party is more than happy to support fiscal measures which encourage sustainability and the Government has often referred to such measures. The Minister for Finance in his first budget referred to a tax on benefit in kind for parking spaces in Dublin. He hinted that certain civil servants complained about this proposed measure. It was dropped and has not been heard of since. Likewise there has been much debate about eco-taxes and energy taxes but none has been imposed. I have raised the proposal for a tax on plastic bags on numerous occasions in the House.</P>
      <P>However, we must understand the concept of the eco-tax. It is based on &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle but it goes beyond that. Eco-taxes are also about encouraging people. Incentives are needed in conjunction with taxes. That is why the question of usage is important. If one does not create waste, one should not pay. In other words, a flat rate for waste charges is of no benefit. People will fill bins up because their attitude is, since they are paying for the service they might as well use it. However, if the charges were volume or weight-related, people would be encouraged to recycle, which is what is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are also required to use their cars less. The financial resolution could be described as a green measure at a stretch but it would be better if people used their cars less. Deputy Clune referred to clean engine technology. COf7&gt;2 emissions increase in tandem with the increase in the volume of cars. Carbon dioxide levels increase <Col N="797" /> with the use of certain technologies, such as the lean burn engine, which has been effective in reducing certain pollutants. There is a problem in terms of their contribution to greenhouse gases. Technology does not resolve the problem. Better public transport and less car usage is required.</P>
    <P>The problem with the Minister's proposals is that he will tax the electric bicycle. The electric bicycle is an extremely green proposition. It is a fantastic measure and it is the way of the future. I cannot understand why the Minister is introducing this proposal and that is the reason we have tabled amendments. We hope the other Opposition parties will support us. I use a regular bicycle but I used an electric bicycle for a week. It takes four hours to charge. For example, Deputy Gilmore could use one to travel to the House from Dún Laoghaire. It operates as an ordinary bicycle but if one is travelling up a hill one can switch over to electric power. It is attractive to the business sector for business men who do not want to arrive in work covered in perspiration and the bicycle is also ideal for commuters. Taxing it flies in the face of sustainability.</P>
    <P>The Minister may refer to the definition in the Finance Act, 1992, but the Government needs to get its act together and delete it. Electric bicycles should not be covered by motor taxation. That is not the way of the future. We should not tax solar panels, electric bicycles and so on. That is why the Green Party objects to the resolution. People can argue that electricity is used if one charges the bicycle. However, Eirtricity is a new electricity company which derives energy from renewable resources such as wind. Soon people will be able to obtain electricity from the company and they will be able to charge their bicycles using wind energy. That is an exciting prospect and it is a way to reduce COf7&gt;2 emissions properly. A Government with common sense would want to encourage more people to use such bicycles rather than cars.</P>
    <P>The use of motor taxation revenue to fund local government is not a sustainable option in the long term. We need to return to using rates for this. Local authorities cannot depend on revenue from cars. As car numbers dwindle, there will be less revenue. In future we want fewer cars. Countries such as Holland, which have a high volume of cars but lower car usage, are in transition. Shortly, there will be less car ownership because driving a car is becoming less viable. If one travels to countries such as Holland at the weekends the motorways are clogged up. In the long term we must move away from using motor taxation revenue in this manner.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will look to the future and take on board what the Green Party is saying. He may be able to persuade the mandarins in the Department of Finance who do not have even the greenest tinge and do not understand the concept of hypothecation and how important it is to use fiscal measures to encourage sustainability. I hope, for instance, the Minister will meet the committee on green taxation which is supposed <Col N="798" /> to come up with recommendations. Nothing is happening. If the committee had examined this issue, I would have hoped it would have recognised the sense of what the Green Party proposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the measure would come up again in three months. Perhaps he will have the opportunity to examine our comments. The manner in which the traffic problem and air pollution has worsened dramatically in recent times and car ownership has increased exponentially means we will have to examine such measures. PM 10s, which are volatile organic compounds, cause asthma and high incidences of cancer in our cities. There have been alarming levels of these pollutants in my constituency, including along Pearse Street. We must examine more sustainable methods of dealing with society's problems.</P>
    <P>We must examine planning in the long term but that is for another day. I urge the Minister to consider the amendments. I hope the other Opposition parties will accept them because we must signal that taxing electric bicycles is not the way forward. I have spoken to officials in the Department of the Environment and Local Government and in the Revenue. There has been a suggestion that electric bicycles should be insured. That would be the wrong road to take. They will not cause accidents. They are ordinary bicycles which travel at approximately 11 miles per hour. It is the way of the future and I hope the Minister takes my comments on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the financial resolution for a number of reasons. I will highlight two issues, which the Minister has neglected. First, he announced that he will exempt mountain and cave rescue vehicles so that all emergency vehicles are exempt from motor tax but he did not refer to sub-aqua teams. The waterways in the midlands are extensive and there is a huge reliance on the services of sub-aqua teams. They provide an excellent service with little funding. Many are voluntary, including Athlone and Rosommon sub-aqua teams. The vast majority of suicides result from drowning. The sub-aqua team is the first organisation to be contacted. In many cases it is not possible for the Garda sub-aqua team to be present at all searches because of the number of demands placed on it. The voluntary organisations, which are trained in search and rescue, are called in and can be mobilised at very short notice. For example, the River Shannon, one of the busiest waterways in Europe, has a number of voluntary sub-aqua organisations along it which can be called upon at very short notice if there is an accident or fatality. Sub-aqua clubs are unique voluntary organisations. Their vehicles are not full-time emergency vehicles, but they provide a very important service on a shoestring budget in many cases and I ask the Minister to exempt those vehicles from motor tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Electrical vehicles were mentioned by the Minister and Deputy Gormley. I wish to raise rape seed oil, a renewable fuel which should be <Col N="799" /> promoted and encouraged. Farming is going through a difficult time and the country is subject to volatility in terms of oil markets. We have the potential to develop cash crops such as rape seed given our climate and I do not see why we should not be the leading country in developing this technology. Maxol has done much work in this area, but neither the financial resolutions in relation to excise duty which were tabled in the House on 6 December nor the resolution we are now discussing address this issue. I ask the Minister to look again at this as the only way we will encourage the development of these technologies and the use of rape seed oil is through incentivisation in terms of excise and motor tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that &ldquo;these operations cover a wide range of programmes for which local authorities have responsibility, such as housing, roads, water and sewerage, planning, the natural environment, recreation and amenities and community development&rdquo;. Deputy Gilmore highlighted the fact that the amount of funding for Roscommon is quite generous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>And the roads are not great either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just about to make that point. The roads are in a deplorable state. We have more kilometres of road per head of population than any other county and all the funding we get from this budget goes into the road infrastructure. There is nothing left for the other elements mentioned by the Minister. We can only avail of direct grants from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. There is no point talking about giving additional powers to local authorities unless we have the money to make the decisions required. Every time I raise issues like this with the Minister through parliamentary questions I am told about the discretionary fund we receive, which is a pittance. Once it is divided between the six electoral areas in my county it amounts to very little. We cannot tackle housing, water and sewerage or ensure proper investment in our roads as we do not have the resources to employ the staff, get the equipment or carry out work.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will respond to some of the issues I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions. As I said at the outset, we will have an opportunity to tease out some more of the issues in greater detail when the Bill comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Naughten raised the issues of renewable fuels and sub-aqua clubs. There is a list of exempted vehicles and sub-aqua club vehicles might possibly come under it. Many sub-aqua club activities do not relate to emergencies but are recreational and social. However, the issue merits consideration between now and the intro<Col N="800" /> duction of the Bill, and perhaps the Deputy will get somebody to make a formal submission or make a submission himself and we will examine it. Sub-aqua clubs do very valuable work, no more than the Civil Defence with which I was associated for many years, and they deserve some recognition.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the amendments tabled by Deputy Gormley which I do not propose to accept for a few reasons. I have no argument with the case made by him that these are much more environmentally friendly, etc., but motor tax applies to all mechanically propelled vehicles, irrespective of how the vehicle is propelled. Since motor tax is now an important part of the local government fund and is distributed to local authorities to finance their activities, I am not in favour of exempting any kind of mechanically propelled vehicle. Also, the Deputy may have said that I was introducing a tax. In fact, all electrically propelled vehicles are currently liable to motor tax. Therefore, I am not proposing the introduction of a new tax. I have no difficulty with the principle of keeping motor tax on environmentally friendly vehicles to a minimum and that is reflected in the increases in motor tax.</P>
    <P>People have said I referred to this as a green tax, but motor tax is not a green tax. I said that in relation to the changes I have made over the past number of years I am attempting to green the motor tax system a little more. My desire, and that of those who have spoken this afternoon, is to rebalance the motor tax system on that basis when we have the data on COf7&gt;2 emissions from cars under EU directives &ndash; we do not manufacture cars and are somewhat dependent on EU directives.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael and its former leader have accused me of issuing figures in the dead of night. Where I come from, 6.15 p.m. is not the dead of night &ndash; for me and most Deputies it is about half way through the day. I cannot help it if newspapers do not print the figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore made a number of valuable points. I am sure that if motor tax had a <i>per capita</i> basis, Deputy Gilmore would complain it was not a per kilometre basis.</P>

      <P>In page 5, between lines 29 and 90, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9) Any information given by a person pursuant to a request or requirement under subsection (8) shall not be admissible in criminal proceedings against that person (other than proceedings under subsection (14)(<i>c</i>)(i)).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert a new subsection. There is a corpus of law at European Convention level and at Supreme Court level here on this. Obviously an inquiry can be made by an authorised officer of the Minister, which I accept, and one can extract information from people, which was confirmed by the Supreme Court in the NIB case. It can also be an offence not to comply with requirements not to supply information.</P>
      <P>However, one cannot use the evidence extracted in proceedings against a person. This is privilege against self-incrimination, which I am anxious for the Minister to examine. I am willing to withdraw the amendment if the Minister shares my understanding that this reflects the current state of the law. If he does not I will have to press the amendment, as information extracted cannot subsequently be used in criminal proceedings. If that is correct and the Minister agrees then this is a declaratory amendment; it would be superfluous and I would not press it. However, if he does not I will press it because I want to ensure we are in compliance with European law. Considerable protections under laws passed here are being done away with and I am not happy with that. I want to ensure my amendment is declaratory, as is the current position and as some of his officials will understand, and that being the case I will not press the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 41, after &ldquo;liable&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in damages&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment also seeks clarification. With respect to those who drafted the legislation, &ldquo;any proceedings&rdquo; is too wide. The judicial review remedy should lie against any authorised officer. It is as simple as that. If we took the literal interpretation, as opposed to the schematic or teleological interpretation, we should realise that under the recent treatise on statutory interpretation from the Law Reform Commission that everything said in the House will be taken on face value by the courts. That is a new departure, as my colleague Christopher Doyle and others can tell us. If an authorised officer is in the process of clearing out a farm and the farmer is aggrieved, obviously the farmer could seek an injunction. If one interpreted section 13 literally, the literal interpretation is that that would not be the situation and that this would be restricted.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, this provision confers complete immunity, including immunity from judicial review and is far wider than intended. It is greater than the powers the Minister would have, as the Minister could be brought up before the courts in relation to this but it puts an authorised officer on a par with the President. Obviously one can grant immunity from torts, which I am not disputing, but this provision is too wide and I urge the Minister to examine what I am saying carefully, as it is submitted in a constructive fashion. While the exemption from or immunity in tort can lie in relation to an authorised officer, this is too wide and &ldquo;in damages&rdquo; would solve many of the problems here by restricting the provision enough. Every administrative decision can be subjected to judicial review and if one interpreted this provision literally it would restrict that right. It could well be interpreted as restricting a person's right to proceed by way of injunction in a civil case. I seek clarification of this.</P>

We are seeking that the legislation remain in force until the expiration of six months from the date of its passing&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I have no wish to interrupt Deputy Penrose but can we clarify what we are doing? I have the list of amendments &ndash; the paper is green &ndash; which I received some minutes ago. Amendment No. 3 refers to line 48 on page 6 in section 2. It deals with the length of the term of imprisonment that may be imposed on summary conviction. I want to be sure that all Members have the same list of amendments. I <Col N="804" /> received this list 20 minutes ago and if there is a more recent list, I would like to get it. The debate could be adjourned until all Members have the same list of amendments.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I could be helpful. Amendment No. 3 states: &ldquo;In page 6, line 48, to delete &lsquo;12' and substitute &lsquo;6'.&rdquo; My understanding of the amendment is that Deputy Penrose believes 12 months is too long a term in relation to section 17(f2&gt;a) and he wishes to reduce it from 12 to six months.</P>
      <P>However, amendment No. 9, in the names of Deputies Dukes, Crawford, Connaughton and Sheehan, refers to the Bill and not just to section 17(f2&gt;a). It provides that the &ldquo;Act shall lapse and cease&rdquo;. That is my understanding of the difference between the two amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my understanding too. Why is the Minister proposing 12 months? Why would it take 12 months to deal with some of the extraordinary powers that are being provided for in this Bill? This is an important insertion into the principal Act. Will a consolidated Bill be brought forward rather than making piecemeal insertions into the Act?</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Dukes's amendment. Why should it take 12 months to find out whether the extraordinary measures being introduced are necessary or require modification or strengthening? They might need to be strengthened in relation to matters that might evolve or unfold over the next six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>My proposal is to telescope the procedure further. It is extremely optimistic to think we might be able to look at this issue again, having put it behind us, early in June. At this time, there is no realistic prospect that we can expect to be out of the woods, so to speak, by June. That is not meant as a criticism but to point out that, given the situation in the UK at present, it is not a likelihood.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Penrose that we need to examine this again in a more relaxed climate. There are provisions in the Bill that make everybody a little uneasy and we will discuss them later. My experience of emergency legislation has been rather bad. Only two emergency measures in the past 20 years have worked well. The others did not appear to have much effect and a couple proved useless, mainly because they were a response to a mood at a particular time without any sense of perspective. It was a case of rushing in to get ahead of popular opinion, public perception or the then fashionable notion of political correctness. That is not a good way to legislate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister agrees with the point we are making but there is no reason to wait a year. I do not know if anybody is in a position to make a judgment on this. I hope, however, that by the time six months have passed it will be realistic to <Col N="805" /> look again at wartime measures in peacetime, as it were, and judge them. Some measures in the Bill will continue to have effect in peacetime. There is, for example, a system of regulation of dealers. I am not arguing against it but it would be useful to examine it again at a less fraught time. There is also, of course, provision for the 30 day retention rule which would not apply in peacetime, although many people fear it could apply permanently. My interpretation is that it would not. When this crisis is over we will be in a position to consider whether that measure was effective.</P>
    <P>While my proposed date of 1 June is excessively optimistic, the Minister's proposal of 12 months is excessively lax. In those circumstances, we might find a consensus around the territory proposed by Deputy Penrose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that this is emergency legislation has been well made. As legislators in a democracy we must be extremely careful and I accept the two Deputies' comments in that regard. In fact, I have occasionally initiated legislation in the Seanad to encourage public debate as well as debate in the House. That is most worthwhile. Debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas and among the public results in better legislation.</P>
      <P>In this case, the Office of the Attorney General was asked only a few days ago to draft legislation. This legislation was passed by the Government on Tuesday and we will enact it on Thursday. I agree with the Deputies and support the amendments accepted in the Seanad that the legislation be reviewed. The question is how soon that review should take place.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose's amendment suggests a review regarding authorised officers while Deputy Dukes's amendment concerns a review of the entire legislation and in a shorter time &ndash; up to 1 June. There is no doubt that authorised officers are being given extraordinary powers which would not be tolerated in peace time. One would not need to be a civil libertarian to find the powers objectionable as they are very wide ranging. However, at the height of the hysteria a few days ago, the demand was for even more draconian powers.</P>
      <P>When the national herd and the economy are under threat, substantial powers and penalties are required if someone is questioned and refuses to co-operate or leaves the jurisdiction, as happened in this case. In such circumstances it is difficult to trace from where the disease is coming.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes noted that there are welcome provisions in the Bill which needed to be introduced for some time. There was chicanery involving switching of tags and I remember a time when people kept tags in the boots of their cars. Some people took pride in their efficiency at removing and replacing tags. There is no place for that kind of activity in the industry. We have an agreement with the social partners on the introduction of sheep tagging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> Dealers are required given the nature of our system of cattle and livestock production where some animals are sold as drop calves, stores or finishers and where the live trade involves more than 400,000 animals per year. We do not wish to unduly disrupt that business but this crisis has highlighted a problem. Some people, for example, buy sheep in Carlisle, as in this instance, which are taken to Nothern Ireland for processing. The animals never arrive at the processing plant but are taken to what might be called a depot, the tags are switched, the animals are taken into the Republic where they are kept at another depot or farm for some time. Much illegality, smuggling or whatever one wants to call it, is going on.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to trace sheep from a factory, farm or depot. One is talking about a small number of dealers. The Bill proposes to register these dealers and put some order on the situation. That is a good idea as is the suggestion regarding tagging. This section of the Bill will be worthwhile but it will need refining. The question is when that refining will take place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes rightly stated that we do not know what the extent of the crisis will be or how long it will last. We can only go on previous experience. The last outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain lasted up to eight months. I hope that will not be the case on this occasion but we are not in a position to say, given that the disease is rampant in Britain. The largest number of new cases were announced yesterday which were geographically spread throughout the country.</P>
    <P>If one accepts that it will take six months, it is desirable to have some period of calm or peace after that in which to review the legislation. Some of the provisions may prove over the top, some might not be used as they were introduced in the hysteria of the moment. However, other provisions will be worthwhile and will work out well.</P>
    <P>Twelve months is a reasonable period. I do not want too long a period as I accept the principle of a time limit. We have decided on 12 months as we do not know how long the outbreak will last &ndash; we hope it will only be for a short time. Deciding on a short period of three or six months could cause difficulties. For example, some situations in which authorised officers track down dealers who are behaving illegally are very complex. In some cases animals are entered in one person's name, paid for in another person's name, bought, sold and resold and the investigations can easily take up to six months. Bringing cases to court could easily take seven or eight months and that is why I have suggested 12 months. I do not wish to elongate the period more than necessary. I accept that the legislation needs a thorough review and that is why I will insist on 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>The authorised officers are being given very strong powers and this issue will have to be monitored. I do not wish to give the impression that because people are being given powers they have not had before they will not <Col N="807" /> use them properly. I hope these powers will be properly used. However, I am concerned that they will be on the Statute Book where they are likely to remain for a substantial period.</P>
      <P>I am not sure whether the Garda, Customs and Excise or the Revenue have some of the powers being given to authorised officers. We are talking about people who have no training or experience in the use of such powers. This is a dangerous situation.</P>
      <P>More technical matters will be raised later. The powers being given to authorised officers are draconian and I fail to see why the situation cannot be reviewed in six months. I will not make an issue of this as other Members will have much to say about this matter. However, six months would appear to be the correct period if there is something fundamentally wrong. After six months one would have an idea of how the situation would develop.</P>
      <P>Other provisions in the Bill will create havoc from an administrative point of view unless they are well thought out. I hope mechanisms will be implemented to ensure people are treated fairly. We want to root out the rogues who do not do their jobs whether they are farmers, dealers, agents or sloppy administrators, at whatever level. Perhaps 99% of people involved are fine, decent, law-abiding people. The Bill is welcome in that it will license, control and monitor all movements. However, I have serious reservations about how this will be administered, where the power will lie, who will use it and who will make the decisions on the ground. I agree with my colleagues that the sooner we return to the House to review the legislation the better, in case anything goes dramatically wrong. That is why I thought the Minister and his officials would accept that six months would have been the correct period after which to review the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that once authorised officers have been appointed and given their warrants they will be in control. I am extremely anxious about this type of legislation being left on the Statute Book for too long. I have had experience in other areas where people with similar powers seem to deal unreasonably with ordinary people. The enacted legislation should be reviewed at the earliest possible date so that if problems arise we will be able to deal with them. Rogue dealers should be dealt with in the strongest possible way, but we must make sure that over-zealous individuals do not make this situation very difficult for ordinary people who do not need draconian methods to force them to co-operate fully with the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the issue of tags and during my long apprenticeship in a farm organisation I recall bringing departmental personnel to Northern Ireland to examine how the system worked there. It is completely unrealistic for us still to issue cards. People are writing out cards <Col N="808" /> and passing them back and forth like yo-yo's all over the place. Earlier this week the Minister introduced a permit system under which every animal has to be moved. I cannot understand how such a system can be introduced in an emergency, yet cannot be brought in for normal trading.</P>
    <P>Problems can arise when tags and cards do not match up. The Minister may claim the new tagging system is better but I can guarantee that cattle dealers are able to circumvent it. They only have to send down to Bandon for a replacement tag and who knows to what animal that ID will relate, or whether it is from the North or the Republic? While that may appear to be a minor point, it certainly poses a genuine problem.</P>
    <P>Last but by no means least, we have the sheep tagging debacle. On television recently, the Minister said he had a great relationship with the farm organisations and everything was working out well. His junior Minister has put it on the record, however, that sheep tagging was not introduced earlier because of difficulties with farming organisations. The Minister should clearly state what the situation is. He said he had obtained agreement from the national farming organisations to introduce sheep tagging from 1 March, but he also admitted he was not sure what type of tags were involved. To monitor the position by means of this legislation, we must ensure that sheep are tagged so we know what is happening. In light of this, the legislation should be reviewed at the earliest possible date. We are seeking a situation whereby the legislation can be reconfirmed by the House, if necessary. That would afford us an opportunity for debate in a calmer, less trenchant manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>While I know what the Minister is seeking, we must take cognisance of the extraordinary powers we are investing in certain people, either under the new section 17A or in the overall provisions of the Bill. Some of the powers are extremely necessary and I hope they will be successfully implemented. However, we may have cause to worry about a number of measures in the legislation when we consider them over the next few days. Most of us have had less than 48 hours to consider the Bill, yet we have done our best in trying circumstances.</P>
      <P>Section 3(3) specifies a period of 30 days during which a person who purchases an animal may not sell or move that animal from his or her lands, save under permit.</P>
      <P>Section 3(4) states:</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) shall have effect only during such period and in respect of the whole of or such part or parts of the State as may be specified by the Minister by order, where he or she considers it reasonably necessary to avoid the outbreak or spread of the disease or diseases of a particular class or description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to insert the words &ldquo;and only in exceptional circumstances&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;. People do not want the 30-day <Col N="809" /> period to become the norm, but that is what happens when such measures are written into legislation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister or an officer of the Minister may issue a permit to a person or dealer, or a class of person or dealer permitting an animal to be sold or supplied within the period referred to in subsection (3).</P>
    <P>As Deputy Connaughton, who probably has more expertise in this area than anybody else, has said, there are hundreds of legitimate dealers who help out, including people who bring calves up from the south and others who bring stores from the west to the midlands for fattening. They are all operating legitimately to earn a shilling in the proper way.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his introduction that a small minority has acted irresponsibly and illegally, and those are the people upon whom the legislation is focusing. Dealers will now be registered so the Department will know everything about them if they are given permits in advance. If the Minister does not do so, however, it will stall the movement of animals, irrespective of how quickly the Minister thinks permits can be issued. Many dairy farmers are earning good money in the Minister's own part of the country, thank God, unlike beef farmers in the midlands. People may bring suckler calves from the mart or farm on a Wednesday evening, and they want to deliver them as quickly as possible because of the problems that can arise when cows are calving. Will the permit regulations affect such deliveries? I know the Minister is attempting to deal with this matter but I am trying to point out, in a constructive rather than a confrontational manner, the necessity for ensuring that whatever measures are introduced are sensible and reasonable. Apart from the nature of some of the measures envisaged in the legislation, their practicality is also important.</P>
    <P>In fairness, the Minister made it very clear and focused on the fact that he did not want to disrupt normal trading activities. The transport of suckler calves is a normal trading activity, however, so perhaps the Minister's officials have a view on that. There is a difficulty in perceiving a person applying for a permit for one animal, yet subsection (5) refers to &ldquo;permitting an animal to be sold or supplied within the period&rdquo; that is specified. Those are the problems that may arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister will work out the permit regulations with the relevant organisations, but that is why I want the legislation to be subject to review because there will be teething problems and issues we have missed. Neither I nor my colleague, Deputy Dukes, will harangue the Minister over the coming months. We will reluctantly accept the 12 month period. If there are teething problems of this nature in primary legislation it can become rooted, or cast in stone and 12 months later there can be significant disruption of normal everyday trading activity between the <Col N="810" /> various geographic areas of the country. In the circumstances, I am not pressing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy Penrose on the longer term implications. Whenever this Bill is reviewed, subsequent to its enactment, and bearing in mind that it is inserted into the Principal Act, the House should not be precluded, in such a review, from having regard to any other part of the Principal Act which is not affected by this Bill. I feel sure the Minister will agree that if, during the autumn session or some other time within the next year, it emerges that any particular provision of this Bill is causing a problem for cattle trading activities or disrupting the normal pattern, we should then have liberty to come back to the Minister on the matter, even in advance of a full review of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Based on experience with other emergency legislation, I am concerned that measures which may seem reasonable, adequate and proper at the height of a crisis can sometimes prove to be rather inappropriate when the heat of battle has died down and normality has been restored. In retrospect, one might then wonder why such measures had ever been introduced in the first instance. I personally have often found it useful to consider how a given problem and the proposed response to it might appear on looking back, perhaps three years later. A concern which seems most important today could appear very inconsequential in three years time. Of course, the converse could also apply.</P>
      <P>If the Minister can agree to an understanding such as I have outlined, I would be prepared, on that basis, to go along with a 12 month review of the arrangements now proposed. It would be very useful if we could agree, all other things being equal and there being no general election in the meantime, to make provision for discussing this matter again in March 2002. Of course, if there is a general election, matters will be much better anyhow, so that is not a worry. However, if we proceed on the basis of discussing this in March of next year, it would also be advisable, some time before Christmas, to have a review involving a forum of the people who are most involved in the situation, to look at the measures which are being implemented now and to consider their impact on the industry.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the debate I illustrated a number of deficiencies, as I described them. I appreciate that this term may have caused the Minister some indigestion. I referred to several difficulties which have occurred, including those with agricultural contractors. It is clear that some people have not taken the disinfection arrangements seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparation for a review of this legislation in March of next year, the relevant issues could usefully be examined, say in November or early December, in a forum with the farming organisations, the trade bodies, the agricultural contractors, the meat industry, and perhaps even some politicians. A similar forum which I ran on BSE recently proved to be a very worthwhile exercise. <Col N="811" /> We need to get as rounded a view as possible of how the arrangements have worked out in practice so that our subsequent review of this legislation can be based on an informed judgment of what changes may be needed at that stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It now appears that it is the Minister's intention that the review date will be 12 months hence. I expect that, over the next couple of months, public discussion will not actually concentrate on the role of the authorised officers, who will evidently be dealing with certain specific areas and individuals. Instead, there will be a much more fundamental discussion about the impact of this Bill on the lives of all farmers.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise some questions with the Minister on section 3. I agree with Deputy Penrose that the inclusion of the words &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; is most important. That will give a signal that the situation will not be treated lightly under any set of circumstances. With regard to the 30 day retention period&mdash;</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers will ask many questions about the 30 day retention period. As I understand it, a person who is defined as a dealer and who buys in cattle must hold them for 30 days. The section then goes on to provide for exceptions. I assume that the definitions in this Bill are compatible with those contained in the Bill dealing with traceability which was previously before this House. I will give four examples to illustrate the point which I wish to make. Will a calf dealer in County Galway who attends a mart in the south of the country on a Monday morning, purchases animals with his own money and transports them back to Mount Bellew be allowed to continue to operate? Under what circumstances might he be prevented from operating? Before that dealer travels to the south, will he be entitled to deal under a licence? Will such a licence allow him to travel south to purchase the cattle or will he be obliged to apply for a licence for every animal he buys? This is a technical and important matter because the dealer will not know how many calves will be available for purchase when he arrives at the mart. He will buy as many as possible, but he will not be sure <Col N="812" /> of the number of customers he will have for them when he returns to Mount Bellew.</P>
      <P>Let us consider another example. What will be the position of a part-time farmer who asks a dealer to buy his 20 cattle because he does not have time to go to the mart? Will the dealer be allowed to pay the mart manager for the cattle or will the farmer's cheque be used? There are subtle differences involved between these two examples. There are agents who call to farmers, buy cattle with their own money and transport them directly to a factory. In addition, there are factory agents who travel to farms, identify the cattle they wish to purchase and transport them directly to a factory. What sort of licence will these agents be obliged to hold?</P>
      <P>What will be the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> a feeder in southern Italy who sends an order to Ireland for 1,000 or 2,000 special Limousin cattle, all 300 kilos in weight, for delivery within two weeks? How will the traders, agents and dealers responsible for supplying such cattle operate under licence? Surely they will not be obliged to obtain a licence or certificate for each individual animal. Many dealers buy animals for the export trade and agents attending dairy sales are often asked to buy cows for farmers. Will these individuals be allowed to continue to do so?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate who will be allowed to operate under licence and who will not be allowed to do so? I am referring to reputable dealers who have never had any trouble with the authorities. There is no need to mention unscrupulous people. I am referring to people of good reputation who make a living out of buying and selling cattle. Will the Minister indicate how the people to whom I refer will be allowed to operate from tomorrow morning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to distract the Minister from answering Deputy Connaughton's questions. However, I wish to ask a number of questions about some of the provisions in this section.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate what is meant by the reference to appointing a &ldquo;class of persons&rdquo; as authorised officers? It is proposed to issue authorised officers with warrants. I do not know whether I am banging my head against a stone wall because I have tried to make the following suggestion in respect of previous legislation but made no headway. Will the Minister indicate if he intends to include photographs of authorised officers on warrants? These people are going to be conferred with some extraordinary powers and they will be presenting themselves at farms and other premises and relying on their right of entry and right of search in order to do their job. Regardless of what we think of the activities of certain individuals, these people are entitled to be able to satisfy themselves that the person before them is who and what he or she claims to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not envisage a situation where, as in a gangster movie, an official will be obliged, like a <Col N="813" /> member of the LAPD, to flash his or her identity card. However, a person who is confronted by an authorised officer of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, who has at their disposal the full majesty of the law, is entitled to be able to satisfy himself or herself that the officer is who the warrant indicates them to be. They could do so if a photograph was included on the warrant. If we can put photographs on ballot papers at election time, surely we have reached the stage where members of the public can check the bona fides of officers, acting on behalf of the State, who are responsible for implementing the provisions, as in this instance, of quite draconian legislation. People must be able to satisfy themselves that authorised officers are who they represent themselves to be.</P>
    <P>Section 2(11) authorises officers to use reasonable force while section 2(12) provides that &ldquo;An authorised officer when exercising any powers under this section may be accompanied by other persons&rdquo; and may confiscate equipment. I am assuming that the Bill has been drafted with care. However, it must be noted that the &ldquo;other persons&rdquo; accompanying an authorised officer are not, themselves, authorised officers. I am sure it would have been overtly stated that they are authorised officers if that was the intention. Authorised officers will now be able to appear, as do agents of the sheriffs, and they will be able to bring people with them to help them carry out their work. Is that the intention? If it is, it is doubly important, in the interests of the rights of citizens, that authorised officers have a warrant which includes a photograph and an indication that he or she is entitled to use other persons to help carry out the necessary work.</P>
    <P>I am not stating that this will arise in a great many cases. However, the Minister is aware that there are instances where authorised officers operating on the basis of legislation of this nature &ndash; I refer here to operations against people selling drugs for use on animals or those who use them &ndash; can get involved in situations which become quite fraught. These officers require support and that is why there are usually gardaí present. I would be concerned about authorised officers, with extensive and wide ranging powers, travelling around the county with groups of people, entering premises and enforcing the provisions of this section. I wish to be assured that a degree of accountability will attach and that this will not be done in a way that is unnecessarily confrontational.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, the aim of which is to protect genuine dealers and the farming community. Like Deputy Connaughton, I am concerned about a number of issues. The first of these involves situations where people are exporting calves. In my county, dairy farmers usually transport their calves to the exporter's yard where they are loaded onto large containers. This avoids the necessity of having large container trucks trying to gain access to farms <i>via</i> narrow <Col N="814" /> roads. Many dairy farmers in County Meath have contacted me since last night to voice their concerns about this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton also referred to genuine dealers who travel to the south to buy beef breeds. On their return, they travel from farm to farm selling the cattle they have purchased. This form of trade has been going on for as long as I can remember and a similar trade exists in respect of store cattle. Those are some of the concerns but I am sure they will not inhibit the genuine dealer. It is the rogue dealers we all want to stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am transfixed by the definition of &ldquo;dealers&rdquo;. There is a definition problem with the section. Section 29A of the Principal Act states that a dealer is a person who purchases an animal or poultry and sells or supplies the animal or poultry to another person. In my view it should read &ldquo;or sells&rdquo; an animal or poultry to another person. It further states that the Minister may by order provide for the approval and registration of dealers and dealers' premises. If I purchase an animal for the purpose of reselling it and I keep it on my premises for that purpose, I do not become a dealer under this definition until after I have sold it to someone else within the 45 days of purchase. At that stage the animal has left my premises. Do I now have to apply for the approval and registration of myself and my premises even though this is a once off transaction and I will never be a dealer again? I can only satisfy the definition after the event, which is very unusual. If I enter into a transaction once, I am apparently a dealer forever and my premises are dealers' premises. That cannot be what the Minister intends. It would be more accurate to describe a dealer as someone who is in the business of acquiring and disposing of animals, otherwise than in the normal conduct of the trade of farming. The Revenue Commissioners have no difficulty identifying the trade of dealing as a trade separate from that of farming.</P>
      <P>I want to highlight another problem, one which I am sure the Minister did not intend. Cats, dogs, guinea pigs, hamsters and rabbits are listed as falling within the definition of &ldquo;animal&rdquo; set out in Part I of the First Schedule of the 1966 Act.</P>

    <P>Deputy Connaughton raised a number of issues. The exceptional circumstances should be examined to reinforce the emergency nature of the legislation &ndash; that is in section 3(4). We must ensure that we are putting the best possible wording in the legislation until such time as we have an opportunity to review it in the 12 months from the passage of the Bill. While some of these matters might sound flippant, we can get bogged down in this area. There is no doubt that some<Col N="815" /> body will exercise their right to test the legislation in the courts to see if it impugns various constitutional provisions or whatever, and that is their right, but the Minister should examine that, particularly the definition of &ldquo;dealer&rdquo; which I set out. It might sound farfetched but it should be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have high regard for Deputy Penrose and I know that as a socialist he would never want to be a dealer because after all, Sir, as you know, it was the dealing men from Crossmaglen who &ldquo;put the whiskey in me tea&rdquo;. I would warn Deputy Penrose against buying any of the following animals in case he might become a dealer &ndash; agoutis, beavers, capybara, chinchillas, ferrets, fitches &ndash; I am skipping a few &ndash; porcupines and prairie dogs. Deputy Penrose should not buy one of those animals for one of his children, get tired of it and sell it within 45 days or he will be a dealer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their interventions which were most helpful. This is emergency legislation. It is tough legislation and under normal circumstances it would not be desirable to have tough legislation like this enacted in a couple of days. That is why there is a provision that it be reviewed after 12 months. I agreed with the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, going to the Seanad yesterday to have this done by consensus. I told him that if there were any reasonable amendments put forward he should accept them, and he did, and I told my officials that the interpretation should be as generous as possible.</P>
      <P>Some good ideas have been put forward in relation to this legislation. Unlike Deputy Dukes I do not have a bound copy but I have the 1966 Act here and the entire Act should come up in the review, not just the sections inserted into it. The idea of a forum is a good one because we have operated by consensus for the past ten or 11 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with a number of specific matters. The 30 days limit will only apply where there is disease or risk of a disease and a permit arrangement will come into effect for people who wish to trade under those circumstances. We talked about the permit that is currently in existence, which is simple and works quite well. It was introduced because if a garda stopped a truck, the person could produce the permit which would have information such as the number of cattle, sheep or whatever, where he got them and where they were going. The details will be discussed again with the social partners and with interested people before it is drawn up and it will cover the detailed and complicated situation Deputy Connaughton raised. This will ensure that the system will be flexible, that it will work and allow the industry to operate smoothly. If it does not, it will <Col N="816" /> cause absolute disruption because in this kind of industry a great deal of flexibility is required. We do not have an integrated system like those in other countries so it will have to allow for that.</P>
    <P>In relation to dealers, I will be making an order approving the registration of dealers and their premises under section 3(2)(<i>b</i>). We will be sensible in the making of that order registering dealers. Originally in this section we provided for 100 days but in the Seanad yesterday, after a great deal of debate and many suggestions, including 60 days, the Minister of State suggested 45 days and that was agreed as a reasonable length of time. We will take care in drafting these orders and in drawing up the permit so as to cause as little disruption as possible to the bona fide trade.</P>
    <P>In relation to the review of the legislation, I accept the principle of a forum. That could be a useful mechanism which could be a type of prelude to the Oireachtas debate. However, I would not like the forum to be used by people who want to go back to the old order but I am sure any regressive elements can be dealt with. This would be a positive forum and, as Deputy Dukes said, we may look back and say we were half mad to introduce such measures. Just as income tax was introduced as a temporary measure several hundred years ago, these things have a habit of becoming permanent or semi-permanent.</P>

      <P>Deputy Connaughton asked about the national beef assurance. There was also a lime subsidy as well. That was a good one. We do not put out half enough lime. We could reduce the use of other fertilisers; if farmers paid to have their soil tested and put proper ingredients into it, it would enhance the environment. The national beef assurance bill is taken into account in this.</P>
      <P>Agents in my own part of the country are an important feature of small farming, especially out in the peninsulas and in other areas. They collect cattle, calves and store cattle but only get a full load by calling on a number of farmers. These factory agents are different to dealers but they will be allowed to continue their business.</P>
      <P>Sheep tagging will come into effect in weeks, two months at most. It was difficult to get the farming organisations and industry to agree to tagging. I stated that in any event it must be introduced by 1 March. This crisis made people more sensible and they agreed to its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authorised officer, mentioned by a number of Deputies, will have extraordinary power under this legislation. The subsections outline their power and who will accompany them in some cases. Authorised officers have to abide by the general provisions of law and act in a reasonable way in good faith. They will be personally liable if they go beyond what is reasonable. They cannot abuse the powers in any way, as the Bill <Col N="817" /> makes clear in section 2(13) where it says they must act in good faith and on reasonable grounds.</P>
    <P>The principle that dealers should be subject to registration, regulation and transparency is wanted by many people. It is not desirable to return to the unregulated operation that pertained up to now. Many people realise what has been happening. I mentioned before sheep travelling from Carlisle, the route and the drop-offs, and the extraordinary difficulty in finding out where they came from and went to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes inquired what class of persons might be appointed. This will include gardaí and the Army. If there is a particular problem at a farm or depot and they want to move in, the authorised officer will call there, accompanied by gardaí or, at the Border, by customs officers. This is the class of person we have in mind.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;other person&rdquo; Deputy Dukes asked about refers, in the case of a difficult or truculent person, to the authorised officer being accompanied by a uniformed garda. The night before last I saw a programme on the BBC or UTV in which a television crew visited a person involved in smuggling north of the Border who assaulted the cameraman. Then the interviewer was visited at the TV station afterwards and warned to get out of the place or end up in hospital, if not the graveyard. Deputy Dukes referred to drugs seizures but this is also a dangerous job requiring a uniformed garda escort and that is what the Bill refers to.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady raised the situation in north Meath regarding the export of calves. This Bill will not interfere with legitimate business. We want to bring a degree of order and registration so as to have a better traceability system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Penrose discussed definitions; they are always difficult. He lost me on the conjunctive and I will not go into that in any detail. The definition of a dealer relates to people buying and selling animals as a business. That is our legal advice. It means as a business, not someone buying a guinea pig for one of the family. A section of the Bill refers to sell and the Deputy asked what exactly sell meant. This is gone into in detail.</P>
    <P>That covers most of the points raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to introduce a sour note into the proceedings but there are two important questions the Minister must answer. What happens here today will be implemented because that is how our democracy works and it will be implemented from tomorrow. The Minister and his officials are here. The interpretation of what we do today is important to what happens on the ground.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that much thought has gone into what legitimate dealers can and cannot do now. It has not been fully thought out. The registration of dealers, as the Minister said, is the important thing and I subscribe to that. I have no problem with it, like everyone else here. If we take it to its logical conclusion that the dealer is registered, in other words, it is 95% of his business &ndash; the Minister can see what I am getting at &ndash; he will then be able to go about his normal business much as he is now. What I am afraid of is that a dealer going to the calf market in Cork on a Monday morning will have to get a licence before he got there for what he was planning to buy. Somehow or another, the man's freedom would be curtailed regarding what he wanted to do. This is a technical point but it is important. He should be allowed to do his business because he is a registered dealer. We all accept that he has to have a list of ear tags of cattle he bought and where he was going with them, but he should not have to ring the DVO in advance to say that he plans to go to Clonakilty in the morning to buy calves. It is a central issue, and I am not yet satisfied the Minister, Deputy Walsh, will introduce what I seek. Livestock marts are the only source of competition in this industry. I assume the agents who go there to buy cattle will not face restrictions apart from those that currently exist. Perhaps the Minister will indicate to me how he proposes to address this. Who will tell a dealer that he can no longer operate? Will it be the local district livestock office? </P>
      <P>Will there be an open and transparent appeals mechanism? The reason a person cannot trade should be made known, so that local prejudices of different kinds will not be a factor. Sometimes people may have developed a dislike of one another over the years. When people are stopped from trading, and I am sure some of them will deserve to be, will the mechanism I have mentioned be in place? </P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I could not attend earlier due to committee engagements. I endorse the remarks of Deputy Johnny Brady in relation to the sale of calves. I am concerned that the permit system may be a little cumbersome. The traditional calf trade is very important in a dairy area like counties Cavan and Monaghan, where the sale of suckler calves can be an important source of income in the early part of the year. I hope the system will be as flexible as possible, and that the outlets for a farmer hoping to sell such calves will not be limited by too much regulation.</P>

      <P>There will be as little disruption as possible to the legitimate business of cattle trading, and none at all if I have my way. I will have an opportunity to ensure that, when I make an order, as is my entitlement under section 3 which says &ldquo;The Minister may by order provide for the approval and registration of dealers and dealers' premises&rdquo;. When I make such an order, it will be straightforward for an officer of the Department or a local district veterinary officer to go to a well known local dealer and register his premises. It will be registered for a minimum of a year, as it would not be feasible to renew registration every second week. To have the premises registered can be said to be 90% of the battle.</P>
      <P>People who lease or rent out land, as well as rogue traders who move cattle carelessly, often annoy good farmers as it can result in the spread of disease. I will make orders under section 3 which will help to stamp out such activity. Ordinary dealers of the kind with which we are all familiar will not have any difficulty in being registered. Their registration will last for a reasonable length of time, 12 months or more, and they will not need to renew their registration when going to a given location.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where a dealer feels that any action taken under <i>subsection (2)(b)</i> is unfair or unnecessarily or unjustifiably interferes with his or her business, that dealer shall have access to the Agricultural Appeals Board to seek redress.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is concerned with the registration and regulation of dealers. The Bill states that &ldquo;the Minister may, by order, provide for the approval and registration of dealers and dealers' <Col N="820" /> premises&rdquo;. The Minister has explained to us that he will do this by order and that when making such an order he will take account of the various issues that have been raised by Deputies Connaughton, Penrose and others. He said that such an order will be reasonable and designed to disrupt the normal flow of trade as little as possible, and to deal with rogue traders.</P>
    <P>Making orders under the 1966 Act is dealt with in section 4. Appropriately enough for a diseases of animals Act, I find one of my pet hobby horses in this section, as the order is in what I call the passive form:</P>
    <P>Every order made by the Minister under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly.</P>
    <P>Without accusing the Minister of any bad faith, that means the Minister's order is laid before the Oireachtas, and unless the Government provides Government time to debate the order within the next 21 sitting days, the Houses do not get a chance to debate it.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows from his experience in this House, on the back and front benches and in the chair, that Deputies can jump up and down, but there is no way they can debate an order of that kind unless the Government makes its time available. As far as I understand Standing Orders, one can even bring a Private Members' motion to ask the Government to bring the order before the House, but it remains subject to the approval of the Government.</P>
    <P>There is another form of order which official advice is always against. This involves the Minister making the order, laying it before the Oireachtas, and it cannot come into effect until it has been voted through by both Houses. Every time I have raised this, Ministers have shown understanding by saying they might do it that way the next time. If Ministers are not being understanding, they say they cannot possibly clutter up the business of the House by having a series of unimportant orders coming in. I do not know how the Minister, Deputy Walsh, feels but if we are to review this legislation in a year's time, I would like to have a look at section 4 of the principal Act, and the way orders are made.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there was anyone around in 1966, when the principal Act came into force, with the same hobby horses as I have. If I had been in the House at that time there might have been the possibility, which does not exist in that Act, of making orders by another procedure. I have not proposed such an amendment as I know I would be wasting my time. The Minister's advisers would say it is all very well to allow Deputy Dukes to have his say, but the House should not be faced with such a technical order, and we should not bother the Minister with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> We are about to take a sensible and justified step to give the Minister powers over the livelihood of a certain number of people that he has not had before, and to give him powers that he can exercise in the public interest, in the interests of the farming community generally, and in the interests of animal health and the prevention of disease. That is important enough to be debated in the House. We will not now have a chance to do it, because once we pass this Bill, making the orders is subject to the procedure in section 4 of the principal Act. Unless the Minister volunteers to do so, we will not debate in this House the regulations that will apply to dealers. The Minister has an opportunity to make an historic first here. He could listen to what I say and appreciating what is in section 4 of the principal Act, guarantee that when he is making these orders he will require the Government Whip to make Government time available to debate them. If he were to do that, he would not hear another mealy-mouthed word from me for the rest of the debate on this entire Bill between now and 5.30 p.m. To be serious, this is important. We are introducing new regulations affecting the livelihood of a certain number of people and the way they deal with a large number of people, namely, farmers. This House should be able to debate that because of the importance of the context in which it is being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure the Minister will be fussed about the amendment. However, if we are making regulations about people's lives, we should in fairness give them the opportunity to make a case if they find the regulations are overly invasive. We have an agricultural appeals board Bill to which the Minister referred earlier, which will be coming back to the House. What I propose would provide a simple way of bringing this in. However, if the Minister would prefer to make a separate provision in that Bill and undertakes to do it in that way, I would accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose:</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the difficulty the Minister might have in referring something to a board that is not yet in existence because the Bill setting it up has not been passed in the Dáil. That is why I am pressing my amendment. Deputy Dukes's amendment seems a bit wider, but both have the same focus in so far as their purpose is to ensure that nobody will be glibly deprived of their livelihood, that nobody can take it upon themselves to refuse a permit to somebody who has been trading or dealing over many years. Everything must be done in a reasonable fashion, and when administrative decisions of that nature are made, reasons must be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason we want an appeals mechanism &ndash; Deputy Dukes made the point in relation to section 4 &ndash; is that most orders are <i>pro forma</i>. <Col N="822" /> They just go through and are not subject to debate. It is a major lacuna in legislation of which all Governments have been guilty. They are eager to get the Act passed, and in implementing it make orders that are taken to be part and corpus of the principal Act. They can do what they want and bring in orders that are seen by officials to be the import of the Act. That is why every word has to be parsed. Every word means something. That is why if there is a decision to refuse to approve or register a dealer or a dealer's premises or to issue a permit, it must be a reasoned decision and subject to an independent appeals process.</P>
    <P>I fought very hard &ndash; I probably bored the Minister to tears because it is something about which I feel very strongly &ndash; for an independent appeals process in the context of the application of the subsidy and premium regime, REPs and so on. I did that for the very good reason that the independence of the system is absolutely critical. An independent system has worked very well in terms of social welfare appeals. There is no use in going up the line from me to the Minister because we are in the same political system, and officials are in the administrative system.</P>
    <P>I will give one example of where justice delayed is justice denied. In January 2000 I was involved in lodging an appeal in relation to a REPs matter for a farmer. I put together a very strong appeal case, and the reply I got here in early March 2001 was that it was still subject to evaluation. The reason, I detected, is that there was a clash between what was in one element of legislation and what was in another. I feel so strongly about it that I intend to advise the farmer to go the legal route. If one goes back to the Paperlink case &ndash; one of the Minister's advisers would know it very well &ndash;  it dealt with the right to a livelihood, the right to earn a living and so on. If the Minister wants to trammel those rights, he must do it in a very circumscribed and clearly delineated way, and set out the reasons very clearly. That is why Deputy Dukes is correct. If orders of that nature are to be brought into being, the Minister must be very careful to lay them before the House so that we will get the opportunity to have an input into them and ensure they are subjected to the closest scrutiny. What is here is fairly fundamental and profound, and that is why we should have that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Regard should be had to any provision in the general law regarding agricultural appeals that might be applicable under the new appeals Bill. Perhaps the Minister will designate that as part of that Bill. That would be fair, and I would accept that. Otherwise it will have to be included as a subsection in this Bill. I believe the Minister will accept these amendments. Deputy Dukes's points have been well made. The laying of orders should not be just an exercise in putting them on the Order Paper and that being the end of the matter. I was taken aback when I realised that laying orders before the House in that way was allowed.</P>

      <P>I support the proposal to set up an appeals system.

I came across an extraordinary case in a different Department where a person told me he had been waiting 22 years to get back at somebody. I would not like this to happen and some form of appeals system should be provided. The majority of departmental officials are extremely honest and only want to do their best. However, there are bad eggs in every basket.</P>
      <P>We are trying to ensure that rogue dealers are pin-pointed and dealt with. However, we must also ensure that a person who ends up in the wrong camp, so to speak, has some right of appeal. As Deputy Dukes said, once an order is introduced we have no means of coming back to it.

      <P>The proposals in these amendments are reasonable. In a democracy the least people are entitled to is a written explanation for a decision. I have no difficulty in accepting the principle of the amendments, but the appropriate place to deal with the setting up of an appeals system is under the agricultural appeals legislation. The legislation has been passed by the Seanad and I have requested the Whip's office to allocate time for the debate in this House. I hope we will be able to debate the legislation within a few weeks. The legislation deals mainly with headage, premia and other schemes operated by the Department. It also deals with the national beef assurance scheme which is about regis<Col N="824" /> tration. A person who has a legitimate grievance about not being registered can make an appeal under the legislation.</P>
      <P>I accepted a number of amendments during the debate in the Seanad. Initially the appeals office was almost identical to the social welfare appeals office. A number of Senators proposed that applications for positions in the office should be open to the entire Civil Service rather than just the Department. I accepted the amendment as it would give all civil servants an opportunity to apply for positions. This should also be the case in regard to many of the bodies set up under the aegis of Departments as it would give talented people an opportunity to work in other areas.</P>
      <P>I understand the point Deputy Dukes was making. The advice I get on a regular basis is that the practice of bringing orders before the House is too cumbersome and time consuming. Orders are required fairly quickly and it would be much better to lay them in the Library. There is some merit in the Deputy's suggestion and I will give it consideration to see how best we can deal with the matter. He also said we should deal with the entire legislation in the review. I give a commitment that the spirit of the amendments in regard to setting up an appeals office will be considered. I will also examine the best way of dealing with the orders.</P>

      <P>Having examined the Supreme Court judgment in Doyle<i> v. </i>An Taoiseach, 1986 ILRM, it seems that section 4(1) is safe in that it confirms the Foot and Mouth Disease Order, 1956, which can be interpreted as having prospective effect only.

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 4 and 5, to delete &ldquo;as on and from the date upon which they purported to come into operation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is getting detailed advice from his officials. They are eminent people in their own right and I respect them. However, I dispute their <Col N="825" /> interpretation of the late John Kelly's book, which I know they resorted to in a vigorous way during the past few hours.</P>
    <P>Article 15.5 of the Constitution is specific in providing that: &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.&rdquo; The Doyle <i>v. </i>An Taoiseach cattle levies case, 1986 ILRM, dealt with section 79 of the Finance Act which purported to confirm the validity of certain levies which had been made by statutory instrument the year before. There is a resonance in this in terms of what the Minister is trying to do. I am not challenging them for an ulterior motive; rather I want to ensure that the legislation will be immune from challenge. Of course, one cannot deprive people of the right to pursue a matter in court.</P>
    <P>In that case the Supreme Court held that if the provisions of the section were intended to have retrospective effect they would, to that extent, be unconstitutional since the result would be <i>ex-post facto</i> to make non-payment of the levy an infringement of the law. Therefore, in order to save that section from unconstitutionality it had to be interpreted as only having prospective effect.</P>
    <P>The wording in section 5 &ldquo;as on and from the date upon which they purported to come into operation&rdquo; will create problems. The section lists all the recent orders made by the Minister to deal with the current crisis. Last Tuesday week I asked what might have sounded like an innocent question. However, sometimes the innocent question is the loaded one, that is, what emergency measures the Minister intended to take to deal with the foot and mouth disease crisis. The wording &ldquo;as on and from the date upon which they purported to come into operation&rdquo; involves an implicit admission that the orders are invalid since the 1966 Act does not adequately extend cover to animals at risk of infection as opposed to animals suspected of being infected.</P>
    <P>The section provides that these orders shall be confirmed as on and from the date upon which they purported to come into operation. In other words, we are being asked to validate these orders and give them retrospective effect. I note the officials disagree with that. We will agree to differ on this matter. Before throwing out the baby with the bath water I draw to the Minister's attention the criminal sanctions for breaches of those orders. If it was a civil sanction it would be a different matter. We are being asked to do precisely what Article 15.5 of the Constitution prohibits where it states:</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.</P>
    <P>In simple layman's terms this law can become complex if one keeps at it. In the Schedule the Minister is amending the Bill under which the orders are purportedly made. That is prospective. In section 5 the orders are being validated from <Col N="826" /> an earlier date than the amendments to the Principal Act come into force. That is retrospective. It does not make sense logically and constitutionally. I would be worried about the retrospective effect of legislation that has a penalty of a criminal nature attached. That is the reason I have asked the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes:</NameTxt>
      <P>As a simple economist I hesitate to get into this argument. I would be much more interested, although it will not happen now, to have the opportunity to debate a later section on sheep tagging and tagging generally than discussing the arcane mysteries of the law with Deputy Penrose. I have a simple mind. Section 4 of the Principal Act informs me that every order made shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made. As far as I know that provision means that the orders come into effect on the day they are made, and remain in effect, unless motions are passed annulling them. The list of orders in section 5 all date from 21 February 2001 or after. None of them has any retrospective effect that I can see. I do not think the Minister will prosecute somebody for not having complied with the provisions of the Foot and Mouth Disease (Hay, Straw and Peat Moss Litter) Order, 2001 (S.I. No. 49 of 2001) because of something they failed to do some time between 1966 and 2001.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister has a response that clinches this argument so that we might be able to have a few minutes to debate the issue of tagging and the amendment the Minister accepted to the section in the Seanad yesterday which vastly improves the provision. If we were ever able to get that far I would like the Minister to discourse to the House on the reasons the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has for the past decade, if not more, found itself unable to be satisfied that any system of electronic tagging could work and has condemned us to the current systems of mechanical and plastic tagging which has given rise to the rows that delayed the tagging of sheep until now.</P>
      <P>If time permitted I would ask the Minister if his plans for sheep tagging include tagging sheep that spend all their lives on the mountain. Is he prepared to accept the proposal from the mountain sheep producers that they would tag everything they sell off the farm if they could avoid having to round up their ewes up the mountains to tag them when in fact some will probably never come off the mountains until taken off as fallen animals? Many sheep spend their days on the mountains and never appear again because they die up there. It is a pity we cannot get that far and that the Minister cannot say he is about to settle in his mind on one of the many systems of electronic tagging that are available and that might put an end, once and for all, to all the arguments we have had here for many years about the difficulties of operating a tagging system with plastic things pushed through holes in animals' ears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Penrose has dwelt on the matter in some detail. The clear and specific legal advice from the Attorney General's office and the Attorney General is that the Deputy's concerns are ill-founded. There is no constitutional difficulty about these orders. The Deputy will realise it was important to bring in those statutory instruments quickly in respect of banning the importation of susceptible animals. The Attorney General told me he has no difficulty with those statutory instruments. I understand the matter was dealt with extensively in the Seanad yesterday. This is a standard provision in the Bill. The advice from the Attorney General's office is that the confirmation of the orders is merely a precautionary measure.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes raised the issue of tagging sheep. Tagging of sheep will be put into effect straight away. It should be complete in about two months. The system of tagging will be a straightforward one. It would be nice if it could be done electronically and have a bolus where there could be a complete tracking system but that system has not yet been perfected. All sheep will be tagged; those up the mountain and half-way up the mountain will be all tagged individually. It will not be a case of just tagging them when they go off the farm. There will be a treaceability system. We have a good one for the cattle population. There is a controlled system in place for cattle but sheep are the big problem. We will allow people to decide over a period if electronic tagging is perfected, because that is the way to go. One will a get a flock number which will be registered in the Central Registration Office. It will bring a great deal of order to the sheep population the same as to the cattle population.</P>

      <P>I am not happy with the Minister's explanation on section 5, particularly his statement that it is normal to confirm orders. It is not normal to confirm them unless there is some defect in them. Why is the phrase that they &ldquo;are confirmed as on and from the date upon which they purported to come into operation&rdquo; used? They either came into operation or they did not. The use of the phrase &ldquo;purported to come into operation&rdquo; suggests just that, that they purported to come in but did not come in. All these orders are recent and were made in the past week or two. Is the Attorney General of the view that they are defective and that something additional is necessary? What about the orders that will be made next week when there will not be a Bill to confirm them. Will they be invalid? The Minister will, no doubt, have to make orders next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a unique occasion in terms of local government legislation. For the first time ever in this State we have the opportunity to consider a Bill to provide the statutory framework for our local government system. The last such legislation for local government, the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, was before the Westminster Parliament at the end of the 19th century. We must, therefore, acknowledge that, since the foundation of the State, the legislative priorities of successive Governments and of all political parties, seem to have largely by-passed local government. The result is that at the start of the 21st century we must delve back to 19th century UK statutes, which still apply, for the basis of local government law. However in the last few years things have changed.</P>
      <P>The Local Government Acts, 1991 and 1994, were indicative of a new direction and the amendment of our Constitution by referendum in 1999, to accord specific recognition to local government and guarantee local elections, marked a key turning point for local government and provides a sound basis on which to build our new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Few people doubt the need for renewal of local government but the means to achieve it and the shape of a renewed and changed local government system can be less clear in people's minds. <Col N="829" /> I must first declare my interest. I am a passionate believer in local government and I speak from experience as a former councillor. I know the system intimately and because of this I am in a position to separate the theory from the reality. I approach these commitments, therefore, as a realist in terms of local government reform.</P>
    <P>Local government is different from other public sector bodies. Often people tend to think of local government primarily as a service provider at local level but it is also much more. It is the democratically elected body closest to the people and it has a constitutionally recognised role of democratic representation for local communities but, for two decades or so, up until recently, local government was not doing well, often through no fault of its own. Its funding base contracted, it was by-passed by new local development initiatives and it began to lose its rightful place at the heart of local communities.</P>
    <P>Within the system the central policy role more often than not fell to the manager and full-time officials with the elected council relegated to the position of reacting to management proposals. Taken together, these developments devalued our democratic system and local government. It became increasingly apparent that action was needed to reverse these trends.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House cannot be looked at in isolation. It is an important element in the Government's ongoing programme to redress the imbalances to which I have referred and to renew our system of local government. The size of the task should not be underestimated but we have made a good start and excellent progress already in a short time. Real and worthwhile change can only be achieved taking account of the needs of all involved. The diverse functions of local government, the number and range of authorities and the input of 1,600 councillors and 30,000 staff must be recognised, their work and commitment valued and important local traditions and heritage safeguarded while adapting the system substantially to meet the demands and needs of Ireland's people in the 21st century.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to achieve these aims. In that context I would like to place on record and acknowledge the work of others. The Local Government Acts, 1991 and 1994, set the tone for a more enlightened approach to local government, removed statutory controls and relaxed the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine. My predecessor, Deputy Howlin, published a wide ranging White Paper, Better Local Government, in 1996. The Bill incorporates and builds on much of that work. The renewal of local government was a commitment of this Government in An Action Programme for the Millennium and is now endorsed by the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I am very proud of our achievements over the last three and a half years.</P>
    <P>What have been my priorities in the programme for the renewal of local government? On becoming Minister, my first priority was to put in place a proper funding system. Over the past 20 <Col N="830" /> to 25 years there was a constant argument about whether we should tackle the functions or the finances of local government. Most of my predecessors concentrated on trying to change and adapt the functions.</P>
    <P>However, it was essential to secure the necessary resources for the ambitious programme of local government renewal that we planned. For that reason the new local government fund was established by legislation in 1998 and it is delivering significant additional resources as borne out by this year's allocations. In 2001, £730 million is being provided to local authorities. In terms of the general purpose needs of local authorities, the fund is delivering almost 64% more than in 1997. In addition, the improvement in current funding is complemented by the major increase in capital funding for local authority projects under the terms of the national development plan to provide the essential services and infrastructure for a modern society.</P>
    <P>My next priority was to develop a broad range of ongoing initiatives in a drive for better efficiencies, to modernise local authority operations and to support local authority members. Actions which have made significant advances already or on which work is currently well in hand include an equalisation model to facilitate the allocation of resources from the local government fund in a way which takes account of local authority needs and resources. Deputy Gilmore referred to this during the earlier debate on the financial resolution on motor taxation. He reminded me of an offer I made to the local government committee to make a presentation on the needs and resources model. I have no difficulty with that but I am not sure whether any invitation was extended. We can renew the offer to the committee because it is important that everybody is aware of what is the basis of the needs and resources model and of the ongoing changes that will need to be put in place.</P>
    <P>The democratic input mentioned earlier is also important. We have also put in place modern, financial management, accounting and audit systems, proper service indicators and new corporate plans, a pilot programme of one-stop-shops, support for necessary IT systems to underpin these initiatives and a major programme of information and training for councillors. This began with a series of seminars for new councillors. The second phase saw an intensive focus on the chairs of SPCs to support them in key policy areas such as roads, housing and planning. The next phase, which is currently in planning and which will be discussed shortly with the representative organisations, will extend to all councillors.</P>
    <P>Strategic policy committees are beginning to operate as intended. They will allow elected members to develop a central role in policy development in partnership with relevant sectoral interests and with proper back up. I very much regret that progress here was long delayed owing to industrial relations issues. However, I now anticipate that the modern management systems <Col N="831" /> necessary to support the process, with the directors of service, is finally about to be put in place. It is already in place in many local authorities.</P>
    <P>Another significant step in repositioning local government was the establishment last year of county and city development boards. These bring together, under the local government umbrella, the wide range of State agencies operating locally, together with the social partners and local development bodies. These dynamic new bodies are providing a unique opportunity to maximise the combined impact of State agencies at local level. Working in partnership with the various local interests they are devising a strategy for economic, social and cultural development attuned to the needs of the county or city concerned and will oversee its delivery. This represents a new way for the public service to come together and operate on a collective basis for the common good and, crucially, under the democratic leadership of local government. The CDBs are now up and running and have directors and support staff in place.</P>
    <P>These initiatives which I have listed are already putting into practice the theory and objectives behind much of the Bill, from county development boards to new financial management systems, from better training for councillors to service indicators, to SPCs, to modern management systems, improved funding and better partnership arrangements. All are interlinked. Each has its own role in the drive to renew our local government system. The Bill confirms the importance of all these initiatives and provides the statutory framework by which they will be carried forward.</P>
    <P>All in all, what is involved here is a renewal programme designed to build on progress to date, tailored to Irish circumstances, and which can significantly improve the position of local government. Of course, local government systems vary widely across different countries. Local government in any country derives from the particular tradition, history, culture and circumstances of that country and prospects for change must bear this in mind. The delivery of functions such as policing, public transport, health and social welfare, comes within the local government system in some other countries. However, if we are realistic, given current Irish circumstances, it is unlikely that in the short term these will be subsumed within our local government system or that there is a demand for such, much as we might wish it so.</P>
    <P>In short, if local government is to progress in this country, it demands that we approach change in a realistic way, taking account of how functional responsibilities have evolved and how they are currently organised. We must, therefore, start from where we find ourselves today and move forward in a planned and progressive fashion to renew our system of local government.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt there will be criticisms that the Bill does not go far enough. However, reaction to date to some of the more innovative proposals, <Col N="832" /> for example, the directly elected chair, is a reliable indicator that radical change is unlikely to find widespread acceptance in local government circles. Would a system like the Scottish one, with similar legislative origins to our own but now with 32 local authorities, find acceptance? What about a complete redrawing of the current local government map? I have said before in public and repeat in the House that if I had a blank sheet of paper to devise a local government system I would not devise the one we have currently.</P>
    <P>However, as I said earlier, I approach the task of renewing local government in this country as a realist. I recognise that we need to walk before we can run and so the Bill attempts to strike a balance between the change required to enable the local government system to meet the demands of a modern inclusive society of the 21st century while retaining the solid foundations which have served us well for over a century. I see this Bill as a blueprint for change and modernisation and a platform or springboard for further change in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not, therefore, abandon local government as we know it, but rather builds on past work and current structures. The county/city system is maintained, as are the town local authorities, in all a grand total of 114 elected local authorities. In future, these authorities must operate on a new basis with a new ethos, building on the concepts of partnership and inclusion. We must place greater emphasis on working together, be it town and county or adjoining counties and cities, and the Bill provides for this. While the policy and executive roles are continued, they are subject to significant change and rebalancing designed to enhance the role of the elected council. Many provisions in the Bill present members with a renewed opportunity to reclaim their rightful role as the policy makers. What the Bill aims to promote is a strong but workable framework in which the executive operates within policy parameters determined by the elected council, in which local government operations are overseen by that council and with the provision of necessary supports.</P>
    <P>The Bill emphasises the links with local communities from which local government derives its mandate. It supports community involvement in a more participative local democracy and will provide for improved financial and organisational systems and procedures and for more efficient service provision.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the Bill strives to reinforce the rightful position of the elected council in determining local authority policy. It places the executive under a duty to implement democratically settled policy and for executive functions to be carried out in accordance with it. However, no matter what legislation is put in place, any system is only as good as the people in it and the commitment borne out by the service of councillors throughout the local government system. We acknowledge this in a real way by providing for practical supports to assist members <Col N="833" /> by way of a salary type payment, allowances and training, and with provision for pension arrangements.</P>
    <P>There are already many demands on councillors' time. Along with the practical supports just mentioned, the ending of the dual mandate will facilitate a dedicated corps of councillors to focus on local authority affairs, free to organise business and without the constraints of parliamentary schedules.</P>
    <P>It is my intention also to promote another powerful impetus for change in the internal dynamics of local government through the direct election of a full-time cathaoirleach of cities and counties with a term of office for the five year life of the council. I am talking about a cathaoirleach who is directly answerable to the people and accountable to the elected council, who must work with the council to deliver on the full potential of the office, which is highly visible and accountable, a person elected by the people who draws on powerful democratic legitimacy to speak and negotiate on behalf of the whole community with influence well beyond any formal powers and with the capacity to bring together the various elements of local governance. Experience elsewhere bears this out if the opportunities being presented are grasped and acted upon in a spirit of collaboration for the common good. When the SPCs involve councillors from the outset in policy development and the key role of the corporate policy group are also considered I believe the Bill provides the opportunity for genuine change and will place the elected council central to local authority operations where it belongs.</P>
    <P>None of this can happen of course without the continued commitment of local authority staff. While some of the faces are well known, most are never in the headlines but they all continue to provide a quality service every day of their working careers, even in difficult and dangerous situations. We owe a debt of gratitude to those who play their part to provide clean water, run emergency services, build our infrastructure, maintain our parks and streets, protect our environment and provide a range of services every day and night, 365 days a year. Despite some occasional problems and difficulties, such as those which have come to light recently, it is clear that the ideal of a high standard of public service is still alive and well in this country and in the local government service. I am confident it will continue.</P>
    <P>One of the aims of this Bill is also to consolidate and update our local government law to provide a modern statutory foundation for local government and to place between two covers general local government law in a format which is accessible to councillors, staff and public, as against the current situation of a variety of overlapping provisions scattered over a wide range of enactments with archaic terminology that is complex and well nigh impenetrable. The Bill provides a modern statutory framework for local <Col N="834" /> authority operations and a range of general powers available to all local authorities and also provides for the repeal of legislation dating back a century and a half. Separate Bills to follow, one to update rating law and the other dealing with water services, will complete the process of modernising the service codes and repeal the remaining pre-Independence statutes.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to deal with all aspects of this wide ranging Bill. However, its various provisions will receive full attention during its passage through this House and I will confine myself to some of its provisions.</P>
    <P>Part 1 contains standard provisions of a general nature such as title, definitions and commencement. To allow for adequate advance notice certain provisions will not, however, come into effect until the next local elections in 2004. These are the direct election of the cathaoirleach for cities and counties and the ending of the dual mandate. Other provisions will be commenced on a phased basis, starting soon after enactment as the necessary preparatory work is completed.</P>
    <P>Part 2 contains key provisions in that it establishes our local authorities within a modern legislative format and follows directly from Article 28A of Bunreacht na hÉireann which provides: &ldquo;There shall be such directly elected local authorities as may be determined by law . . .&rdquo;. That law is this Local Government Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 10 divides the State into local government areas, counties and cities. Within the counties, and forming part of them, are the town local authorities. Each of these areas, county, city or town, has a local authority known, as appropriate, as a county council, city council or town council. I know the borough authorities have expressed particular concerns as to the modernisation of terminology in this way and how their own local authorities are to be styled in future. I have met with the five mayors through the AMAI and propose to introduce amendments on Committee Stage which, while retaining the overall integrity of the Bill, will deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>Parts 3 and 4 deal with local authority membership and local elections. From 2004 the dual mandate will end. However, I will bring forward amendments to provide for continued access to local government information for Oireachtas Members. The termination of the dual mandate was recommended by the Barrington report, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Commission for the Status of Women and, I noticed recently, Fine Gael among others. Also, the Bill provides that in future co-optees to a local authority must be nominated by the party for which that member was elected. I will look again at this provision from the point of preventing possible abuse and to better reflect the position of councillors generally. As previously indicated, local elections are fixed at five yearly intervals to be held in the month of May or June, with the next local elections in 2004 now guaranteed by the Constitution, thus ending a long history of post<Col N="835" /> ponements which served to diminish local government.</P>
    <P>Finally, a mechanism is included in section 22 for an alteration in the number of members of a local authority. This involves a report by the independent Local Government Commission provided for in Part 11. This commission also has a role regarding the review of local electoral areas, the alteration of local authority boundaries under Part 8 and the establishment of new town councils.</P>
    <P>A number of changes apply under Part 5 as regards the cathaoirleach which, as under existing law, is the generic title. Existing mayors and lord mayors continue and it will be open to any local authority to adopt the title mayor or cathaoirleach. As stated previously, from 2004 the cathaoirleach of counties and cities will be elected by direct vote of the people and will hold office for the life of the council. While in office and for 12 months afterwards he or she is disqualified from standing for Dáil elections. The Bill as published allows anyone qualified to stand as a councillor to put themselves forward for election as a directly elected chair. However, I know the local authority associations consider that some level of experience should be required for the post and I have undertaken to deal with this aspect by way of amendment, if this is legally and constitutionally possible.</P>
    <P>Regarding meetings of local authorities, Part 6 establishes a statutory right of public access and restricts the right to meet in committee to special cases and subject to special procedures. Schedule 9 sets out a comprehensive, updated and consolidated code for local authority meetings. The framework for local authority committees and joint committees is set out in Part 7.</P>
    <P>Part 9 contains a general statement of local authority functions while individual services such as fire, waste, planning, etc, are carried out under specific legislation which for convenience are listed in Schedule 11. The Bill provides a range of general powers available to all local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill also emphasises the need for town and county authorities to work together, to combine their operations to the fullest extent as well as the need for all authorities to focus on serving the public to whom rigid organisational distinctions are often seen as unhelpful.</P>
    <P>Part 10 allows for necessary inter-authority co-operation in the performance of functions and provides the flexibility for service arrangements to be made on foot of local agreements between town and county authorities. Part 12 will allow for the modernisation of financial management, accounts and audit to provide transparent, user friendly and comparable data for all authorities. For reasons of greater effectiveness, the water services function is consolidated at county level in Part 9, as was proposed in Better Local Government. In saying this, however, the Bill allows for joint arrangements to be worked out locally where this may be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> Part 14 sets out the respective roles of the elected council, manager and staff. An array of mechanisms is provided to enable the elected council to maintain a proper overview, to develop, make and steer policy and to oversee the executive, with proper supports and back up as referred to earlier. Local authority personnel and management law is also consolidated and updated.</P>
    <P>Part 15 provides a comprehensive new ethics framework for members and officials. It is regrettable that the actions of a few can bring the system into disrepute. While the vast majority of members and officials have worked long, hard, honestly and in the public interest, we realise that recent revelations, affecting a small minority, have damaged public trust. That trust must be restored.</P>
    <P>This Part provides an open and transparent framework which will apply to all aspects of local authority operations and will involve disclosure of interest in any matter which arises, an annual statement of interests, a public register, active implementation and a role for the independent Public Offices Commission. These measures will be complemented by codes of conduct which will supplement and expand on the Bill's provisions. Amendments will be brought forward as the Bill proceeds to further strengthen this Part and to take account of changes related to the prevention of corruption legislation, the Standards in Public Office Bill and other ongoing developments.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the three local authority associations &ndash; AMAI, GCCC and LAMA &ndash; with whom I have had intensive consultations before and since publication of the Bill. I met with them collectively and individually on several occasions. They put forward a number of amendments, some of which I indicated I would introduce to meet their concerns. We will not agree on every point but this Bill has already benefited as a result of this dialogue. Many others have commented on the Bill, including Opposition Deputies. All comments will be considered carefully. It is good there is such interest in this Bill and, in keeping with the approach I adopted on the Planning and Development Act, I will be open to amendments from the Opposition as it proceeds through the House.</P>
    <P>The local government renewal programme should be seen as work in progress. A task of this importance and magnitude cannot be accomplished overnight, nor summarised in a single soundbite. This Bill is a vital element in an undertaking of fundamental importance to the Irish people. It is designed to improve local government both in its operations and its relevance to the communities it serves and to modernise its procedures. It sweeps away statutory cobwebs dating back two centuries to provide a modern legal foundation for our local government system, one which is founded on principles of democracy, partnership and community. It provides the framework to carry forward the renewal programme already well under way. It <Col N="837" /> will significantly enhance the role of the elected councils and will give local government the freedom to develop in the new directions essential to the development of our democratic system.</P>
    <P>It is a landmark Bill for local government and I confidently commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>For as long as I can remember, certainly for as long as I have been involved in politics, there has been talk about the reform of local government. At every election, local and national politicians have the aspiration to reform local government. People who are interested in and care about this subject have eagerly anticipated this Bill. However, it has been a gross disappointment.</P>
      <P>When one considers the potential of local government to meaningfully improve the quality of life of every citizen within their environment, the need to strengthen the local sphere of influence, to balance the ever increasing trends toward centralisation both nationally and at EU level, the effect of globalisation and the increasing sense of alienation it inculcates, the sense people increasingly have that they have less and less influence over any decisions, however small, that impact on them and on their families, this Bill offered a unique opportunity to redress the balance. Unfortunately, it has been a lost opportunity and a bitter disappointment to local representatives and local authority officials.</P>
      <P>It would be a bitter disappointment too to members of the public if they still retained any interest in or expectations of efficient and effective local government. They no longer have that. Local government has been so neglected, under-funded, abused, centrally controlled and made so irrelevant that people have not just lost interest in it, they have a cynicism about it that borders on contempt. I am not exaggerating. That is certainly my experience in Dublin. One need only look at the turnout at local elections to see the irrelevancy local government has become for the public. We wonder at the lack of interest in national elections and worry about the turnout but that turnout is almost halved in local elections. Effectively, it means people are withdrawing their consent to local government.</P>
      <P>It is a heartbreaking and demoralising development for the 30,000 local government officials and the more than 800 councillors who believe in the potential of local democracy. They see what they could do but cannot, what is needed and what they cannot deliver. They want to be able to respond to local needs but see themselves regarded by the public not as their representatives and the people who are on the same side and share a common objective but as being in confrontation with the people they seek to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local government in Ireland has a proud history. It has served the country well and administered democracy through difficult years. It has a sound administrative structure rooted in the county system which has helped to grow and reflect a local sense of place and county loyalty. <Col N="838" /> It has done more for public health through the provision of water and public sewerage systems than all the money poured into the medical services.</P>
    <P>I do not wish, in any way, to diminish or to belittle the ongoing efforts of councillors and officials who are trying, against all the odds, to respond to the needs of citizens. However, the system is creaking at the seams. It is simply no longer appropriate in its administration, structure, functions, representation or its method of funding. The system that served us well in slower and gentler times is hopelessly inadequate to cope with the demands of the 21st century. Members of the public are working longer and harder than ever before. They are making huge and stressful demands on themselves to be efficient in the exercise of their jobs and they expect and demand that all agencies of the State be equally efficient. They expect their local authorities to deliver &ndash; efficiently, effectively and on time &ndash; the infrastructure, facilities and services required by increased urbanisation, a growing economy and by a population that is expanding, mobile, stressed and merciless in its judgment of politicians.</P>
    <P>Local government is not geared to respond to these changing demands. By its nature, as a creature of central Government, it is doomed to fail to meet these expectations. It is a miracle that it has coped as well as it has and enormous credit is due to councillors, managers and officials throughout the country whose sense of public service has motivated them to continue struggling to deliver more and better services to their communities against a background of increasing public cynicism.</P>
    <P>The challenge to transform local government, to empower community leadership and to give a vibrant responsive system of democratic representation to a society which in recent decades has undergone radical social and economic transformation is enormous. I accept the Minister's declaration that he is passionate about improving local government and that he genuinely wants to improve it. However, the accretion of layers of bureaucracy, functions, relationships, legislation and regulation by successive Administrations needs to be untangled. There are vested interests, systems inertias and resistance to change to be overcome and none of it will be easy. The only thing on which there is agreement is that a new beginning for local government is required. However, this Bill does not come close to providing it.</P>
    <P>The Bill comprises 241 sections, all of which do little more than move the deckchairs on the sinking ship of local government. There are three or four proposals of interest. If they have not exactly exercised the public, they have caused intense debate among councillors.  I welcome other minor changes. The vast majority of the provisions, however, are merely restatements of existing provisions, albeit in more moderate language, or give a legal basis to existing practices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> Much work has gone into preparing the Bill over three years, but all that work has brought forth the most timid of creatures. The Bill does not have the teeth to undertake the thorough modernisation and reform which would equip local authorities to meet the needs of citizens in the 21st century.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how any section of the Bill does anything fundamental to achieve the Minister's stated aims of enhancing the role of elected members, supporting community involvement, underpinning the programme of local government renewal or modernising legislation. By definition, the Bill does modernise legislation, but not in the radical way required to promote efficiency and effectiveness. If the Bill disappeared off the face of the earth, no one would miss it apart from the provision regarding the payment of councillors.</P>
    <P>The Bill is lacklustre and devoid of a single innovative idea. There is nothing radical, no fundamental reform, nothing to even merit comment. One gets the impression that the Minister cast around for a headline making measure which would ignite even a modicum of public interest in the Bill &ndash; something to put in the press statement. That is how I regard the suggestion for directly elected mayors.</P>
    <P>I have nothing against directly elected mayors, and on the face of it there is nothing wrong with this proposal. I understand the reason this idea has intuitive appeal to the public as it conjures up images of the great European cities where powerful personalities drive and forge change and where they have the budgets, the majorities and the administrations to make a fundamental difference to their citizens' quality of life.</P>
    <P>This idea is, however, a nonsense in the context of the Irish electoral system. Worse still, it is a dangerous nonsense. Europe operates a list system of elections in order that when a mayor is elected he or she automatically brings a majority. That ability to command a majority gives mayors their standing in the community and their mandate and ability to effect change.</P>
    <P>Given our electoral system, any directly elected mayor would be a meaningless animal without a function, a majority, a budget or an administration. At best, he or she would be a figurehead, a distraction and a deception, designed to fool the public into believing that voting for such a person would have some meaningful impact on peoples' lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a declaration of Fine Gael's support for electoral reform &ndash; single seat constituencies and list systems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should wait for it. At worst, this is a dangerous experiment establishing a leadership figure who has no one to lead, creating constant strife and tension between a council and its mayor and grossly inhibiting the decision making process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> The Minister has complained about the decision making process in local government. Surely, that process is slow enough without creating conditions which almost prevent any decisions being made. If this is such a good idea why are we only suggesting it for local elections and not for national elections? What if Fianna Fáil came into the House at the last election with an overall majority, but Deputy Noonan was the directly elected Taoiseach? Has the Minister given any thought as to how that might work and the effect it might have on the governance of the country?</P>
    <P>If the Minister finds that prospect too appalling, would he consider Deputy Joe Higgins, for example? I do not wish to cast aspersions on Deputy Higgins as I am sure he would be a great Taoiseach. I cannot see Fianna Fáil, however, supporting a single policy proposal of his.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil would support anything if it meant power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be a fly, however, on the wall at Cabinet meetings. Such a Taoiseach would be only a figurehead in constant conflict with the Dáil with potentially catastrophic consequences for the efficient transaction of Dáil business. That is the scenario the Minister is proposing to visit on every council.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken one hit on this proposal and agreed to introduce an amendment to require an aspiring mayor to serve five years in advance of putting himself or herself forward. This would overcome the problem of getting a personality such as a pop star or sports star. It does not address, however, the fundamental problem of the lack of a majority and the potential conflict it would have on decision making.</P>
      <P>The scenario in councils is even more fraught than in the Dáil. Unlike the European situation where new mayors bring in an elected council majority, in most cases they also bring in their own administrations. Councillors in Ireland share power with an appointed manager and there is no provision in the Bill to transfer powers from managers to new mayors or elected councillors.</P>
      <P>The directly elected mayoral system introduces an unwelcome new layer between managers and elected members. That relationship is, at best, a fairly delicate balance and depends on the relationship for its effectiveness. That relationship depends on the personalities involved and varies from county to county.</P>
      <P>This new proposal will fundamentally change the relationship between councils, mayors and managers. This measure has the almost unavoidable potential to grossly disrupt and destabilise the functioning and decision making process in every council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is creating a monster whose havoc wreaking potential we can only begin to guess at. This will be the Minister's legacy to local government for which he will be harshly judged. The public may find the notion of directly elected <Col N="841" /> mayors appealing and believe it is giving it a say in local government. It will not easily forgive, however, when it discovers it is a measure of image, not substance, when it sees the damage it does and when it realises how it has been deceived. The Minister knows this. He knows how functionless and meaningless this position would be. He described the main functions of the mayor as someone who could nominate people for civic honours and entertain visiting guests, including guests from overseas. These are important functions, but they are not what local government or the public are crying out for.</P>
    <P>The Minister favours the introduction of the list system of elections. If that is what he wants, he should bring forward those proposals to the House and the public. In that context, directly elected mayors would make a great deal of sense. Before Committee Stage I advise the Minister to drop this daft proposal before it irreparably damages local government. We do not have the majority to stop this proposal, although we might be joined by the Independents, but the Minister should consider introducing it on a pilot basis.</P>
    <P>The dual mandate is the other issue exercising some of the Minister's backbenchers and his Independent supporters. Fine Gael supports the principle of abolishing the dual mandate. If local government is to be truly local and if the status of elected councillors is to be enhanced in order that they become real leaders of local opinion with the courage to make the decisions which that status entails, then we must break the link with central government.</P>
    <P>Ending the dual mandate will not on its own end the double jobbing. Dáil Deputies will still be lobbied on local issues and that will continue for as long as the Department keeps control of the funding, policy and detail of local authorities' work. Consequently, the Department and the Minister are the final arbiter of local decisions. This will continue for as long as other functions now outside local government, but which could and should be provided for locally, remain centrally controlled. If the Minister wishes to enhance the role of locally elected members, to end the dual mandate and separate local from national government, these issues should be attended to.</P>
    <P>The Independents are right when they say their Dáil seats are being jeopardised. Worse still, we are disenfranchising the public. For as long as local issues are dictated centrally the public will continue to appeal to Deputies as it cannot get local satisfaction. The inability of Deputies to respond means that seats will be lost. We cannot fool ourselves about this. Unless we make the break and distinguish between areas of local and national competence we cannot make an electoral distinction.</P>
    <P>Independents also voiced a valid concern that the Minister is building a one-way gate between local and central government which prohibits any cross-over from national to local politics, but facilitates passage from local to national politics. <Col N="842" /> This is a problem the solution to which may be found in other countries. We should examine how they deal with it. In Denmark, for instance, where there is strong local government, a five-year waiting period applies to candidates seeking election to the national parliament. This option is worth examining because it has the virtue of forcing candidates to make the initial decision and encourages only those with a genuine interest in and commitment to local government to make that choice. It will not solve the fundamental problem that so few people will commit themselves only to serve in local government when its control is still so deeply centralised.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for the remuneration of councillors. I share the sense of outrage felt by so many councillors around the country who have waited so long for this measure. The Minister paid gratuities to departing councillors, amazingly at the expense of the those councillors who were willing to participate in the democratic process by putting themselves forward for election. They were hard working councillors, committed to public service, who were most likely to achieve re-election. The concept of paying people not to involve themselves in local government is one which I still find difficult to understand. A firm commitment was given to pay councillors and give them some recompense by way of a salary for their time and effort. They should not have had to wait two years for that commitment to be met. When the Minister finally introduces the measure, I hope he will backdate it to June.</P>
    <P>This is the one section for which there is any urgency or public demand. The Minister should remove it from this Bill, which is going nowhere, and introduce it as a separate provision which would have the support of everybody in the House.</P>
    <P>The issue of payment for local representatives raises a more fundamental question which has not been addressed; that concerns where the next generation of councillors will come from, and if there will be any. Who will they be and whom will they represent? Gone are the days of voluntary service by gentlemen or ladies of means, the self-employed who formed quite a large proportion of those in local government. Such people face increasing costs if they neglect their businesses to attend to council matters, and that is a real deterrent. We can no longer draw from the ranks of the unemployed, which we did for some time, because they do not exist any more. Thus, representation is not balanced and the calibre of representation is becoming a real problem. Women are under represented as are PAYE workers who cannot devote the necessary time to local authority work. Business people, with the exception of farmers, are less and less attracted to such work . One used to talk about farmers, publicans and auctioneers as forming the basis of local government but such people are now less attracted to it.</P>
    <P>Thousands of people who work in high-tech companies like Intel and Hewlett Packard are not represented in local government at all and that is <Col N="843" /> a genuine problem. Part of the explanation why people are not tempted into public service concerns the low esteem in which all politicians are held, but there is more to it than that. If the job of councillor is to be well done then it is really no longer a part-time job comprising a few hours of public service per month. Not only is it now more demanding and time consuming, it also requires an increasingly complex, technical and scientific knowledge and an exacting appreciation of a wide range of issues. Councillors are now being asked to make decisions on complex and sophisticated matters which will have huge and far-reaching implications for the public. As the Minister knows, local issues are often hugely emotive and the public can have access to greater levels of knowledge and expertise than councillors, the very people who are supposed to persuade and lead public opinion. If the Minister wonders about the lack of progress on his waste management strategy, he need look no further than this explanation. I doubt that the small salary being envisaged will make any difference to that trend.</P>
    <P>Over the years there have been calls from every source for devolution and greater funding for local authorities. I am inclined to agree with the Minister in that I am loath to seek greater devolution until such time as councillors are adequately funded to perform the statutory functions they already have. Almost on a monthly basis, additional new responsibilities are being thrown at local government by way of legislation or regulation without any commensurate increase in funding or in the technical resources required to implement them. If local authorities fail it is not because of any lack of commitment by elected members or by council personnel, it is simply because they have not been allowed to succeed.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest barriers to success is the big brother attitude adopted to local authorities by the Minister's Department. This attitude is based on a total lack of trust of local authorities and a complete failure to accept that they are independent and accountable units of local government. There is a yawning gap between the way in which policy is dictated from the top and the real problems of implementation on the ground.</P>
    <P>Funding for projects increasingly comes in parcels for specific use, thus removing all local discretion, flexibility and potential for efficiency. Who among the public could believe a system operates whereby a council receives specific funding for resurfacing a road, but in no circumstances is it allowed to touch the footpath beside it? How can local representatives who are forced to participate in this kind of nonsense be anything other than figures of ridicule. It does not end there. Every single scheme, from a single house to a major water supply, must have its design checked and re-checked at every phase and its funding audited and re-audited, as if there was no professional expertise or integrity at local level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> The result of this overly intrusive big brother attitude is that we have a major infrastructural deficit, no spatial planning, a housing crisis and a looming waste management catastrophe. When councils fail to deliver, and fail they must in these circumstances, there are inevitable calls to set up new bodies to replace them. These quangos include the EPA, the DTO and the NRA. Amazingly, these bodies attract adequate funding. It is an irony that completely unaccountable bodies such as these have the trust of the Minister's Department in a way that the democratic and only truly accountable bodies of local government do not.</P>
    <P>The biggest travesty of all is that the power of local government is being eroded at local level. When it was decided to encourage and fund local development &ndash; and I support this &ndash; instead of channelling funding through the bodies best placed to know about local needs, more quangos were established. I accept that many of these programmes, including the Leader programmes, did excellent work, but they were totally unaccountable. The decision was, rightly made to rein in some control to local government over the millions of pounds that were being distributed in that way. Instead of rationalising the bodies, however, we have added to the layers of such bodies meeting at local level, with county development boards and so on. There is such a multiplicity of bodies administering local affairs that the whole system is groaning under the weight of meetings required just to keep the various actors involved in touch with one another. It is absorbing thousands of hours of local officials, councillors and the public we have dragged in to participate in this farce. It is wholly inefficient and unproductive. All the participants are now so busy attending meetings that they have no time between meetings to do anything. We have created a monster. It is not participative democracy, but anarchy. I believe in local partnership but there is no public demand for the system the Minister has given to us. If the public had any appreciation of what is being done in their name there would be a national outcry.</P>
    <P>The public want effective representation and efficient implementation. It is that simple. It should have been the focus of the Bill but, unfortunately, it is not. We will oppose the Bill on Second Stage on the grounds outlined in the amendment I have submitted. The Minister should withdraw the Bill and go back to the drawing board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of and debate on this Bill has been delayed for a long time. Its contents are disappointing and its future is in serious doubt. This Bill should have been published and enacted two years ago, before the local elections in 1999. Those elections were deferred in 1996 to allow the Government to bring forward proposals and legislation for the reform of local councils. The Minister, despite being in office between 1997 and 1999, failed to produce the Bill in time <Col N="845" /> for the local elections in 1999. The Bill was eventually published last May and it has taken the Minister ten months to bring it before the House.</P>
      <P>The contents of the Bill are extremely disappointing. It contains no fundamental reform of our 19th century system of local government. There are no changes in local government structures or local authority boundaries, no devolution of new powers, functions or resources to local authorities and there is no change in the undemocratic imbalance between the power of county managers and the role of elected members. The Bill is mainly a repetition of existing local government law &ndash; in so far as it consolidates that law, it is welcome &ndash; and a restatement of existing structures such as strategic policy committees and corporate policy groups.</P>
      <P>I understand that the only two significant proposals in the Bill, for directly elected mayors and council chairpersons and for the provision of the end to the dual mandate, are currently being negotiated by the Minister. I further understand that the Minister intends to restrict eligibility for election as mayor or chairperson to politicians with five years service as public representatives. The Labour Party considers that such an approach would be undemocratic and would be an attempt to deny to members of the public the freedom and right to elect a city mayor or council chairperson of their choice. We will not subscribe to the creation of a political closed shop in local government.</P>
      <P>It is an open secret that the four Fianna Fáil Independents will not agree to the abolition of the dual mandate. I was disappointed that the Minister did not inform the House about the current position regarding his discussions and negotiations with those Deputies. It is clear that his ability to progress the Bill through the House will rest on his ability or otherwise to carry with him Members on the that side of the House.</P>
      <P>There are few subjects which have been discussed as often or as exhaustively as local government reform. Since the publication of the Barrington report in 1971, there have been three decades of discussion and debate about local government. We had the IPA report, the White Paper in the early 1970s, new proposals in 1985, a new Barrington report in 1990, more recently the Lacey report, a succession of Local Government Bills in 1991 and 1994, the constitutional amendment referendum to which the Minister referred and the postponement of local elections in 1984, 1990, 1996 and 1998 to allow for the introduction of local government reform. With what have we been presented following those three decades of discussion, debate, consultation, White Papers, documents and postponement of elections? The answer is this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill is ever passed, with what will we be left? We will end up with the same structures of local government that existed 100 years ago. These will be based on the county model, with municipal authorities acting, in the main, as sub<Col N="846" /> sidiaries of the county authority. We will be presented with a system where, effectively, city and county managers, not the members and councillors elected by the public, will exercise the real power and executive functions in local authorities. We will be left with a system of local government where there will be no change in the functions which are carried out at local level by local authorities and those carried out at national level by local government.</P>
    <P>The Bill will make no fundamental change to our current local government systems, structures and practices. During the past three decades, when the discussion and debate to which I refer was taking place, the position of local government has been seriously diminished. Rates, domestic and agricultural, were abolished which removed the independent funding base of local authorities. A range of new national bodies, such as the National Roads Authority, the EPA and others, were established, all of which removed functions from local authorities. The functions of local authorities in relation to the health services were removed with the establishment of the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the greater Dublin area. Even the local health committees were abolished. The functions of local authorities in relation to agriculture, through the old county committees of agriculture, were also removed.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell that tribute must be paid to the service given by elected members and officials of local authorities in the past. Despite their best efforts, however, there is a declining public respect for the local government system and for local authorities. That is reflected in the declining turnout at elections, in the declining number of people willing to stand as candidates for election to local authorities, in a reduction in the number of functions carried out by local authorities and in a decline in the quality of service provided by those authorities. There is a serious level of demoralisation in the local government system at present. This, and the attendant decline in motivation, has been contributed to by the Minister's decision to abolish the senior professional positions, such as county planner, county architect and county engineer, in local authorities, which has removed the career path of professionals working in the local government system.</P>

He did not reform the system as originally intended and professional staff in local authorities are now seriously demotivated because they can no longer aspire to the top positions within their professions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people who want to work as engineers, architects and planners and not necessarily as managers. It was a great mistake to abolish the top positions to which they might have aspired, both from the careers point of view and from the point of view of the service provided to the public. It is a mistake that larger authorities will not have county planners and, in the course of time, that there will be no county or city architects or engineers.</P>
      <P>The problem with discussing local government reform is that, up to now, the debate has concentrated too much on structures. We would be better to commence any discussion of local government by addressing the question of functions. If we are serious about the principle of subsidiarity &ndash; to which we all pay lip service &ndash; the development of local government and our commitment to the concept and principles of local government, it follows that there should be a fundamental devolution of functions from central Government to local government. There should be a fundamental reappraisal of the functions performed by central Government and by local government.</P>
      <P>To some extent we almost need to reverse many of the functions because we have ended up with local authorities being essentially responsible for the provision and management of the physical infrastructure. Many of the public services which in other countries are delivered through the local government system, such as social services, education, health, policing and so on, are being delivered by central government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To some extent there is a case for switching much of that around. Let us take, for example, the delivery of water service in Dublin. There is a case for saying that there should be a Dublin water authority and if one takes into account Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and so on, the greater conurbation of Dublin now has six or seven local authorities delivering water to it. We have a situation where local government is responsible for the delivery of a major area of infrastructure yet if a school wants to build on an additional classroom, it has to get approval from a central Government Department. Similarly, we have the situation, albeit with the existence of the National Roads Authority, where the local government is centrally involved in the actual contracting and provision of the primary road network. Deputy Mitchell and I share membership of a local auth<Col N="848" /> ority. We were recently allocated £95 million in respect of the south eastern motorway yet if a sports club needs £10,000 to do something with its pavilion, it has to apply to a central Government Department for a national lottery grant.</P>
    <P>To some extent we have got it the wrong way around. There is a strong case for centralising some of the delivery of infrastructure that we have seen traditionally in the local government service and shifting to local authorities. I refer to areas such as the education service, the management and running of our schools, hospitals, the health service, areas of policing and, I would argue, aspects of law making, particularly in relation to public order and estate management which in most countries are functions proper to our system of local government.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right when he says that many people talk about local government reform and the devolution of functions to local government. His own wish is that some of these services would come into the local government area. He questioned whether there is a real demand that such services should be in the local government area and that is something that has to be addressed. It is all very well for us to talk about local government reform and subsidiarity but we have to think this through because if we are serious about local government reform and subsidiarity, we have to talk about the devolution of huge chunks of what is currently being done in central Government Departments to the local government service. We also have to think through the logic of that in the context of the size of this country because what we have is a centralised system of Government with much talk about local government which is not carried through in practice.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if we think in those terms about the functions of local government and about creating a local government system where the functions relate to the way people live and the way they have settled, then it has implications for our structures of local government. We have to unclutter our heads about counties and about traditional cities and towns and examine the way people live here in terms of where they settle and ask ourselves basic questions which will give us certain answers about local government. Where do the children go to school? Where is the nearest third level college? Where do people go to the cinema or to the theatre? Where are the local sports facilities? Where is the swimming pool? Irrespective of our system of local government, with all its artificial, 19th century boundaries, what in reality is the way people are relating? If we do that we will find that, for example, the town of Bray has much more in common with Leixlip and Drogheda than it does with Baltinglass, or that the town of Gort in County Galway has more in common with Ennis than it does with Clifden, which is in the same administrative area. That has huge implications for the way we see local government structures.</P>
    <P>I have spoken before about the need for directly elected and full-time members of a <Col N="849" /> greater Dublin Council which would have responsibility for the strategic planning of the greater Dublin area and, within that context, having a network of 15 or 16 borough councils based on the communities and the areas with which people identify so that we would have a Tallaght and a Clondalkin local authority and so on based around the communities in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Minister has chosen to go for what he has called the realistic approach rather than the radical approach because at the start of a new century, we are making a big mistake, in bringing forward local government legislation, if we simply take the 19th century model that we have inherited, that we all know and with which to some extent we have all got comfortable and restate that in modern language and try to make a few adjustments to it here and there rather than taking the blank page the Minister referred to earlier and rewrite the map of local government. We would be doing a better service for local government, local democracy and for the quality and efficiency of the delivery of local services if we took out the blank page and rewrote a structure, a set of functions and an approach to local government which relates to the way people are living now and the way in which we anticipate that our society will develop.</P>
    <P>What we are doing is simply making adjustments to a system which is over 100 years old. We celebrated the 100th anniversary of local government a number of years ago. It was right to do so. It was right to acknowledge the enormous service that both members and officials of local authorities have given this country over that 100 year period. It was right to say that the local government system has served this country well. It took it through the period of independence. It has delivered a huge range of infrastructure, public services, housing and so on. It is right to acknowledge that and pay tribute to the people who put enormous time and effort into it. Acknowledging it, however, and staying stuck in the groove is not doing any service for the future of the people of this country. We should acknowledge it, move on and develop a new system of local democracy and local government.</P>
    <P>I want to make particular reference to a number of specific aspects of the Bill. The first, which I mentioned earlier, is that there is no significant change in the respective roles of county managers and elected councils. I know that some of the representative bodies have suggested to the Minister that he might consider transferring the executive functions of city and county managers to the new CPGs. That is an area we might explore on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about it, one of which arises from a very bad experience I and my party group had in our local authority where despite constituting a quarter of the membership we were frozen out of the chairs of all the SPCs. It has conditioned my thinking in this area. If there is to be a &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo; attitude in local government it would worry me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> We also must look at how accountability will be exercised in such an arrangement and the interface between what are now executive decisions being taken by elected members and the advice given by officials and professional staff.</P>
    <P>On the question of the directly elected mayors and chairpersons, I have already expressed a degree of favour for the idea. To some extent I may have been clutching at any reforming straw in the Bill. I have reservations about the manner in which it is proposed. First, there are no real powers for these directly elected mayors or chairpersons and without real powers for them, we will end up with the worst of both worlds. On Committee Stage, I will propose that these directly elected people have real powers.</P>
    <P>The messages we get on the grapevine that the Minister is contemplating a qualification period for eligibility to stand for election to these positions will not find favour with the Labour Party. If we have people elected to positions then the public ought to have the right to nominate. I am putting down a marker that we are not in favour of the development of a closed shop qualification for these positions.</P>
    <P>On the question of the dual mandate, I agree the time has come to separate the conduct of national and local politics. However, this cannot be done simply by abolishing the dual mandate which allows Members of the Oireachtas to be members of local authorities. We must also make clear what are the functions of national and local government. As long as we continue with a system where functions which ought to exercised at a local level continue to be exercised by central Government Departments and while we continue the absurd &ldquo;over the shoulder&rdquo; supervision of local authorities by the parent Department, we will not be able, even without the dual mandate, to draw the line between the exercise of local and national politics.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposal that members of local authorities should get paid. Down the years they gave of their time literally freely to serve the public. There is a problem developing in local government, and Deputy Gay Mitchell alluded to it, which is part of the manifestation of what is the developing crisis in politics. Many talk about the decline in voter turn out and about people becoming cynical about politics, but that is not the real problem. The real problem is that we will run out of people to serve the public because people are not offering to do it. That is becoming clear at local government level. It has not yet been considered or debated in the context of the crisis in politics. We hear of the cynicism about politicians but that will solve itself in the course of time, because as respect for politics, the service of the public and the elected service of the public declines, the number, and more worrying the calibre, of people willing to do it will decline with it and ultimately the public will be the loser.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that paying councillors alone will resolve that. It will require more. However, it is <Col N="851" /> an indication that this is valuable public service that should be rewarded, properly remunerated, and I support the proposal that it should be done.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the provision in the Bill proposing to remove from urban authorities the sanitary services functions they currently have. I will return to this subject on Committee Stage. There is a very serious worry, which I share, among the urban authorities that the net effect of this Bill will be to further undermine their position and powers and make them more subsidiary to the larger counties or cities they belong to or are beside. There is a corresponding worry about how the SPCs and MPCs were established, giving a low level of representation to some urban authorities. I will return to this also.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages of the delay in the debate on this Bill is that in the 10 months we all had an opportunity to receive submissions of different bodies and to meet them to discuss their views on local government and on this Bill. The submissions from the General Council of County Councils, the Local Authority Members Association and the AMAI were excellent. Like the Minister, although for different reasons, I do not agree with all the points made, but I look forward to teasing them out during Committee Stage. Fine submissions were also made by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Community Workers Co-op, Comhdáil Náisúnta na Gaeilge and many individual submissions, as well as those from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. Senator Jim Walsh, from the Minister's side of the House, did excellent preparatory work for this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> In preparing for this Bill I engaged in consultation with local authority members of my party. An issue of concern to them, and to which I will also return on Committee Stage, relates to the right to time off from work to attend local authority meetings and to participate in them.</P>
    <P>We have waited a long time for this Bill to be brought to the House. We are anxious to facilitate its passage through this House as quickly as we can because within the local government system, there is anxiety that progress should be made on this matter. It is a big Bill and we have to spend a great deal of time in Committee on it. We will not be obstructive. We will be critical certainly and will table a range of amendments. I made the point on the Order of Business that it is not scheduled for the week after St. Patrick's Day. I want to see the Second Stage of this Bill progressed quickly. I appreciate the political difficulties which the Minister has in making progress with the Bill, but sooner or later that will have to be put to a test in a division in the House. I urge the Minister to reschedule the remainder of the Second Stage and we will co-operate with him in having the Committee Stage addressed and in progressing it as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Five examinations of company books and documents are ongoing under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990. The companies involved are Celtic Helicopters Limited, College Trustees Limited, Guinness &amp; Mahon (Ireland) Limited, Hamilton Ross Company Limited and Kentford Securities Limited. The examinations of Celtic Helicopters and Kentford Securities Limited are well advanced, and I expect to receive final reports on these companies in the coming months. The remaining examinations will take additional time and I do not yet have a precise forecast of their likely completion dates.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated previously, the High Court last July quashed my decision to examine the books and documents of Dunnes Stores Ireland Company and Dunnes Stores (ILAC Centre) Limited. An appeal has been lodged on my behalf with the Supreme Court and will be heard on 2 July 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three High Court inquiries are also being undertaken into Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, <Col N="854" /> National Irish Bank Limited (NIB) and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited.</P>
    <P>A total of six investigations have been completed to date. These related to National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, under section 59 of the Insurance Act, 1989, Bula Resources (Holdings) plc, under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990, and Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, Faxhill Homes Limited, Garuda Limited, trading as Streamline Enterprises and IIB Bank Limited, the latter four under section 19 of the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>The reports on Bula Resources (Holdings) plc, Garuda Limited and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited are with the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration. I am not aware of any prosecutions having yet been initiated by the DPP on foot of these reports.</P>
    <P>A total of 29 summonses have since been issued on behalf of my Department against Faxhill Homes Limited and its directors in respect of various suspected breaches of the Companies Acts. The defendants have pleaded guilty to three offences under section 91 &ndash; register of debenture holders &ndash; of the Companies Act, 1963. The case resumed at Naas District Court earlier this week.</P>
    <P>Consultations with my legal advisers are ongoing regarding the possible initiation of summary prosecutions for suspected breaches of the Companies Acts identified in the Bula report. Enforcement action will also be considered in other appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>Last year, my Department secured 46 convictions for various company law breaches which were drawn to our attention. This creditable performance compares with 16 convictions in 1999 and one in 1998.</P>

      <P>Making accurate comparisons between motor insurance costs in Ireland and other European countries is difficult due to a number of factors such as type of insurance cover, age groups, types of vehicles and even regional differences within countries. There are also differences in how compensation for motor injuries is paid in these countries. Countries such as France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden provide compensation benefits almost exclusively through the medium of social security benefits with a high level of earnings-related income support. Ireland, on the other hand, effectively operates two parallel systems of compensation provision, that is, a social security scheme of occupational injury benefits, paid on a flat-rate basis with increases for qualified dependants, while allowing unrestricted access to tort liability claims for compensation for loss of earnings and pain and suffering. A similar system operates in the United Kingdom.</P>

    <P>Source: Commission Européene des Assurances &ndash; CEA &ndash;<i>The European Motor Insurance Market 1997</i>, Brussels, European Union Commission.</P>
    <P>Deloitte &amp; Touche management consultants, were commissioned in 1996 to undertake a study on the economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland. Comparisons with other jurisdictions were made in respect of motor insurance. This study found that premium rates in Ireland were higher than in the other EU countries surveyed. However, it was pointed out in the report that the continental countries differ so much in the areas of methods of compensation and levels of awards from Ireland and the United Kingdom that it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report found that apart from differences in compensation systems, the two major factors driving up the cost of personal injury settlements in Ireland were medical inflation and the high transactions cost of claims, particularly legal costs, including the cost of expert witnesses. In response to these findings, a special working group on personal injury compensation was established under the aegis of this Department.</P>
    <P>The group's second report together with a memorandum for Government containing the main recommendation of the group is now been <Col N="858" /> finalised and will be considered by Government later this month.</P>

      <P>While I am concerned at any factors that might adversely affect industrial employment, there is no evidence available to my Department or the industrial development agencies of any increased tendency for firms to relocate to low wage economies. It is not possible to determine the number of enterprises or sections of enterprises which have relocated to other economies in the past 12 months as statistics are not maintained in this format.</P>
      <P>The trend in employment arising from inward investment continues to be extremely favourable. A record 23,300 new jobs were created in IDA Ireland supported companies during 2000. Allowing for job losses of 8,100, total employment in IDA companies increased by 15,200 to almost 140,000, which represents an increase of 12.2%.</P>
      <P>The reasons for relocation are many, varied and complex, and Ireland has on balance benefited from such movement in recent times due to the strength of our economy. The job losses which are occurring are mainly as a result of the restructuring process which is going on in industry in Ireland whereby activities &ndash; and hence jobs &ndash; at the lower end of the value added scale are being phased out as these activities become uneconomic in an Irish context.</P>
      <P>IDA's policy in this regard is, first, to focus a major part of its efforts on an embedding programme for the existing overseas owned companies in this country. It also seeks to ensure that, as jobs are lost at the lower end of the scale, they are more than compensated for by a greater numbers of jobs at the higher end. This process has been more than successful over the past decade and would not have occurred without IDA's continual active promotion of Ireland as an investment location against competition from other destinations for foreign investment.</P>

      <Quest>if any assistance is being given to Mozambique arising out of the recent disastrous flooding there.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government continues to be concerned about the ongoing situation in Mozambique following the latest flooding which is estimated to have affected some 400,000 people in the Zambezi valley and <Col N="860" /> other low-lying areas in the central provinces of Sofala, Tete and Zambezia. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation has estimated the area of land lost to this year's flooding to be about 22,000 hectares against 167,000 hectares lost in last year's devastating floods which mostly affected the southern provinces.</P>
      <P>The Government has been responding actively to the recurrent outbreaks of severe flooding in Mozambique which has been a priority country for Ireland Aid since 1996. As a substantial supporter of development in that country, we are working closely with other donors to assist Mozambique in its emergency and rehabilitation responses to these crises. We are particularly anxious to ensure that they do not inhibit the overall progress of the country's national development strategy. In addition, therefore, to the £700,000 emergency relief provided by Ireland in response to last year's flooding, an additional £1.6 million was reallocated from the budget for long-term development projects to meet short-term needs. A total of £2.8 million was also allocated at that time for the rehabilitation of roads washed away in the flooding and this particular work is continuing with some of the allocated funding yet to be used. As a committed donor to Mozambique, the Government has been helping to address the flooding problems faced by that country since last year. We will continue to do so long after the current crisis, which is set to continue over the coming months, has faded from international media attention.</P>
      <P>The Irish Embassy in Maputo, which implements our bilateral aid programme, is working closely with the local authorities, UN agencies and Irish NGOs in monitoring and responding in a co-ordinated manner to the current flooding. This week, Mr. Kenzo Oshima, UN Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, has sent the Assistant Emergency Relief Co-ordinator, who served last year as the Special Humanitarian Envoy of the UN Secretary General to the floods in Mozambique, on a mission to review the international support being provided by the UN system in response to the emergency. Both the UN and the Mozambique authorities have a shared wealth of experience in dealing with the flooding which has been augmented on this occasion by a higher level of local emergency preparedness, including emergency food stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the UNICEF response in Mozambique is already reported to be fully funded, the Government stands ready to fund the forthcoming UN emergency appeal. In addition, the embassy in Maputo is actively advancing a number of emergency projects which are being prepared by those Irish NGOs active at the scene of the flooding. The Government will thus continue to support and fund appropriate emergency and rehabilitation responses to the flooding in a manner which reflects its substantial commitment to Mozambique as a priority country for Ireland Aid. The 2001 budget for the Mozambique pro<Col N="861" /> gramme, which will take due account of the impact of the latest flooding crisis, stands at £15.5 million.</P>

      <P>Ireland and the EU have strongly condemned the destruction of statues and non-Islamic shrines by the Taliban authorities. We consider this act of cultural barbarism and religious intolerance to be a crime against the world's common heritage which will irreparably and irreversibly deprive Afghanistan of its unique historical and cultural patrimony. The EU has protested to the Taliban authorities and has requested a meeting with the Taliban leader Mullah Omar in this connection.</P>
      <P>The Secretary General of the United Nations has also appealed to the Taliban leadership to abide by their previous commitments to protect Afghanistan's cultural heritage in general and the two great Buddhist sculptures in Bamiyan in particular.</P>
      <P>Ireland has joined with the international community in urging the Taliban to do all in their power to preserve the unique and irreplaceable relics of Afghanistan's rich heritage, both Islamic and pre-Islamic, as the strongest foundation for a better, more peaceful and more tolerant future for all its people. Moreover, it is incumbent on the Taliban leadership to prioritise the rebuilding of the country, the renewal of the fabric of society and the relief of the immense suffering and deprivation of the people of Afghanistan.</P>

We also discussed developments in the UN Security Council, including our role as chair of the Angola Sanctions Committee, the current sanctions against Iraq and the Middle East peace process, particularly in the context of the Secretary of State's recent visit to the region.

      <P>The expenditure incurred by consular missions headed by honorary consular officers, according to accounts they submitted to my Department in 2000, on items such as telephone calls, fax messages and photocopying was £78,524. In addition, those missions were allowed to retain half the consular fees they collected, an amount of £108,504. Honorary consular officers receive honoraria of £500 a year each, payments which totalled £35,489 last year. The expenditure by the State in maintaining these missions, therefore, amounted to £222,517, but that was offset to the extent of £108,504 by the half of consular fees they remitted to the Department.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that expenditure this year will be £230,000 and that it will be offset to the extent of £115,000 by half of consular receipts to be remitted. There are currently 72 honorary consular officers &ndash; 23 Honorary Consuls-General and 49 Honorary Consuls &ndash; in 50 countries.</P>
      <P>Our network of consulates headed by honorary consular officers is under constant review and is gradually being expanded as the need for new missions emerges and provided persons suitable for appointment are available.

      <P>The question of whether staff of the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs should have an option to return to the Civil Service following vesting day for An Post &ndash; 1 January 1984 &ndash; was discussed in the course of meetings of the post office departmental council working party on the establishment of State-sponsored bodies for the postal and telecommunications services. The outcome of these discussions was summarized and agreed with trade union representatives in Departmental Council Report No. 1635 on 30 December 1983.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2.3 of this agreed report stated, that in the course of the discussions, staff organisations had requested that staff transferring to the new bodies, that is, An Post and Telecom Éireann, be given the option of retaining Civil Service status for a transitional period; or that staff be seconded to the bodies for varying periods depending on the wishes of individuals and/or categories; that transferred staff should have the option of returning to the Civil Service within a specified period; and that all staff should have an option to remain in the Civil Service rather than transfer to either of the new bodies.</P>
      <P>The official side said that it would not be possible to give an option to remain in or return to the Civil Service, and that it would run counter to the purpose of setting up State sponsored bodies, if they were to be staffed by civil servants.

      <P>I welcome the important new report on electromagnetic fields referred to and I will continue to have all developments in this area closely monitored. The report in question is entitled ELF Electromagnetic Fields and the Risk of Cancer. It was published on 6 March 2001 by an independent advisory group with chairman, Sir Richard Doll, to the board of the UK's National Radiological Protection Board &ndash; NRPB.</P>
      <P>The main conclusions of this report are:</P>
      <P>Laboratory experiments have provided no good evidence that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields are capable of producing cancer, nor do human epidemiological studies suggest that they cause cancer in general. There is, however, some epidemiological evidence that prolonged exposure to higher levels of power frequency magnetic fields is associated with a small risk of leukaemia in children. In practice, such levels of exposure are seldom encountered by the general public in the UK. In the absence of clear evidence of a carcinogenic effect in adults, or of a plausible explanation from experiments on animals or isolated cells, the epidemiological evidence is currently not strong enough to justify a firm conclusion that such fields cause leukaemia in children. Unless, however, further research indicates that the finding is due to chance or some currently unrecognised artefact, the possibility remains that intense and prolonged exposures to magnetic fields can increase the risk of leukaemia in children.</P>
      <P>It is clear from this conclusion that the report is somewhat less dramatic than the headline in<i> The</i><i>Sunday Times</i> might suggest. The report also makes recommendations for further research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 2000 the NRPB stated that of the 99.6% children in the UK, the overwhelming majority live in homes where magnetic field levels are below those that the advisory group finds are associated, in some studies, with a small increase in childhood leukaemia. As it is not the practice <Col N="865" /> in Ireland, as it is in the UK, to permit the construction of homes under electricity transmission lines, or permit new transmission lines to overhang existing houses, there are likely to be very few, if any, children here experiencing the prolonged and intense exposures which concern the NRPB's advisory group.</P>

      <P>Working hours in the Defence Forces vary considerably depending on unit, location, appointment held, the type of duty performed and the exigencies of the service at any given time. Accordingly, and due to the distinctive nature of military duties and military life, overtime is not payable to members of the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>In addition to basic pay, military service allowance is payable to members of the Permanent Defence Force up to and including the rank of colonel to compensate personnel for the special conditions associated with military life, such as the unsocial hours of duty, being subject to transfers and a requirement to serve in a wide range of conditions. The current rate in the case of officers is £2,502 per annum, and in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates is £65.83 per week &ndash; £3,423 per annum. Privates with less than three years' service receive £23.70 per week. These allowances are paid, irrespective of the actual hours worked, on a continuous basis, including periods of annual leave and sick leave.</P>
      <P>A range of other allowances are payable to members of the Defence Forces for the performance of particular duties involving service significantly in excess of normal duty hours.</P>
      <P>Permanent Defence Force personnel serving in Border units are in receipt of a Border duty allowance of £59.63 per week in the case of officers and £53.74 per week in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates. All personnel who are engaged on Border duties arising from the foot and mouth scare will be eligible to be paid Border duty allowance in addition to their normal regimental pay and military service allowance.</P>
      <P>The rates of remuneration of the Permanent Defence Force, including military service allowance and Border duty allowance, were determined by the Gleeson Commission in 1990. The commission concluded that military duties were clearly in a distinctive category from other uniformed services and that it would not be appropriate to fix military pay exclusively, or even primarily, by reference to the pay of gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A claim for an additional allowance has <Col N="866" /> recently been made by PDFORRA and will be processed in the normal way through the system of conciliation and arbitration.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted a 2000 area aid application that included a parcel of land in respect of which a dual claim was determined. My Department contacted the person named to clarify the matter on 6 October 2000 and a reminder was sent on 15 November 2000. The person named replied on 14 December 2000, stating that he had been renting the land in question for a number of years. It has now been confirmed by the owner that the disputed land was in fact rented to another farmer in 2000. The person named now accepts this position, which gives rise to an overclaim on his area aid application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances my Department applied the appropriate penalty under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92. The person named claimed a total of 9.69 hectares on his 2000 area aid appli<Col N="867" /> cation. Following processing of his application an area of 6.00 hectares was determined. This represents a difference of 3.69 hectares or 61.50% between the area claimed and that determined.</P>
    <P>Under Article 9 of EU Regulation 3887/92, when the difference is over 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore, in this case as the overclaim is greater than 20%, no area aid related payments can issue in respect of 2000.</P>
    <P>Under EU regulations it is not possible to add extra land on to the 2000 area aid application after 31 May 2000.</P>

      <P>The person named is a participant in REPS and has made application for payment under supplementary measure 6, organic farming. To qualify for payment under this measure a participant must meet a number of conditions, one of which is to be registered as an organic farmer.

I have requested officials of my Department's organic farming unit to contact the person named directly and to explain the situation fully to him.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the year 2001 national reserve. He applied under category D which was reserved for farmers who did not qualify under the priority categories A, B or C because they did not satisfy the age, income, educational qualifications or livestock unit criteria required under those categories. Applicants under category D would only receive allocations if any quota remained after allo<Col N="869" /> cations were made to eligible applicants under categories A, B or C.</P>
      <P>Owing to the large number of applicants for reserve quota, 5,336, and the small amount of quota available for distribution, 6,359 premium rights, all the available quota was allocated to 1,058 eligible applicants in the priority categories.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to special portfolio investment accounts, SPIAs, which were given favourable tax treatment by section 14 of the Finance Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>Income and gains on these accounts, including capital gains, were taxed at a single low rate, initially 10%. Income and gains for this purpose include the growth in the value of any investments in the account. In calculating tax payable investments were deemed to have been disposed of and immediately re-acquired by the designated broker at the end of each tax year. In the context of investment being treated as having been rolled over annually, indexation was not appropriate as indexation does not apply to assets acquired and disposed of within 12 months.</P>
      <P>The accounts were operated by designated brokers who had to be members of the Irish Stock Exchange or of a stock exchange in the EU.</P>
      <P>The rate of tax which originally applied to SPIAs was 10%. This rate was increased to 15% with effect from 6 April 1995 and to 20% with effect from 6 April 1998. As the capital gains tax rate was reduced from 40% to 20% with effect from December 1997, it appears the SPIAs were no longer an attractive investment and that many stock brokers ceased to operate the accounts. Termination of a SPIA would be a matter for agreement between the broker and the client as would any question of commissions.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners inform me that they do not have details of amounts invested in SPIAs or the amounts withdrawn from the accounts in recent years. However, the tax yield from SPIAs has dropped substantially over the past number of years. For example, the yield for 1997-98 was £12 million while the yield for 1999-2000 was just £1.1 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax position on share ownership is as follows. There is a 1% stamp duty charge on share purchases and any gain arising on the disposal of shares may be liable to capital gains tax, CGT at a rate of 20%.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of CGT, the first £1,000 of a chargeable gain accruing to an individual in a year of assessment is exempt from CGT. In the case of married couples, if the assets are held jointly or equally between both spouses, then they can both avail of the £1,000 individual allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that in the United Kingdom an <Col N="875" /> individual has an annual exemption of £7,200. The chargeable amount for individuals for a year of assessment, after taking account of losses and the annual exempt amount, is in effect added to income for tax purposes and charged to tax at the same rates as if it was the top slice of income. Unused income tax reliefs and allowances cannot be set against these net gains. In Ireland, the CGT chargeable is separate and distinct from any liability to income tax.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that a raising of the current annual exemption limit of £1,000 is warranted, especially given the existing low 20% rate of CGT applying. Any call for an increase in the £1,000 limit should be mindful of the practice of share bed &amp; breakfasting &ndash; a process whereby the gain on shares up to the exemption limit is rolled over annually ensuring that no CGT is paid.</P>
    <P>In relation to stamp duty, the yield from stamp duty on share transactions was £182 million for 2000. A reduction of this rate to that which applies in the UK, for example, 0.5%, as proposed by the Deputy, would result in a significant cost to the Exchequer. It has not been demonstrated that the economics of trading/holding Irish shares have been materially impacted by the existence of the 1% stamp duty. I have no plans at this stage to reduce the stamp duty rate on share transactions.</P>
    <P>Share ownership in Ireland has benefited considerably from the reduction in 1997 of the capital gains tax rate, from 40% to 20% and Irish CGT rates compare very favourably with regimes elsewhere. Overall taxation on capital is currently low relative to taxation on earnings and a reduction in capital taxes through the stamp duty rates on investment in shares might be perceived as being contrary to tax equity.</P>
    <P>In addition, Irish companies with substantial operations in this country enjoy the benefit of more favourable rates of corporation tax than is generally the case elsewhere. This should enhance the attraction of shares in Irish companies due to higher net earnings going forward. Owners of shares in this country benefit directly and very significantly from the CGT reductions and they will also benefit indirectly from the move towards a 12.5% corporation tax rate across the board.</P>

      <P>The hospital in-patient enquiry &ndash; HIPE &ndash; system collects a range of information on each discharge from publicly-funded acute hospitals. The system extends to 62 hospitals, includes data on both day cases and inpatients and data are submitted in electronic format on a monthly basis to the Economic and Social Research Institute which has administrative responsibility for HIPE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Data items cover information on the patient, on the source of admission, on diagnoses and procedures, on length of stay in hospital, on patient status and on discharge destination. Patient items include age, sex, marital status and area of residence. Personal identification information is not recorded on HIPE. Source of admission refers to types of elective and emergency admissions and transfers from other hospitals. There is provision on the HIPE record for including up to six separate diagnoses and up to four procedures. These are coded using the ninth version of the International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification &ndash; ICD-9-CM. Consultant codes are also included in an encrypted format. Patient status refers to the public versus private status of the <Col N="877" /> patient and medical card numbers are recorded where relevant. Discharge destination covers normal discharge to home, transfers to other hospitals or convalescent homes and hospital deaths.</P>
    <P>The HIPE data set is also used for the purposes of casemix analysis. This involves the addition of two data items to each discharge record. The first is the diagnosis related group, DRG, to which the patient has been assigned. There are approximately 500 different DRGs and each discharge is assigned to one and only one of these. The second is a data item referring to the major diagnostic category, or MDC. DRGs are grouped into MDCs of which there are approximately 30.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</NameTxt>
      <P>Mental handicap, or intellectual disability as it is alternatively described, is a condition of delayed <Col N="878" /> or incomplete development of the mind which is present at birth or acquired before the age of 18. It results in a greater than average difficulty in learning and can occur with or without any other medical, mental or physical disorder.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Irish Medicines Board has approved clinical trials in patients with mental illness over the years. The majority of these trials were conducted in psychiatric hospitals. Although these patients would not be classified as mentally handicapped, as defined in the above definition, they may have some degree of cognitive impairment. However, the Irish Medicines Board has not approved of any specific trials on persons who were mentally handicapped as defined above.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987 and 1990, require that all clinical trials are approved by the appropriate ethics committee and that informed consent is given by all persons participating in the trials. There are special provisions applying under the Act in the case of patients who, for practical and other reasons, are unable to give their written and signed consent. These provisions require (a) where the patient is capable of comprehending the significance of his consent, he can give his consent to the doctor treating him for that illness in any other manner provided it is clearly given and in the presence of two witnesses who are present at the same time. In such cases the consent must be expressed in writing and be attested by the signature of the two witnesses; (b) where the patient is incapable of comprehending the significance of the consent to be given, he can only participate in the trial if written and signed consent to such participation is obtained from a person, or persons, who in the opinion of the ethics committee is or are competent to give such consent on his behalf. Such a person or persons must be independent of the person arranging the trial and of the doctor or dentist conducting the trial.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that in both these instances it is not permissible to conduct a clinical trial unless the substance or preparation under trial is to be administered for the purpose of saving the life of the patient, restoring his health, alleviating his condition or relieving his suffering.</P>

      <P>On the wider question of shortages in speech and language therapy and therapy grades, my Department has engaged Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a workforce planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including speech and language therapists. Among the matters that this report will address is the number of additional training places required by these professions. This report is expected within the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>In the interim, progress has been made in increasing the number of training places for speech and language therapists and an additional eight places were made available by the colleges for the October 2000 intake of students.</P>

      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy was prepared for the National Radiological Protection Board &ndash; NRPB &ndash; in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the main conclusions of the report are that laboratory experiments have provided no good evidence that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields are capable of causing cancer nor do human epidemiological studies suggest that they cause cancer in general. There is, however, some epidemiological evidence that prolonged exposure to higher levels of power frequency magnetic fields is associated with a small risk of leukaemia in children. In practice such levels of exposure are seldom encountered by the general public in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>In the absence of clear evidence of a carcinogenic effect in adults or of a plausible explanation from experiments on animals or isolated cells, the epidemiological evidence is currently not strong enough to justify a firm conclusion that such fields cause leukaemia in children. Unless, however, further research indicates findings are due to chance or some currently unrecognised artefact, the possibility remains that intense and prolonged exposure to magnetic fields can increase the risk of leukaemia in children. The report also makes recommendations for further research.</P>

      <P>The Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since its commencement, a total of £22 million has been allocated to the scheme which to the end of 2000 has assisted some 80,482 individuals. Accordingly, I propose to have the scheme of community support for older people advertised in both the national and provincial press by the end of March, at which time any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people may submit applications for funding on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Applications received for funding under the scheme from organisations in County Kildare are assessed by the Dublin west regional office of the Department and I can advise that funding of £213,407 was allocated in 2000 under the scheme to organisations in the Dublin west region.</P>
      <P>In administering this and other schemes, the Department must ensure that all applications meet the criteria for funding and that all necessary information and documentation is supplied and found to be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>With reference to the group indicated in the Deputy's question, the information and documentation supplied was not sufficient and funding could not be allocated from last year's allocation. However, additional information which was recently supplied by this group to the Department is currently under consideration and the Department will contact the group shortly regarding the matter.</P>

      <P>In budget 2001, I announced improvements in the qualified adult allowance for those over 66 years of age which will see the maximum rate of this allowance increasing to the full old age non-contributory pension rate over a number of budgets. A major step towards this objective was taken in budget 2001 by providing an increase of £15 per week in the full rate QAA. Following the report of the PPF working group which is currently examining the issues surrounding administrative individualisation, arrangements will be put in place so that part of the pension can be paid directly to the qualified adult.</P>
      <P>On foot of the increase in the QAA the full rate allowance will increase to £79.60 per week from April 2001. This is marginally better than some reduced rate pensions, particularly those based on an average of 15 to 19 contributions. However, as the commitment to increase QAAs to the same level as the old age pension rate is implemented the rates will diverge. In these circumstances, a person being paid a reduced rate pension may be better off being classed as a qualified adult where their spouse-partner are receiving a full rate old age contributory or retirement pension.</P>
      <P>It appears that only a small number of cases, of whom the person concerned is one, are affected and my Department will be in touch with these directly to advise them of the position and their options. Persons will receive the more beneficial payment.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the widest possible coverage for old age contributory pensions. The measure introduced from May 2000 is designed to enable a particular group of people to receive a special pension. This is achieved by affording additional recognition to social insurance contributions paid prior to 1953.</P>
      <P>To qualify a person must have paid at least 260 contributions which may comprise all pre-1953 contributions or a combination of pre and post-1953 insurance. The pension is paid at 50% of the maximum personal rate which from April this year will be £53 per week. To date approximately 13,000 people have benefited from the measure including over 8,000 people who had been in receipt of a <i>pro rata</i> pension at less than 50% of the personal rate and for whom the new pension is more beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contributions made prior to 1953 are still not <Col N="883" /> counted for the purposes of satisfying the average contributions test. Consequently pensioners who were already in receipt of a pension of at least 50% of the personal rate may not improve their position arising from this measure. Any further improvements in this area must be viewed in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>Currently there are 21 medical assessors employed by my Department, including the chief medical adviser and the deputy chief medical adviser. They are qualified and experienced medical practitioners, many of whom have specialist qualifications. They are all fully registered with the Medical Council and are guided by its recommendations with regard to ethical conduct and behaviour and fitness to practice.</P>
      <P>During 2000, a total of 46,566 customers were examined by the medical assessors. Every effort is made to ensure that the interests of persons called for examination are fully safeguarded. Their own certifiers are advised of the forthcoming examinations and invited to submit an appropriate medical report including references to any recent consultant examinations. In addition, it is open to a certifier to attend an examination if he or she so wishes. A nurse is always present during the examination.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy with regard to the number of complaints received by my Department in the last five years is set out in the following table along with the total number of examinations carried out in each of the years involved.</P>

      <P>Control savings of £35.7 million were achieved in the year 2000 on various illness schemes as follows: disability benefit, £19 million; disability allowance, £13.6 million; invalidity pension, £2.9 million; and others, £0.2 million. Control savings are determined following reviews which are carried out on illness claims in payment to verify continued compliance with the conditions for receipt of payment and-or continued entitlement to all payment components, including qualified adult and-or child dependant allowances. These reviews also established whether there were any unreported change in means or family circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Department employs doctors as medical assessors to provide guidance to deciding officers on a person's capacity for work. The medical assessors carry out reviews and medical examinations for this purpose. If, following the examination, the person is considered capable of work, their claim is terminated. In other cases a person may submit a final certificate when they are called for examination. The bulk of the total savings on illness payments, £20 million, arises as a result of these activities.</P>
      <P>Other savings arise from reviews as to whether the customer continues to satisfy the rules of eligibility and rules of behaviour and from means reviews and reviews regarding circumstances carried out by scheme sections or social welfare inspectors.</P>
      <P>Where a claim is terminated following a review, savings are calculated taking account of future payments which will not be made as a result of the control activity. Multipliers vary from 24 for short-term schemes like disability benefit to 136 for invalidity pension. In addition, where an overpayment is assessed, either separately, or as part of this review activity, it is treated as a control saving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern):</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently three different rates of child dependant allowances payable to social welfare recipients, ranging from £13.20 per week to £17 per week. The reasons for this are largely historical. There has been considerable rationalisation of rates over the year, in line with a recommendation made by the commission on social welfare. The number of differ<Col N="885" /> ent rates has been reduced from 36 at the time the commission reported in 1986, down to the current three.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities. The policy direction followed by successive Governments has, therefore, been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit, thus ensuring that the supports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parent or parents.</P>
      <P>The value of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the provision of child income support is reflected in the substantial investment which the Government makes in the scheme. Before we came to office, expenditure on child benefit was £397 million annually. Our first three budgets increased this to £575 million, an increase of more than 40%. The increases I announced in budget 2001 constitute a full-year investment of £330 million in the child benefit scheme. This is only the first of three years of increases which will see investment in the payment rise by £1 billion by 2003.</P>
      <P>By the end of this period, the higher rate of child benefit will be £146 per month, and the lower rate will be £117.50. A family with four children will, in 2003, receive £120 per week in child benefit. This means that we will have moved from a position in 1994 where 70% of child income support for a family claiming social welfare payments was in the form of CDAs to a position in 2003 where CDAs will account for less than 33% of child income support. While the relative importance of child dependant allowances has clearly declined and will continue to do so, support for children of those on social welfare payments has been greatly enhanced. The combined CDA and CB payments have increased by more than double the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>I believe that investment in the child benefit scheme is the correct approach and represents the most effective use of the resources available for child income support. The full year cost of paying all child dependant allowances at the highest rate currently paid is estimated to be in the region of £48 million per annum.</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply to Question No. 193 on 28 February 2001, the Broadcasting Bill, 1999, when enacted, will require, under section 19, the proposed Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to make rules requiring each broadcaster to take specified steps to promote the understanding and enjoyment by persons who are hard of hearing and persons who <Col N="886" /> are blind or partially sighted of programmes transmitted on any broadcasting service.</P>
      <P>The section provides that the commission may set targets to ensure that a specified percentage of programmes use a specified means of promoting the understanding and enjoyment of programmes by such persons. The section also provides for consultation by the commission in drawing up such rules.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that the rights of persons with such disabilities are expressly recognised in broadcasting legislation. It will be a matter for the commission in consultation with interested parties to decide the way forward. During the course of the debate on the Bill, I undertook in both the Dáil and the Seanad to make known to the Independent Radio and Television Commission the strength of feeling and the sense of urgency expressed in relation to the preparation of these rules. I have now written to the commission and asked it, when carrying out its new functions provided for in section 19 of the Bill, to be mindful of the strong views of the Oireachtas regarding the need and the urgency of the need for such rules.</P>

      <P>The feral goats in the Burren National Park are not the property of my Department. They are the responsibility of the landowner on whose lands they are found. Feral goats are wild animals, but are not a protected species for which I have responsibility under the Wildlife Act.</P>
      <P>Since the recent alert in relation to foot and mouth disease, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has been in ongoing consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development regarding the implications of the situation for all wildlife, including feral goats. While I understand that feral goats can contract foot and mouth disease and carry the disease, veterinary advice from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is that no action is necessary at this time in relation to these animals. Consequently, no assessment of the health status of these animals, in the context of the foot and mouth disease scare, has been made by my Department.</P>
      <P>The last cull of feral goats took place in June 1994 and there are no immediate plans for a further cull. The numbers of feral goats in the park are monitored by my Department. No action has been taken to restrict their activity as this would be impractical.</P>

      <P>Extra resources have recently been allocated to the citizenship area of my Department and further staff are due to be assigned shortly, at which stage the number of staff engaged full-time in the processing of citizenship applications will have doubled from nine to 18. These resources will impact considerably on the current processing time.</P>
      <P>As soon as full consideration has been given to this application, I will advise both the applicant and the Deputy of my decision.</P>

      <P>Section 14 of the Children Act, 1908, provides the current legislative response to child begging, including child busking. The Children Bill, 1999, which is at present before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, proposes to update this section by placing an evidential burden on any person who has custody, charge or care of a child to show that he or she did not allow the child to be in any street or public place, or to make house to house visits, for the purpose of begging. Under the Bill, the penalty for allowing a child to beg would be increased from a maximum of £25 to a maximum of £250 for a first offence and £500 for any subsequent offence.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, although most areas experience some form of begging, the problem is most prevalent in Dublin city. The Garda Síochána is actively involved with the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children's Leanbh project, which works with children sighted begging and the parents of these children. Members of the Garda Síochána attached to the Pearse Street, Harcourt Terrace and Store Street stations have been appointed to liaise with Leanbh workers. Ongoing daily contact takes place and monthly meetings are convened.</P>
      <P>Members of the Garda Síochána and the Leanbh project have identified the majority of families whose children beg and Leanbh personnel work with them in a holistic way on an outreach basis. I understand that members of the Garda Síochána on the ground consider that the problem of child begging has decreased since the commencement of Leanbh.</P>

      <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Fees) Regulations, 1993, as amended in 1996, specify the fees that are payable in respect of the grant of a certificate of naturalisation. No fees are payable in respect of recognised refugees, stateless persons, within the meaning of the 1954 UN convention, and programme refugees as defined in section 24 of the Refugee Act, 1996. The following fees are payable in respect of other categories of applicant: £100 is payable by the spouse of a naturalised Irish citizen; the minor child of a naturalised Irish citizen; the widow or widower of an Irish citizen; a person who has renounced Irish citizenship; or a person who had made a declaration of Irish citizenship on foot of marriage to an Irish citizen. All other applicants must pay £500.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the categories of persons who are not required to pay a fee for naturalisation encompass the majority of the applicants referred to by the Deputy. In respect of the remainder, it should be noted that the fees in question have remained unchanged since 1 April 1993. In the circumstances, I have no plans to amend the existing regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
      <P>The national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; is available to all post-primary schools recognised by my Department. The NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible.</P>
      <P>My Department gives assistance to parents where children are excluded from recognised post-primary schools. It endeavours, through a process of consultation with the schools and through the inspectorate, to secure a suitable school placement. My Department has no authority to compel a post-primary school to admit a pupil. It is often necessary to seek a placement in another school. Placement on a Youthreach programme may be an option in difficult cases.</P>
      <P>Recognising the benefits of mainstream education from both an educational and personal development/socialisation perspective, the policy of my Department is to place all such pupils in a mainstream school, regardless of whether they are seeking educational provision through the courts or their cases otherwise come to the attention of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> Many such pupils need additional educational supports, which are identified and put in place in the particular mainstream school. These may encompass the allocation of additional teaching hours to a school to allow the pupil to receive some individual tuition in school, assistance with individual subjects and homework and additional input from the school guidance counsellor.</P>
    <P>Reintegration to school, or commencement in a new school, may involve short days initially, with one to one tuition leading to gradual absorption into full classes, along with continuing one to one tuition. This can allow a pupil to begin to experience some educational success while also allowing school personnel to see this success. This can be a useful step towards successful reintegration.</P>
    <P>In certain cases, if the pupil's behaviour presents acute management problems in class, a classroom assistant may be provided to assist with behavioural difficulties the pupil may have on a day to day basis in class.</P>
    <P>Specialist in-service training can be provided to some teachers in the school, generally to the particular teacher who would be recognised as the key teacher involved in aiding the pupil's full integration into school life. This teacher would have a critical role to play in assisting the full integration of the pupil into normal school life through liaison with the pupil, parents and other teachers.</P>
    <P>Each situation, whether pursued through the courts or otherwise, is approached on a case by case basis from the perspective of seeking to put in place the necessary supports to facilitate a suitable school placement for the individual child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the request by voluntary secondary schools for increased funding, referred to by the JMB. The funding arrangements for the different school types at second level have evolved in a manner that reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. This evolution has generated funding anomalies and structures that lack uniformity and cohesion.</P>
      <P>At the core of funding arrangements at second level is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant. In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, which are privately managed institutions, the Department meets the cost of teacher salaries, excluding the first £400, and allowances, and makes an annual <i>per capita</i> grant towards recurrent costs of schools. These schools may also be eligible for assistance under a range of other grants available under the scheme, including grants for the employment of secretaries and caretakers and curricular support.</P>
      <P>The report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements, including the matter of equity of funding between the different sectors at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
      <P>I showed my commitment by establishing the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in funding. This initiative represents a new approach by my Department and supports the school development planning process. This process will be enhanced if each school is given some flexibility in the deployment of its resources. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking services, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interest of their pupils and for the operation of their schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard <i>per capita </i>grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita </i>grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000. My approach has clearly shown my commitment and determination to <Col N="895" /> improve funding at second level and I intend to build further on progress to date.</P>

      <P>Tá díolúine ó fhoghlaim na Gaeilge <Col N="896" /> faighte ag 1801 daltaí ag an mbunleibhéal agus ag 3708 daltaí ag an dara leibhéal. Tá sé d'acmhainn ag an gclár bunleibhéal agus dara-leibhéal i nGaeilge, mar atá i láthair na huaire chomh maith lena bhfuil beartaithe, freastal ar éagsúlacht fhairsing ábaltachta. Mar sin féin, tá soláthar do dhíolúine ó fhoghlaim na Gaeilge ceadaithe i dtoscaí teoranta ar leith.</P>
      <P>Is féidir díolúine ó fhoghlaim na Gaeilge a dheonadh ar dhalta i gceann ar bith de na cásanna seo &ndash; (a) daltaí a fuair a mbunoideachas go dtí 11 bliain d'aois i dTuaisceart na hÉireann nó taobh amuigh d'Eirinn, (b) daltaí a bhí cláraithe cheana féin mar dhaltaí aitheanta i mbunscoil nó i scoil dara-leibhéal agus atá á gclárú athuair tar éis dóibh tréimhse a chaitheamh thar lear, ar choinníoll go bhfuil trí bliana ar a laghad imithe ón gclárú deireanach sa Stát agus go bhfuil an dalta 11 bliain d'aois ar a laghad ag an athchlárú, (c) daltaí &ndash; (i) a fheidhmíonn go hintleachtúil ar an meánleibhéal nó níos airde ach a bhfuil sainmháchail foghlama orthu atá ar chéim chomh trom sin go dteipeann orthu leibhéil a mbeadh súil leo a bhaint amach i mbunscileanna teanga sa mháthairtheanga, nó (ii) ar measadh máchail ghinearálta foghlama a bheith orthu de thoradh thromlagú intleachtúil (is é sin bac meabhrach) agus a bhfuil ag teip orthu chomh maith leibhéil oiriúnacha a bhaint amach i mbunscileanna teanga sa mháthairtheanga, (iii) measadh máchail ghinearálta a bheith orthu de thoradh thromlagú céadfaíoch, agus a bhfuil ag teip orthu chomh maith leibhéil oiriúnacha a bhaint amach i mbunscileanna teanga sa mháthairtheanga. Ní foláir go ndéanfadh síceolaí cáilithe fianaise ar mháchail dá leithéid a sholáthar, agus, i gcás (iii) thuas, go tabharfadh tuairisc ó speisialtóir oiriúnach leighis tacaíocht dó. Lena chois sin, caithfidh an scoil tuairisc iomlán a sholáthar ar an dalta, (d) Bheadh sé riachtanach do dhaltaí ón gcoigrích, nach bhfuil tuiscint ar bith acu don mBéarla, nuair a cláraítear iad, staidéar a dhéanamh ar theanga amháin, Gaeilge nó Béarla.</P>
      <P>Tugtar údarás do lucht bhainistíochta scoileanna díolúine ó fhoghlaim na Gaeilge a dheonadh de réir na modhanna is na gcritéar sin amháin atá leagtha síos ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time approved undergraduate courses at approved colleges. Students who are repeating a year at the same level are generally not eligible for funding. This condition may be waived in exceptional circumstances such as cases of certified serious illness. There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the free tuition fees provisions to cover students required to repeat a year after failing an examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> The Finance Bill, 2001, contains a provision to allow for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, on fees paid in respect of repeat years of study on courses to which free tuition normally applies. This relief will be effective from the 2001-02 academic year and further information will be available from local tax offices when the Finance Act, 2001, comes into effect.</P>

      <Quest>the number of new applications for new schools, extensions to existing schools at primary and second level, by category, received by his Department in 2000; the number of approvals for such works sanctioned to proceed to the next stage; the average time from first application to approval; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods):</NameTxt>
      <P>The building unit of my Department is processing over 850 major primary and second level school projects. This unprecedented number of projects in planning has been possible as a direct result of the Government's actions in substantially increasing the level of funding for school accommodation over the past few years. Last year, over £200 million was allocated for school accommodation projects. The corresponding figure for this year is in excess of £220 million. Under the national development plan, an unprecedented £824 million has been allocated for school infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to ensure that all capital projects are processed as quickly as possible. However, the Deputy will appreciate that there are inherent delays within this process; for example, the identification and acquisition of a suitable site tends to be a protracted process. The process of advertising and appointing a design team pursuant to EU procurement procedures takes a minimum of three to four months. The obligation on design teams to comply with building regulations, health and safety regulations and other statutory requirements demands careful attention to detail, thus taking time. The procurement of full planning permission and a fire officer's certificate takes a minimum of three to five months. The need to achieve a good competitive tender result requires vigilance in the preparation of tender documents. Finally, current capacity issues within the construction industry are an impediment to expeditious delivery of capital projects.</P>

      <P>The current training for speech therapists involves a four year programme in the school of clinical speech and language studies at Trinity College Dublin. Graduates of the course are professionally recognised as speech and language therapists.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, Dr. Peter Bacon has been commissioned to undertake a workforce planning study on therapists, including speech and language therapists. The study follows the final report of the expert group on various health professions which was established by the Minister for Health and Children in accordance with Labour Court Recommendation 15515. The Higher Education Authority is represented on the steering group for the study and I understand that the report is expected in the near future.</P>
      <P>As an interim response to the shortage of speech and language therapists, arrangements were made to increase the intake into the programme at Trinity College, Dublin, by three to 29 for the current academic year. My Department, in consultation with relevant third level institutions and the Higher Education Authority, has been exploring options for further increases and has been in touch with the Department of Health and Children regarding related issues including the question of clinical placements. Further discussions will be necessary on completion of the workforce planning study. I assure the Deputy that I will continue to liaise with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, in order to ensure an adequate supply of speech therapists.</P>
