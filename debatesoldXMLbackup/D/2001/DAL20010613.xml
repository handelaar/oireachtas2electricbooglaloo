      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. a24, motion re Membership of Committees; No. 49, Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 50, Children Bill, 1999 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages and No. 48, Local Government Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed).

      <P>There are four proposals <Col N="2" /> to be put to the House. Is the proposal regarding the late sitting agreed to?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The last item listed for today is the Local Government Bill, 2000. Before we can agree to extend normal time to facilitate the discussion of that Bill, will the Taoiseach outline whether we are dealing with the Bill as published, or whether the section dealing with the abolition of the dual mandate is to be removed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the answer. It would be pointless to hold a debate if we do not know what we are debating. For reasons of clarity, the House deserves to know whether we are dealing with the Bill as published, or with a Bill which is fundamentally altered. It would make a nonsense of Second Stage if we debate a Bill which will be gutted subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Second Stage debate will be on the Bill as published. However, it would be entirely undemocratic of me not to say that <Col N="3" /> Deputy Howlin, or someone else, might make a good point and the Bill might be amended somewhere along the way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it would facilitate an orderly and reasonable debate if we knew whether the Government, not the Opposition, is pursuing the abolition of the dual mandate or whether it is abandoning it in the Bill? The Second Stage debate would be a nonsense unless that point is clarified.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach is aware, agreement has been reached for the sale of the final portion of Eircom. This has turned out to be an absolute disaster for 450,000 small savers. After the hype, balloons, champagne and traditional music, a combination of the value of the latest offer and the residual value of the Vodafone shares mean that every Eircom shareholder has lost almost 30%. Given that the main reason for these losses was the exaggerated flotation price set by the Government against the advice of Eircom itself, particularly by its chief executive, does the Taoiseach accept there are serious lessons to be learned from this debacle? Will he give an undertaking that in any future sale of State companies the public will be given full and objective information and not conned by the slick advertising campaigns of this Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach analysed the consequences for other State privatisations of the enormous disappointment of so many members of the public who invested for the first time in shares? The cause was the disastrous handling of the flotation of Eircom by the Government, particularly the Minister responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that privatisation of our State assets is a relatively new thing. We should reflect on the last number, of which there have been quite a few with different results, in any future sales. That would be a useful thing to do as we have seen some successes and we have seen some failures.</P>
      <P>I clearly remember the strength of the market at the time of the Eircom flotation and I remember the advice given. The Department of Finance and the Government took a middle road. Some of the advice suggested a higher price which would have created even more difficulties. Some difficulties have been created for people and an analysis of the lessons learned should inform any future sale of assets so that interest is not undermined. I am sure there will be many such sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that <Col N="7" /> there was no public flotation of any other State company to date? Other privatisations were by way of trade sales. Will he inform the House if he has anything other than sympathy to offer the shareholders? There are 480,000 who have borrowed or invested pension funds and they are at a loss of over 30%. The Government grossly misled those shareholders by not informing them that the management of the company disagreed with the flotation price. Will the Taoiseach at least apologise to the small savers of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan will recall, as he was finance spokesperson at the time, the very careful warnings given about share options. It was made very clear that buying shares did not guarantee a win.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will remember that there was a number of months when many small shareholders sold up and were well advised to do so in many articles written by financial journalists as well as by the market. It is not for the Government or anyone else to go against the market but I hope some of what is happening will help to minimise losses. I believe it will turn things around in some cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten days ago the Minister for Public Enterprise announced the trade sale of Aer Lingus and discussed this matter with the trade union representatives of those companies last week. Yesterday the Taoiseach told the House that there was no trade sale and that the Government decision to float the company stood. What is Government policy? Is the Taoiseach <i>ad idem</i> with his Minister for Public Enterprise? Do they have any communication about this matter and why is the Minister flogging the company around the world when he says no decision to do any such thing is extant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the suggestion that Aer Lingus should be sold for £300 million is an insult to the national carrier and to everyone who works for Aer Lingus? Is he aware that slots at Heathrow Airport alone which are enjoyed by Aer Lingus would be worth approximately £300 million? The brand name which was so good in the past would still have value if the company were set right. Does the Taoiseach agree that in the first instance the company must be restored to good health before the Government decides either to proceed by way of trade sale or flotation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decision back in December 1999 authorised the Minister to <Col N="8" /> initiate a process leading to an initial public offering of shares in Aer Lingus. Over the last few years those discussions have continued. As Deputy Howlin said, the issue with the unions was the shareholding of 9.9% of the company for Aer Lingus employees in addition to the current employee shareholding of 5%. As I said yesterday, the Minister has appraised the Aer Lingus unions of these developments in discussions last week and agreement has been reached on the resumption of discussions with the unions on increasing the current shareholding of 14.9%. The Minister's advisers and the company's advisers have been looking at alternative sale options for the airline, taking soundings with potential investors or buyers and will be reporting back to her. There are no other changes in that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The workers in Aer Lingus will be entirely confused by that response. Is the Taoiseach now telling the House regarding the announcement made by the Minister for Public Enterprise that Aer Lingus would be sold by way of trade sale, that that option was actively being considered and that the spokesperson for the Department of Public Enterprise who on 6 June was reported as saying that that was the view of both the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Taoiseach &ndash; that all of that is factually incorrect and that there is no trade sale? Is he saying that the decision to float the company is the avenue being pursued as agreed by the Government last December? Is that what the Taoiseach and the Government are telling the workers and the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying the same, once again, to the workers: the Government decision of 14 December 1999 authorised the Minister for Public Enterprise to initiate a process leading to an initial public offering of shares in Aer Lingus is still the Government decision. There is no change.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor does it mean that the IPO has been abandoned. The Government remains, as it has been since December 1999, committed to the privatisation of Aer Lingus as being the best option for the airline to go forward and it is appropriate, therefore, that all the commercial issues facing the airline and developments in aviation globally should be reviewed by the Minister, <Col N="9" /> as she said, for the privatisation of the company.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Brendan Smith, if that is in order. I am disappointed to see that not alone is the Chamber emptying but also the public gallery. I play better in front of bigger crowds but I will do my best over the ten minutes available to me.</P>
      <P>We are all conscious of the trust and confidence placed in Members when they are elected to this House. It is a great honour given by the electorate and, while we all have certain rights as Members, we should remain conscious of the responsibility that being a Member brings. We should not abuse that privileged position. Unfortunately, in recent years we have seen abuses in a number of cases, across party lines, and the tribunals are dealing with those matters at present. There is a worrying cynicism among the public. For the future of our democracy it is important that the public have complete faith and confidence in the House and the way we do business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of TDs and Senators who come to the Dáil and Seanad carry out their duties in an honest and hard working fashion. They do a difficult job, although the public and <Col N="13" /> media often have a go at that. For most Members, it is a job that takes up a lot of their time and family life often suffers as a result. However, we know the sacrifices before we come into the job and are prepared to accept those in carrying out the duties as Members of the Houses.</P>
    <P>Most Members will welcome this Bill. The establishment of a Standards in Public Office Commission can only help in restoring public confidence in the House and the Members. However, I am concerned about the rush to transparency in recent legislation. There seems to be a race to find out which party is whiter than white. The only certainty that can be given about parties in the House is that there are no angels in any of them, much as the public might want that. All parties have faults and failings and it is important that, whatever wrongs were done in the past, Members and parties learn from their failings and put in place proper procedures and rules to ensure that we do not have a repeat performance.</P>
    <P>Each year Members are asked to provide a declaration of interests. I have no difficulty in providing such a declaration and a list of properties or share dealings. However, the way that declaration is used is unfortunate and unnecessary. Why is it necessary to publish that information in newspapers around the country? Journalists can be very selective in the way they use this material. This declaration could be provided to the Ceann Comhairle or the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. That body, if it was found that a conflict of interest emerged during the year, could call the person involved to account. If the matter needed to be made public at a later stage, so be it. However, it is totally unnecessary to produce this declaration each year and then to have selective use made of it in the media.</P>
    <P>It is vital that a good cross-section of people run for public office. A good mixture is important in any organisation. This mixture is certainly not the case in terms of gender balance in the House at present. It is important to have a good mix of men and women, young and old, if we are to have a feel for what is going on in the country. We need to be in touch with different sectors and groups. Likewise, it is important to have business people, teachers, farmers, trade unionists and ordinary working people represented. We do not want a situation where the House is full of lawyers, barristers, teachers, bookmakers or anything else. We need a good cross-section.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that recent legislation is part of a competition to see which party is the cleanest. Some of the legislation is preventing good people from running for election. A number of people outside the House see some of the legislation and its demands as an intrusion into their private lives. That should not be the case. The evidence emerging from the tribunals has opened the eyes of the public. Unfortunately, the perception held by many has become a reality. We will have a major problem trying to undo the damage that has emerged from the tribunals. People are reluc<Col N="14" /> tant to be critical of them in that it might indicate they are trying to hide something. The costs of the tribunals are worthy of comment and they must not be allowed go out of control. Nobody knows what they will cost before they finish. There are lessons to be learned in terms of how we do our business and set up tribunals.</P>
    <P>We have too many Oireachtas committees. If we had fewer committees with greater powers and resources, we could do some of the work that the tribunals are now doing. I think Deputy Carey stated it was not appropriate for Members to be members of local authorities and that if they were doing their jobs properly, they would have enough work to do without taking on that of local authorities. Deputy Dempsey shares this view, but a small group of Members in this House have a different view. We will be dealing with the legislation over the&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a concern about the negative public perception of politics in general. All parties have endeavoured in recent years to rectify this. We have had Members from different parties who got into trouble over the past year or two in a very public way. The reaction when a Member is in trouble is very predictable. Usually, it is a venial sin if the Member is a member of one's own party and a mortal sin if he is a Member of another party. We should be more consistent and fair when dealing with such issues. Otherwise we would not be doing ourselves any great service.</P>
      <P>A new commission is to be set up which will deal with complaints about the actions or omissions of persons in public life. This will improve standards in general, although most people try to carry out their duties in an honest, efficient way. They serve the public as best they can for no ulterior motive. In order to restore the public's confidence in the political process, it is vital that we have a greater consensus among the parties and that the Oireachtas is given much greater resources and power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to discuss this important legislation. What Deputy Power said in his closing remarks is very important. The workings of the Oireachtas and the assistance given to Members should be improved. In recent years, the support available to Members has improved, but there is an obvious case for further improvement. Most Deputies would like to have a second secretary or research assistant, because those with a constituency based secretary know of the difficulties encountered in Dáil Éireann through not having any secretarial back-up or research assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is being discussed against a <Col N="15" /> background of a small minority of politicians who engaged in corrupt practices over the years. Their actions cannot be excused under any circumstances. The generation of politicians in this Dáil and the preceding one has had to frame legislation to deal with transgressions that took place over a period many years previously.</P>
    <P>I welcome the enactment of a number of Bills in the last few years. The Public Service Management Act, 1997, put in place a more modern accountability framework for the Civil Service. The Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, gives Oireachtas committees increased powers of investigation in areas of public concern. It also can compel witnesses to attend hearings and respond to questions. The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, provides mechanisms for dealing with conflicts of interest.</P>
    <P>Bills laid on the foundation of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and the electoral Acts of 1997 and 1998 seek to achieve fairness in the electoral process. The Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Bill, 1999, provides similar measures for the local authority issue.</P>
    <P>Greater funding should be made available by the State to political parties. Whether small or large, parties should be treated fairly. There are fewer and fewer people taking part in voluntary political activity. All political parties have this problem. It is not easy to fund parties on an ongoing basis to provide for research and assistance and to provide backup staff at headquarters level. I note the Minister for Finance has recently published a Bill that will provide for increased funding for parties. That is a welcome measure.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that there are a small number of people who contribute financially to voluntary activity, such as recreational or sporting clubs or political parties. The people who complained about the relative inactivity of political parties with regard to recent referenda would not contribute to anything themselves. They would not contribute to a local sporting or voluntary organisation, never mind a political one. There are fewer people available who are prepared to run Irish nights, whist drives, etc., to raise money for political parties. Therefore, we should ensure that all political parties are funded by the State on a fair and progressive basis. It is only by having well funded political parties, with research facilities, capable of modernising their systems, that we will enhance the democratic process.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power also spoke about the work of committees. All of us find, particularly Government backbenchers who are on a number of Oireachtas committees, that committees create a very serious burden of work for Members.</P>
    <P>I am a Member of the Committee on Members' Interests. In recent months, it had many long meetings to hear submissions and consider the drafting of a code of conduct for Members of Dáil Éireann. The committee, chaired by Deputy Kil<Col N="16" /> leen, has only five Members. It operates in a non-partisan manner. I heard Deputy Killeen in his contribution to this Bill state that, at all times, decisions have been reached on the basis of unanimity and that, where there were divisions, they did not occur on a political party basis. That shows the strength of committees and their potential to carry out useful work. In the preamble to the code of conduct for Members of Dáil Éireann, we emphasised that it is in the individual and collective interests of Members to foster and sustain public confidence in their integrity as individuals and in Dáil Éireann as an institution. It is also stated that to ensure this, Members should at all times be guided by the public good and ensure that their actions and decisions are taken in the best interests of the public. If I remember it correctly, the first paragraph of the code stresses that Members must, in good faith, strive to maintain the public trust placed in them and exercise the influence gained from their public office to advance the public interest alone. It is important that we have that code of conduct within which we can operate.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that since Dáil Éireann was established, the overwhelming majority of Members on all sides have worked to achieve the highest standards. However, a very small number have damaged the standing of politics in recent years.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that the Bill provides for the establishment of a standards in public office commission to investigate complaints involving officeholders and Members of the Oireachtas, creates tax clearance requirements for politicians and senior public servants, provides for the codes of conduct to apply to officeholders, Members of the Oireachtas and members of the public service and establishes a regime for dealing with breaches of the legislation. Everyone in the House welcomes the introduction of the legislation. The Minister of State indicated that certain aspects of it could be amended or improved on Committee Stage. I welcome his openness in stating that there are some areas which could be improved.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was initially published in July 1998, it was referred to the Committee on Members' Interests. The committee then held meetings with officials of the Department and put forward suggestions. I am aware its members are pleased that a number of those suggestions were taken on board and the Minister of State has indicated that some of them will be provided for on Committee Stage. The proposals in the Bill are of considerable consequence for the workings of our democratic institutions. They are concerned with ensuring that the people who lead our society and run our public services are seen to act in an ethical and impartial manner. The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, requires Oireachtas Members, Ministers and most high-ranking public servants to provide details of financial interests, if any exist, relating to activities outside their official duties.</P>

        <b>:</b> That is correct. Deputy McGrath and I will each speak for ten minutes.</P>
      <P>One of the most striking aspects of the action taken by the Government in respect of dealing with the responsibilities of public officeholders and public representatives and coming to terms with corrupt or dubious practices is the dreadfully slow pace at which it has brought forward legislation. Legislative proposals have emerged in a drip, drip fashion for several years. For example, the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, had its genesis in the mid-1990s but it is only now being debated in the House. In the interim there has been a torrent of revelations concerning the interface between different big business concerns and politicians and the involvement of local government and planning interests.</P>
      <P>People believe there is a need for an immediate and merciless crackdown not only on open corruption but also on the cronyism and everything else attaching to the relationship between business and politics. It has been several years since the Ansbacher scam was revealed. We know that 120 anonymous individuals defrauded the tax system and were involved in shenanigans as a result of their private greed. Years later, however, we still do not know the identities of these people and we do not know when the matter will be resolved.</P>
      <P>Some months ago, because the local authority does not sweep the streets often enough, litter blew into the gardens of a number of my constituents in a certain housing estate in Dublin West. They were issued with an on-the-spot fine of £50, which was followed some weeks later by a threatened summons to the District Court with the advice that they could be fined up to £1,500 under one or other of the Litter Acts if they did not comply. Terrified of the courts, which most ordinary people are, they paid the £50 fine. In addition, an unfortunate person who is addicted to heroin is currently serving a six year sentence &ndash; reduced, on appeal, from nine years &ndash; for snatching, with no violence involved, a handbag containing approximately £1,000 worth of goods or whatever. What is the difference between those involved in the Ansbacher scam and the individuals to whom I refer? The difference is that the small people are immediately hit with the full rigours of the law while the big fish are allowed to swim away to enjoy the benefits of their offshore accounts. We do not know whether the latter will ever be brought to book. Is it any wonder ordinary people are so cynical about the political establishment &ndash; this was dramatically illustrated in the recent vote on the Nice treaty &ndash; when they see this type of double standard in operation in political life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State explained that the Standards in Public Office Bill provides for the estab<Col N="18" /> lishment of a new standards in public office commission with wide investigative powers relating to so-called specified acts. He also indicated that its provisions relate to officeholders and extend to Members of the Dáil. I welcome this development but I must complain about the slow pace of progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the recent past we witnessed the most outrageous actions on the part of officeholders in respect of their relationship with business interests. The sale of the second mobile telephone licence and the Esat Digifone affair represent an outrageous abuse of his office by the then Minister. It is amazing how silent the political establishment has remained in respect of this matter. People are horrified by the fact that a private businessman was sold the second mobile telephone licence &ndash; as everyone knows, this was tantamount to giving him his own diamond mine &ndash; for £15 million, which, inevitably, he sold to a multinational and walked away with a personal profit of £230 million. That is bad enough, but we now know of all kinds of dubious dealings of a business nature between the Minister who granted that licence and the beneficiary. There is only one word for this &ndash; corruption. I do not care whether it is proved in a court of law, but ordinary people know that this type of behaviour is corrupt.</P>
    <P>Another provision in the legislation is for codes of conduct for office holders, Ministers and Members of the Oireachtas. I am in favour of that, but I wish to make a few suggestions as to what might be included in that code of conduct apart from the obvious, such as favours and inappropriate and improper dealings between politicians and businessmen. It should, for example, be in the code that any Member of the Dáil would be prevented from having outside employment. It is outrageous that Members of the Dáil act as paid consultants to big business concerns. That is a conflict of interest. One cannot purport to serve the ordinary people while at the same time be a consultant to big business and possibly multinational concerns whose interests can often be diametrically opposed to the interests of the ordinary people. The moonlighters down at the Four Courts should also be banned. Certain Members of the Dáil travelling the world as directors of multinational companies and financial institutions and showing their faces once a month in the House should be banned from doing so because it is wrong. If we are serious about a code of conduct, we will make fundamental changes.</P>
    <P>The proposals unveiled in recent days leave me cynical about the intentions of the Government and its seriousness in transforming politics and political actions. The Ministers for Finance and the Environment and Local Government have in recent days increased to millions of pounds the moneys from the taxpayer to political parties. The Ministers have set aside a major slush fund for political parties. The party leaders' allowance legislation which is to come before the Dáil shortly provides for the auditing of the allowance, <Col N="19" /> for which I called and with which I agree. However, the allowance can still be used for entertainment or an extra honorarium for a party leader. This is provided for in the Bill. After what we have seen in the tribunal regarding a previous leader of the country and the grotesque abuse of the party leaders' allowance which is supposed to be used to aid public service, to come back with the same provision in new legislation beggars belief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to do that. I thank Deputy Higgins for sharing his time with me. I welcome the opportunity of addressing the House on the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is a tremendous privilege for any Member to walk through the doors of the House as an elected representative of his peers in his area. For anyone who has been a Member for a long time, such as the Acting Chairman, it is a fantastic privilege that people consistently have faith in one to re-elect one on many occasions over a long period. It stands well to the country that so many public representatives have long tenures of office.</P>
      <P>Long before we had the Ethics in Public Office Act or the Standards in Public Office Bill, our predecessors served the country well and brought it quickly from a state of anarchy in the early 1920s after the Civil War to a highly democratic state. The gun was taken out of politics to a great extent by our predecessors and we owe a debt of gratitude to them. It should be mentioned that they did it on salaries that were a mere pittance and without all the rules and regulations governing declarations. It can be said that, almost across the board, they were highly respectable people.</P>
      <P>There have been difficulties recently, but it is only fair to say that it is confined to a group of people who are small in number compared to the numbers who have been Members of the House. When one considers the average tenure of office of Members is 11 years, the fingers have been pointed at a very small number. Taken in the overall context, the number is quite small. Bad apples exist in any profession as much as in politics. What we do is very much in the public arena and it is perhaps because of that we are more open to being targeted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was elected 12 years ago this week, I was landed into an office with a secretary and phone but no fax. Assistance in becoming accustomed to the parliamentary mode and getting to know how things work was non-existent. One was left to paddle one's own canoe and work one's way through the system to find out how it worked. At the same time, one had to cater for one's constituents and hope that one might be re-elected. Matters were even worse when the Acting Chairman was elected. They have improved <Col N="20" /> since and I acknowledge the improvements made. We now have offices of our own with fax machines and other modern technology. That is a major step forward.</P>
    <P>We need further support, however. Whereas modern society has improved with communications and so on, it has increased the burden placed on us as public representatives. The volume of e-mails one receives on a weekly basis to which one must respond with the volume of other work curtails the amount of time one can spend on research, reading through important material and constituency work. There is a strong case for additional support by way of researchers. I hope the Minister for Finance, who has been very good to Deputies, will respond to those requests.</P>
    <P>There is a long tradition in Ireland of public representatives being very close to the people. We have a system where one's constituents are in touch with one regularly and one meets them on a regular basis. Compare that to the system across the water. I remember once having a discussion with a parliamentary colleague from the United Kingdom who told me that he was very close to his constituents in that he went to his constituency once a month where he went to the club to meet his constituents. That was his regular contact with them. He would not survive very long in our system. That is something we must bear in mind, especially given the future debate on the dual mandate. What should be our reaction to that? Removing it would take away some of our burden of responsibility and it probably will happen in time.</P>
    <P>Even in the short time I have been a Member, tremendous changes have occurred in the declarations one makes. One must declare what one receives and its origins. I have no difficulty with that because I do not have very much in that line. I have not accumulated a great deal of material which means it is easy for me to fulfil my obligations. We must be conscious, however, that some worthwhile people, be they from trade unions, business or the professions, do not want to be exposed in that way and what they have to be made known. We could be reaching the stage where we are, perhaps, turning away good people. People often say to me they would not have my job for anything. They would not do it because of the exposure, their every move being watched and everything they have being made public. Many people could not cope with that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power referred to the interests people might have in property or shares which they would have to declare as politicians. He said that perhaps it is time those were not made known and used for media purposes. It should be available to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Ceann Comhairle or a committee comprising the Ceann Comhairle and the Clerk of the Dáil, rather than being available for use in the media. In recent weeks an article appeared in a newspaper about millionaire Members of this House. The people I know within this House who are wealthy made their money independently of <Col N="21" /> their membership and of their service here. Many of them would be far richer had they not given up their time to be here. We have moved into a new arena and the difficulties politicians created for themselves are being exposed in tribunals and debated in the media.</P>
    <P>I am also a member of a local authority which is currently reviewing its development plan. This is a long and arduous job and has been continuing for more than 12 months. We have now come to the stage of deciding on the rezoning of lands. The management of the council brought in a team of consultants to do a report on rezoning submissions. The report is almost totally negative and recommends almost no change from what was originally proposed. The consultants have made major errors in some of their reviews and have included incorrect factual information. In one case the consultants said an application to have a development in a village four miles from Mullingar would not be practical because it could not be connected to the sewerage system in Mullingar. The consultants were out of touch with the need to develop local communities, to give them power and to maintain local schools, post offices and other services.</P>
    <P>When these decisions are debated in public it will be easy to point the finger at politicians. Some people will ask why we want to rezone certain lands for development. It will be difficult to argue that land should be included in a development because it would be good for the local environment and community. The voluntary housing organisation, Respond, has done excellent work in providing social housing and mixed developments. That organisation made a submission to rezone certain lands to provide 300 houses, a community centre, shops, swimming pool and so on to make a properly developed and resourced community. The application was reviewed negatively by the consultants. One questions how in touch are these consultants with the needs of communities and with the need to develop integrated communities such as that proposed.</P>
    <P>Politicians must make the final decisions and it is easy for someone to ask why we make these decisions. Rather than giving us an opportunity to respond properly and to state the reasons for a decision, it is often easier to assume politicians make decisions to satisfy big business or some other interest. It is easy to cast a shadow over someone even when there is no justification for it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the many useful contributions to the Standards in Public Office Bill. The attention Deputies have given to this legislation in committees and on Second Stage has been commendable. I have already indicated to the House that various points already made on the Bill during the course of committee <Col N="22" /> discussions will form the basis of Committee Stage amendments.</P>
      <P>I have also noted that the report of the Committee on Members' Interests, in relation to a code of conduct for Dáil Éireann, has also suggested various amendments to the Bill. These suggestions, some of which have been repeated during the course of this debate, have been examined carefully. I anticipate bringing forward Committee Stage amendments on foot of that examination. To the extent that they are not already taken into account, the remarks made by Members on Second Stage are being considered with a view to making the Standards in Public Office Bill, when passed, a serious and effective Act.</P>
      <P>The involvement in the debate of Deputies who are members of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service and the Committee on Members' Interests and the professional understanding of the State and its institutions which Members of the House have developed mean that a considerable degree of expertise is being applied to the consideration of this Bill. We can look forward to a productive discussion on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Discussions of the Standards in Public Office Bill during the course of the Second Stage debate has, from time to time, extended into discussion of issues not addressed in the Bill. The Bill is a discrete Bill with a specific remit. There are important issues related to ethics and probity in public life which are beyond its scope. It is but one part of a broad legislative initiative which, taken in overall terms, will radically change the legislative structure within which people in public life do their business. More importantly, it will make the way we conduct our business more transparent and less open to abuse.</P>
      <P>The Bill will build on the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, to ensure greater transparency in the conduct of public business by Members of the Oireachtas, office holders and other public servants. The introduction of tax clearance requirements, codes of conduct and stronger investigation mechanisms will underpin the high standards of probity and conduct to which the bulk of those in public life strive to adhere. The Local Government Bill, 2000, will similarly introduce new measures for greater transparency in local government and local politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation in relation to lobbyists will perform a similar service in relation to the interactions between those in public life and those whose profession it is to seek to influence their decisions. The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill will update and broaden the scope of the criminal law in relation to corruption. Whistleblowers legislation will protect persons who report unlawful activities. Where matters raised in this debate are likely to be addressed not in the Standards in Public Office Bill but in one of the other legislative initiatives currently under way, I will make a point of bringing the contents of this debate to <Col N="23" /> the attention of the relevant Ministers or Departments.</P>
    <P>Deputies have given a broad welcome to the Bill and I am pleased about that. While the welcome has been broad it has been tinged with a certain regret that circumstances are such that this Bill is necessary. None of us is happy about legislation of this type. We would all wish to live in a world where the personal moral and ethical standards of public representatives and public servants were beyond question and were known to be so. As Members of the Oireachtas we impose on ourselves, and to an extent on other public servants, greater transparency in the disclosure of personal and financial interests than applies in almost any other walk of life. I do not believe this carries an implication that we are less upstanding than any other segment of the population. Rather it reflects our own understanding that in the work we do we act as trustees on behalf of the population. Their common property vested in the State, their common heritage, their shared values, and their democratic institutions, are all given to us to manage for them, as a trust. We impose stringent standards on ourselves because we understand that, in the long run, we must be seen to operate to the highest standards, if we are to maintain the public trust.</P>
    <P>It is to underpin the public's trust and confidence in its representatives and institutions that we are engaged in legislating in respect of standards and probity in public life. There may well be points of detail, as we discuss this Bill further, on which there will be disagreement but I believe there is little disagreement about the overall goal of ensuring that we continue to have a public service and a political system worthy of the esteem of our citizens.</P>
    <P>I turn at this stage to some of the specific points made on the Standards in Public Office Bill during the course of our discussion. I apologise if I miss any points that Members regarded as particularly salient, but I am sure we will get back to them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion of the issue of tax clearance, and in particular the consequences of failure by a Deputy to produce a tax clearance certificate. The Bill provides that if a Deputy fails to provide a tax clearance certificate, this would be the subject of a report to the Committee on Members' Interests which would lay it before the relevant House. The House could then decide on what action to take on foot of this. This action could involve suspension, for example. If a Deputy or Senator continued to fail to comply with the tax clearance provisions, the relevant House could consider extending such a suspension.</P>
    <P>I should clear up any suggestion that the fact that a Deputy was in dispute with the Revenue would lead to any special difficulty. The Bill provides a mechanism that, in such a case, a Deputy will not be required to provide a tax clearance <Col N="24" /> certificate until the appropriate Revenue appeals mechanisms have been gone through.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell mentioned that there are special considerations which apply in the case of judges and questioned whether the Bill is correctly structured in relation to tax clearance for judges. We have, in fact, anticipated this point and an appropriate amendment will be put forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputies have also referred to the importance of maintaining confidentiality in proceedings of the commission or of the Members' Interests Committee. The point made, as I understand it, was that a Member should be protected from inappropriate disclosures where possibly unsustained allegations might be exaggerated and distorted as they passed through the &ldquo;rumour mill&rdquo; to the point where the reputation of a person could be seriously damaged. In that regard, the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, already provides that it is an offence under the Act to disclose information obtained by being present at a sitting of a select committee or of the commission held in private. These provisions will continue to apply and will extend to the new commission proposed under the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the importance of balancing the extensive powers of the commission against the danger of vexatious or unsubstantiated complaints. The Bill has introduced a number of important safeguards here. The extensive powers of the commission will not be automatically invoked any time a person walks in off the street and makes an allegation. In particular, the commission has been given a mechanism &ndash; the inquiry officer &ndash; to allow for preliminary inquiries which will filter out frivolous or vexatious complaints, or those for which there is insufficient <i>prima facie</i> evidence. The commission will have power to dispose of frivolous and vexatious complaints, or minor complaints not worthy of a full commission investigation, at any stage. The new complaints under this Bill, in relation to the so-called &ldquo;specified acts&rdquo; must relate to matters of significant public importance, so trivial or minor matters should not be taken up.</P>
    <P>In relation to complaints made about a Member of the Oireachtas, through the clerk, to the relevant Oireachtas committee, the clerk has been given a new power which did not exist under the Ethics Act, to rule out complaints where there is not sufficient <i>prima facie</i> evidence to sustain the complaint. Previously, the clerk could only refuse a complaint which he or she considered frivolous or vexatious.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will agree that we have tried to build into the Bill an appropriate set of protective mechanisms to balance the need to have effective investigative mechanisms in place with the need to ensure that individuals are not left excessively vulnerable to deliberate mischief.</P>
    <P>The burden of paperwork and administration arising from ethics and electoral legislation has also been mentioned. The existing legislation in <Col N="25" /> this area, the ethics Acts and the electoral Acts, already impose substantial obligations in relation to annual statements of registerable interests, <i>ad hoc</i> statements where proximate conflicts may arise and disclosure of political donations. The Government considers it important therefore that this Bill should not unduly increase the obligations for Members and other persons covered by the Act. In fact, there are provisions which should make compliance with the requirements of the electoral Acts and ethics Acts a little simpler, if anything, and we will have Committee Stage amendments to go some way further on this point.</P>
    <P>We must accept, of course, that the greatest burden may arise where someone is actually under investigation and that certain legal costs might arise. While the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, makes limited provision for award of costs to an individual, the investigations of specified acts under this Bill may turn out to be more complex and difficult than ethics Act investigations. For this reason, I will be putting forward amendments in relation to the issue of legal costs.</P>
    <P>Certain Deputies also raised the issue of the level of resources available within the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Deputy McGrath referred to it again during this morning's debate. This is not something which is addressed in the Standards in Public Office Bill but I understand that the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas is evaluating tenders for the provision of consultancy services to perform an international benchmarking study on staff resources and grading, including analysis of the staff resources and grading required to service both Houses and the committees, and a review of the levels of non-Civil Service staff resources which are made available to assist Deputies and Senators in the performance of their parliamentary duties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmins mentioned section 15 of the Bill, dealing with obstruction of the commission or the committee in their investigations. It is, of course, essential to have such a provision. Without it the whole investigatory structure of the Bill could be rendered ineffective. The commission and the committees can also seek discovery of documents. In that regard, I would also draw the attention of Deputies to section 17 which makes it an offence to deliberately destroy documents relevant to an investigation. In certain circumstances this could be very important.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGuinness and others stressed that this Bill also deals with civil and public servants. He is perfectly right. As has been mentioned already, a code of conduct or &ldquo;Code of Standards and Behaviour&rdquo; for civil servants is already under consideration by a joint committee. It is anticipated that this will serve as the code to be applied to civil servants under this Bill. This code is also the subject of discussions with civil service staff interests.</P>
    <P>Civil servants will also be amenable to the Standards in Public Office Commission, where appropriate, and complaints about them can be <Col N="26" /> made to the commission in the same way as complaints about office holders. Civil servants, for this purpose, will include special advisers. This reflects the reality that, in modern times, public servants may exercise substantial discretionary and decision making powers, and they must be subject to appropriate rules.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Higgins raised the issue of former senior civil servants taking up positions after retirement, perhaps in privatised State enterprises. He will be interested to know that the draft Civil Service code of conduct addresses this particular area. The draft code provides for an outside appointments board which would consider cases where the nature and, indeed, terms of such intended appointments could lead to a conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance is working on, and hopes to promulgate shortly, a detailed code of practice for the governance of State bodies which will incorporate a requirement that State bodies develop codes of conduct for their employees and directors. I see this as being complementary to the provision for codes of conduct within this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies Fleming, Rabbitte and others raised the issue of corporate donations. Deputies will be aware of developments earlier this week in this regard. This important issue is one which will be the subject of discussion in regard to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The Standards in Public Office Bill was never intended to address this particular topic.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killeen mentioned a number of technical issues relating to the 1995 Ethics Act and the changes that this Bill will make to that Act. There are quite a few technical, but important, changes to the Ethics Act being brought forward here and I look forward to dealing with them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Perry raised the issue of gifts to office holders. The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, requires office holders to surrender a gift of over £500 in value given by virtue of their office. This surrender requirement does not apply, obviously, to personal gifts that, for example, might be received from a relative. The Secretary to the Government determines the value of the gifts if there is any doubt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring made a forceful and interesting contribution to the debate, including mentioning the Freedom of Information Act, for which I have responsibility. He did so in fairly negative terms. I understand some of the issues he raised, although they do not all arise from the Freedom of Information Act. I am reminded of the quote from a southern US politician, who apparently said:</P>
    <P>Never write what you can telephone,</P>
    <P>Never telephone what you can talk,</P>
    <P>Never talk what you can whisper,</P>
    <P>Never whisper what you can nod, and</P>
    <P>Never nod what you can wink.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> Deputy Ring's contribution to this debate proved that he is no whisperer but it would be unfortunate if a culture of secrecy pervaded the operations of the public sector. That is why many countries, including Ireland, have in recent years been taking steps to increase the transparency of their political and administrative systems.</P>
    <P>The House should be pleased with the fact that since the Government took office, and since I obtained responsibility for the legislation, the Freedom of Information Act has been extended to over 300 bodies. One should remember that the key purpose of that legislation is for the benefit of individual citizens. That benefit is now being reaped across the country by many of the people whom we represent collectively in the House.</P>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Act, 1997, is a key element in delivering the quality, transparency, openness and accountability required by a modern society. I accept it poses difficulties and leads to certain intrusions. One regrets at times the way the media deals with certain information which it is freely given regarding politicians. It was always my wish that the media would present the information in a proper context and not selectively use it to distort the facts regarding any Deputy or Senator. That is grossly unfair and it is a misuse of the Act. I have no difficulty making available information that comes under the remit of the Act even if at times it is personal. That does not bother me and I am quite prepared to make the information available, as are most Deputies and Senators. However, people in receipt of the information, which has been given honestly and freely, have a responsibility to ensure it is presented in a proper context.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies who have contributed to the debate. There was tremendous interest and the committees involved put in significant work. I will bring forward amendments which have arisen out of the deliberations of the joint committees and the Second Stage debate. I have no doubt Members will table their own amendments and I look forward very much to Committee Stage. I hope we will have a worthwhile Bill at the end of this process. I commend the legislation to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 15, line 18, before &ldquo;(1)&rdquo;, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Subject to <i>subsection (2)</i> of this section, this Act, to the extent that the provisions thereof do not involve a charge on public funds, shall come into operation one calendar month following its enactment.</P>
      <P>(2) <i>Part 3</i>, to the extent that the provisions thereof do not involve a charge on public funds, shall come into operation upon the enactment of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome Report Stage of this Bill. It has had a lengthy gestation. The legislation was published in its present format in 1999 and it has taken two years to reach Report Stage. It had a previous life as a Bill published by the previous Government some years earlier.</P>
      <P>The main provisions of the legislation will replace the Children Act, 1908, and attempt to put in place a modern structure dealing with juvenile justice. The Bill deals with a number of other areas of public concern and addresses children who suffer personal difficulties, are incapable of caring for themselves and are out of control to the degree that they cannot be cared for by their parents.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with the Bill is that there has not been any indication from the Government as to when it will be implemented. It has taken too long to be progressed through the House and has not been given the priority it deserves. We have been confronted by a section which prescribes that various sections of the legislation can come into operation on such days as may be designated by the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage we invited the Minister of State to outline a time frame within which the provisions in the legislation would be brought into force but she failed to do so. In the context of major legislation such as this, which will transform our criminal justice system and redress major gaps in the child care area that have been not merely ignored but exacerbated during the <Col N="28" /><Col N="29" /> lifetime of the Government and been exposed by the courts, the House should not enact the measure and leave it to the Government to determine when a particular section might come into force.</P>
    <P>As the Bill has had a lengthy gestation, it is reasonable to assume some preparatory steps have been taken within Government, in Departments and through consultation with health boards to allow the legislation to be enforced with some speed. It is reasonable to assume, if the Government is serious, some of the new statutory instruments or regulations which are needed to bring sections or Parts of the legislation into operation should be in draft form and ready to be laid before the House. It is also reasonable to assume that in this year's Estimates for the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform the necessary financial allocations have been made to facilitate the operation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>It should not be left to the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, Education and Science or the Minister of State with responsibility for children to decide whether the Bill should come into force in October 2001 or, perhaps by some electoral accident the same people happen to be in Government, in October 2002 or in a decade's time.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes a new section which would facilitate within one calendar month the laying before the House of whatever regulations may be required to allow certain Parts of the legislation to become operational. Part 3, which should come into operation on the day the President signs this measure, deals with children in need of special care or protection. It seeks to amend the Child Care Act, 1991, which would provide statutory provisions to deal with children who have particular difficulties and need a special type of care by way of a special care order. This relates to the hundreds of children in need of special care and attention secure facilities, and psychiatric or psychological services but who cannot be cared for in their own homes, on whose behalf court cases have had to be initiated on almost a daily basis during the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>Court cases have been brought by parents on behalf of their children, by health boards in some instances and by other individuals. In all these court cases the Department of Health and Children has been named as a defendant or respondent. Frequently, health boards have been named as defendants and respondents and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has also been named on occasions. The Departments are named as respondents or defendants in the proceedings through the legal personality of the individual Ministers. The Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are responsible for this Bill. Because of the Government's total failure to provide appropriate care facilities for children, these <Col N="30" /> Ministers are the most litigated among the Cabinet which forms this Government.</P>
    <P>Millions of pounds of taxpayers' money has been spent defending the indefensible in these court cases. We are told that in excess of £0.5 million has been spent in payments to counsel representing applicants in these proceedings. That is only in respect of cases which have progressed to the degree where cost orders have been made. Similar sums must have been paid to counsel acting for the State. Similar sums must be owing to solicitors and counsel acting for applicants bringing cases which have not yet been disposed of. Hours and days of Judiciary time have been taken up by these cases.</P>
    <P>We have seen exposed in the courts on a weekly basis the chaos administered over by the Minister for Health and Children in the context of providing places for children with special needs. Plans have been presented to the courts about the provision of new facilities which did not materialise, submissions have been made on behalf of the Government to the courts telling members of the Judiciary of the existence of social services which barely exist and promises have been made about ensuring that new facilities will be in place to meet needs within a certain timeframe which are not kept. The manner in which the Government has dealt with these children is a national scandal. Because the children do not have votes and because we are talking about a minority of children whose problems affect a minority of families, tragically their plight is not something which warrants the type of concerted media attention that forces responsible Government action. The inaction of Government is frequently covered up in a smokescreen of public relations.</P>
    <P>My concern relates not only to the entirety of the Act but to Part 3 in respect of which cases are daily litigated in our courts. The Government has not been prepared to give a commitment that Part 3 of this Bill will be brought into force immediately upon the Bill being enacted. I ask the Minister of State to give that commitment. If she will not give that commitment, I ask her in the context of the promises of Government action made in many cases to Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, who has done extraordinary work as a High Court judge in bearing the burden of the tragedies of the many children the Government has not properly provided for and in seeking to provide by judicial order measures to meet their needs, to indicate why Part 3 of the Bill cannot be brought into force automatically upon its enactment. I want the Minister of State to tell the House if all the necessary resources are in place to bring Part 3 into force. I want her to explain why we do not have a timeframe to bring into force the other provisions contained in this measure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall, who has tabled similar amendments, and I are in an identical position in the manner in which the rules of this House curtail us in the type of amendment we on the Opposition benches can frame. Like me, I have no <Col N="31" /> doubt Deputy Shortall &ndash; I hope she will not take umbrage if I take the liberty of speaking for her in this regard, although I know she can speak for herself, but I am sure we are <i>ad idem</i> on this issue &ndash; did not want the amendments tabled, which we are now discussing together, to have any proviso attached to them. Neither of us had any wish to say either the entirety of the Bill or particular sections of it should be brought into force either immediately or in a month's time but subject to the proviso that bringing them into force would not result in any additional Government expenditure. That proposal is nonsense.</P>
    <P>While there are aspects of the Bill which can be brought into force which will not incur Government expenditure, there are others, such as the provision of some of the essential services under Part 3, which would incur Government expenditure. However, the Opposition benches have been advised to table it that way because we cannot amend a Bill in any way which might impose an additional charge on the Exchequer. The difficulty each of us has is that we have not been given an assurance by the Government to date that all the moneys which needed to be allocated to the various Departments this year to bring this Bill fully into force have been allocated. If our amendments were tabled in any different shape or form, there was a risk they would have been ruled out of order and we would not have been able to raise the issue of the timeframe for bringing this legislation into operation.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to tell us that whatever moneys are needed have been voted, proposed and accepted by the Government and that the sections, whether it is Part 3, which deals with children who need special care or protection, or the other Parts of the Bill, can be brought into force. Part 3 should be brought into force immediately and the remainder should be brought into force within one month of the Bill's enactment. The only reason for the one month provision is to provide a short timeframe within which necessary regulations can be laid before this House and can become law. That additional provision is necessary in respect of the different Parts of the Bill. We will deal with the specific substance of the Bill's provisions at length during the day.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on the need for this House to lay down a specific timeframe for the bringing into force of this legislation and the obligation on the Minister to put on the record of this House a timeframe to which the Government is prepared to commit itself. I am speaking from the knowledge of how a Fianna Fáil-led Government previously dealt with child care issues. The Child Care Act, 1991, which was also passed after a lengthy gestation period and enacted in this House in 1991, was put in place after substantial lobbying and much difficulty and controversy. I remember the day the Bill went through the Seanad and the President signed it, the then Minister for Health in a great fanfare of public <Col N="32" /> relations publicity ensured that self-congratulatory statements were issued to record the tremendous work which the then Minister had done in processing this legislation through the House. A call was made on the public to recognise that we had entered a new era in the area of child care. The problem was that it was not until October 1995 that most of the provisions in the Child Care Act were brought into force. That was after Fianna Fáil was thrown out of Government and Fine Gael came back into Government. It was not until 1995 that the new range of measures in the legislation required to protect children at risk had an impact on anybody.</P>
    <P>The tragic reality is, that having failed our children for decades, we continued to fail children at risk after 1991 by not putting in place the protective legislative measures necessary to cater for the diversity of problems and difficulties they suffer. Some of the children, on whose behalf claims will be made for compensation under the new Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001, were being sexually and physically abused in the early 1990s. They have been failed by social services and the Government because legislation enacted in this House was effectively left to gather dust on a departmental shelf. There was no concept of the need to prioritise bringing before this House the regulations necessary to render it operative.</P>
    <P>This Bill must not sit on a Department shelf for four years after enactment by this House. It must be rapidly brought into force by ensuring that all necessary resources are properly in place and the preparations needed to make the regulations are fully and properly undertaken within a time frame controlled by this House as the legislature.</P>
    <P>This Bill must go from the Dáil to Seanad. It is a tradition that this House does not discuss the business of the Seanad but I invite the Minister to indicate whether the Government will allocate sufficient time to this Bill to ensure its enactment in the Seanad before the summer recess. I urge him to ensure that this happens. If the Seanad must sit late into July to complete that task, so be it.</P>
    <P>We have failed &ndash; and continue to fail &ndash; to address urgent problems relating to children. Children have been left in a vulnerable position because our court system and legal remedies are antiquated and we lack the special schools and facilities necessary to deal with children experiencing difficulties. It is a disgrace that our criminal law relating to children continues to operate under an Act passed almost a century ago by the Westminster Parliament and largely replaced and repealed in 1926.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendments Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, in particular I support amendments Nos. 2 and 3 in my name. These amendments concern the commencement date for this Bill. The reason I, and presumably Deputy Shatter, have put down these amendments is that we have no confidence that this Government is serious <Col N="33" /> about dealing with juvenile crime. The record stands as an indictment of the Government.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the Minister inherited a Bill that had already passed Second Stage in this House. He chose to sit on it for several years before finally producing it in an amended form last year. We then had to wait several months to debate it. Time and again the Bill was put on the long finger. It was taken on Committee Stage only after a great deal of pressure had been applied to both the Taoiseach and the Minister concerned. This side of the House does not believe there is a sense of urgency on the part of either the Government or the officials of the three Departments concerned.</P>
      <P>The record over many years and during many Governments shows that issues relating to children, particularly children on the margins, are not given political priority. As Deputy Shatter said, juvenile justice is still governed by legislation dating from 1908. It is difficult to understand why this area receives so little political attention. Clearly most of the affected children are on the margins and do not have political clout having no right to vote because of their age. Most children who come into contact with the law are poor and many politicians assume that because the poor are not generally the voting public, they can afford to ignore them. It is not until later in life, when the same children have become criminals filling our prisons at enormous cost to the State, that the issue of justice receives high profile attention in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or elsewhere at political level.</P>
      <P>Our prisons are bulging. People are incarcerated at a cost of £70,000 to £100,000 a year, which is an enormous waste of human potential. Most of the problems manifesting themselves in our prisons could have been dealt with when the prisoners were aged eight, nine, ten or 11 and the problems were first presenting. There was no service in place to deal with them. These children grew up neglected by the State and it was only a matter of time before they ended up behind bars in the State's care.</P>
      <P>I deeply regret that the principle of prevention has not yet been accepted by Departments and, specifically, their senior officials. The tendency over many years has been to consider problems as serious only when they have manifested themselves in adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has frequently spoken about this Bill, having launched it and its various sections umpteen times in the media as if they constituted new ideas that he has suddenly come up with. The incredible media machine this Government operates has succeeded in putting across the idea that it is serious about what it is doing. In spite of all the launches, reports and press statements, we are in a position in 2001 of having massive budget surpluses while our child welfare and protection services are in a shambles. The reason I can describe our child protection services as a shambles is that I deal with problems in my constituency almost on a daily basis. People through<Col N="34" /> out the country contact me on this matter. I will give a few examples of the shambles and chaos that exist in case people are not aware of them.</P>
    <P>This morning, for example, I was contacted about a 13 year old girl who has been in the care of a health board since four years ago when a court issued a lengthy care order for the child to be kept in the care of the health board until she was 18 years of age. A care order of that duration is serious. The child was being housed in a health board facility. It seems no one paid attention to the fact that a 13 year old needs very close supervision and care and eventually the child came and went as she pleased and was left to her own devices.</P>
    <P>She was taken out by a male relative who sexually abused her on a number of occasions. He also sexually abused a number of other young girls. A case will come before the courts shortly. The 13 year old concerned was not only seriously physically and sexually abused by that person, she was also abused by her alcoholic mother. Because of the seriousness of the case, she was placed in the care of the health board. Recently it decided to release her, having found her too difficult to contain in a health board facility. She has been released on to the streets with the requirement that she reports to her local Garda station by eight o'clock every evening. If she reports to the Garda, they will contact a duty social worker who will try to make arrangements to find a hostel bed for her for the night. That is the state of our care services. A 13 year old child is being left to her own devices, having been sexually abused, left on the street with no question of any educational or care services being put in place. Somebody who is highly vulnerable and very much a child at 13 years of age is being left entirely to her own devices. The State has abnegated all responsibility for that child and the only promise is the prospect of a hospital bed if she reports to a Garda station. That is a care system that is in absolute chaos.</P>
    <P>That is one particular case. That is a child who has come before the courts where a care order has been issued. There is also a situation within the Northern Area Health Board which serves the north city and county of Dublin. Before any cases can be taken to court, a child must be allocated a social worker. Many complaints are made to the social work services where there is a suspicion of sexual or physical abuse or serious neglect. These complaints would be made by a school principal or teacher, for example, a neighbour who is aware of something going on at home that is worrying or a complaint from a relative. Complaints are made to the local health board and children now go on a waiting list for a social worker. On the north side of Dublin there are 686 children waiting to be allocated a social worker. I ask the Minister to ponder on what this actually means. In one part of the country, the north side of Dublin, there are 686 children, about whom there are suspicions of sexual or physical abuse or serious neglect, on waiting lists for a social <Col N="35" /> worker. Of these, we are told that 200 are priority cases. There are, therefore, 200 cases where it has been established that there is abuse or neglect and the service still cannot meet the needs of those children. These are the most highly vulnerable at-risk children that one can imagine. They are children who are in situations of abuse and danger and the care services are not in a position to intervene to protect them. That is the reality of Ireland's booming Celtic tiger economy of 2001 where the children of the poor are being left to fend for themselves and it seems that nobody gives a damn.</P>
    <P>On the question of the detention services operated by the Department of Education and Science, the position is not much better. Only recently, the case of a 12 year old boy was brought to my attention. He had been in trouble with the law over a number of years. It was the usual case. A dysfunctional family, the child had left home when he was eight or nine years of age, was living on the streets, got into trouble with the law and finally, when he was 12 years of age, he was sentenced to 12 months detention. The case took a long time in the Children's Court. He was finally given a 12 months sentence. As we are aware, it is a matter of last resort that a child is given a custodial sentence, to be served in Oberstown. The Garda duly collected the child from the Children's Court, drove him out to Oberstown, knocked on the door and was told by the director that there was no room for him. The Garda drove the child to an address in my constituency and delivered him home. That was the end of that. That, again, is our shambles of a care system. A child who engaged in activities sufficiently serious to bring him before the courts and impose a lengthy sentence, in the context of a child, simply because no place was available is just left to his own devices on the street. I would be prepared to bet a penny to a pound that it is only a matter of time before he ends up in St. Patrick's Institution and then in the care of the State in Mountjoy Prison. It is only a matter of time until he reaches the age of 18 years when he will qualify.</P>
    <P>On the basis of first-hand, practical experience, the Government has clearly displayed that it does not care about the needs of the most vulnerable children, the children of the poor who come in contact with the law, whose parents will not vote, write letters to <i>The Irish Times</i>, turn up at politicians' clinics or be in a position to have parliamentary questions tabled. Those forgotten people, the emerging underclass that we have allowed to develop, will be consigned to the underclass unless there is some kind of political seriousness about tackling the problem. The kind of scatter-gun approach which is a hallmark of the Government, where it spends money where there are likely to be votes, does nothing to help these forgotten children.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that, in spite of all the fanfare about the production of the Bill &ndash; no doubt <Col N="36" /> that when it completes all Stages the Minister will issue a number of other press releases &ndash; I am not prepared to continue with the charade of pretending that action has been taken or changes made when, in all probability, this legislation will sit on the shelf for several years until such time as there is political will, if it ever happens, to implement it.</P>
    <P>The other aspect which gives a clear indication that the Government is not serious about implementing this legislation in the near future is that little or no preparation has been made to put in place the type of resources, particularly staff resources, required. Since 1995, when the &ldquo;FN&rdquo; case was heard and the State given a clear responsibility for providing for the needs of children, we are aware that there have been serious shortages of social workers. This is ludicrous. Leaving certificate students are queuing up to get into university to undergo social work training, yet the number of social work places in universities is minute compared to the need that exists.</P>
    <P>There are 700 children waiting for social workers on the north side of Dublin. The position is equally bad in other parts of Dublin and, no doubt, throughout the country. I asked the Minister of State recently the number of children on waiting lists for social workers, but she was unable to provide the answer. As the data are not collected in the Department, three or four weeks later I am still waiting for the information. If the Minister does not know the scale of the problem, how can he possibly pretend to be dealing with it?</P>
    <P>There is a huge shortage of social workers and no serious attempt is being made to increase the intake into universities in order to meet the existing demand before the implementation of the Children Bill. Given the huge shortages in staff provision, even if there was political will, there is no chance that this legislation can be implemented in the foreseeable future. It then becomes a vicious circle because where there is understaffing within difficult services &ndash; there is no doubt that providing social work services for at-risk children is a very difficult job &ndash; the burden is all the heavier for those in the jobs. The burnout rate and the turnover of staff is very high. The more difficult and needy the areas, the less likely they are to have adequate staff because staff move on, very often to the private sector where the job is much easier and where they are better paid. They leave behind a trail of personal and human destruction, with long and growing waiting lists for essential social work services to protect the most vulnerable children. Nothing has been done in recent times to ensure there is an adequate supply of social workers for the current need and the increased need that will arise from the implementation of the Children Bill.</P>
    <P>The other important aspect in relation to staff is the probation and welfare service which is seriously understaffed. On Committee Stage the Minister stated that attempts to recruit the staff complement which had been agreed were unsuc<Col N="37" /> cessful as the people were not available. These people will come from the same pool as social workers. The staff are not available to meet existing needs.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I asked the Minister what the projected Probation and Welfare Service need would be in the context of the full implementation of this Bill. He stated that an additional 90 probation and welfare officers would be needed. He was not able to recruit the complement for last year and he has no chance of recruiting the additional staff. There has been no forward thinking on the part of the Minister or his officials to enable them to meet the staff demands which will arise as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that, on Committee Stage, I asked him if he had held discussions with the Minister for Education and Science or the Higher Education Authority to ensure that the intake into universities would match the demands which would arise as a result of this legislation. At that time the Minister stated that he had not held such discussions. Has he made any effort to ensure there will be a sufficient number of people in training to meet the demand which will arise from this legislation? If he has not done so, he will confirm my belief that this is an area which receives little or no political priority, which has been seriously neglected over many years and which the Minister continues to neglect by his inactivity.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the litany of problems and crises which I come across, almost on a daily basis, in my constituency. These crises which affect vulnerable children are coming before the courts at least twice a week and the three Ministers were threatened with being held in contempt of court because of their inaction in this area. Vast amounts of money are being spent defending these cases. The Department has spent £500,000, yet that is a pittance compared with what health boards are spending going to court and making indefensible cases in which they try to claim that the needs of vulnerable children are not their responsibility. I am referring to a situation in which, for example, a health board decides it is acceptable that a 13 year old child is left on the streets to her own devices. This is the kind of mentality whereby a health board thinks it is acceptable to leave children on their own without accommodation or care. Those same people are going to court and defending their right not to accept responsibility for children who come to the attention of the courts. In recent years in the ERHA area, between £6 million and £7 million has been spent defending these cases. It seems extraordinary that at a time when there are such shortages of resources for the child protection services, we are squandering that amount of money defending the indefensible.</P>
    <P>In light of this, it is essential that we put in place a mechanism to ensure that this area is taken seriously and that the legislation on which we have worked for a long time is implemented in a short time scale. However, we cannot have <Col N="38" /> any confidence in the Minister or the media to ensure that happens. Deputy Shatter, the Ministers and I spent six or seven long and arduous sessions on Committee Stage going through the detail of the Bill. To the best of my knowledge not one reporter attended any of those sessions. This work represented more than 20 hours of detailed consideration of the legislation yet, again to the best of my knowledge, not a single line appeared in any newspaper or on any radio or television station regarding this important area.</P>
    <P>The Minister takes the view that this is a vast area which he can afford to ignore at a political level as there are no votes in it and he will not be damaged electorally. He is bolstered in that view of politics, and of the Government's responsibility, by the media which has shown little or no interest in this issue.</P>
    <P>One must ask questions about the role of the media and the criteria it uses to select the political issues to be covered. Many newspapers and radio stations are driven by market concerns where advertising is a major element of their operations. By and large those who are inclined to advertise in the broadsheets are not the kind of people who would be remotely interested in the needs of abandoned and abused children in Ballymun, north Clondalkin, Tallaght or Darndale. There is an absence of any sense of responsibility on the part of many journalists to look at this as a serious political issue, or as an important issue of justice, equity, neglect and of who should care for the poor. Not many journalists have taken the time to acquaint themselves with the issues or to apprise themselves of the scandal which has existed for many years, and which continues to exist, in the child welfare and protection services.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago the media was interested when the Taoiseach issued an apology to those who were abused and neglected by people charged with caring for them while they were in the care of the State in residential institutions. Most people shared that sense of regret and deep apology. However, this abuse was not confined to the past &ndash; it continues to happen. Hundreds of children are in dangerous situations and are being abused and seriously neglected and this State, with all the money at its disposal, is not in a position, or is not prepared, to provide care and protection for them. As I said to the Taoiseach yesterday, I have no doubt that in ten years time there will be another &ldquo;States of Fear&rdquo; programme and another inquiry into the situation which exists in 2001 where hundreds of children are not being provided with the care and protection they require. This State has chosen to avert its gaze and to put money into sexy pet projects which the public likes and in which the media is interested. Meanwhile, the children of the poor who are most at risk and who are being abused, continue to be abused at an official level by the State and by the media whose role it should be to highlight inequality and injustice.</P>
    <P>I am sure the media will pick up on the Mini<Col N="39" /> ster's press releases when the Bill is passed. However, I invite those members of the media who are interested in political issues, in political responsibility for the way in which we run society and in ensuring justice for all, to take the trouble to look behind the Minister's press releases and see what things are like in the real world and the neglect and abuse which continues.</P>
    <P>I have no confidence or optimism that this matter will be treated seriously. There is no sense that the Minister will take this Bill and get it through quickly, to ensure it is implemented at an early stage to protect children who depend on him for protection. I would be prepared to bet money that this legislation will lie dormant for years until there is another scandal or inquiry and then we will start to consider implementing sections of it. I do not believe the Minister is serious about implementation. It is necessary to set implementation dates for the Bill. As Deputy Shatter stated, Opposition Members are not in a position to propose any action on a Bill if it involves a charge on the Exchequer. For that reason, we can only include the proviso that the provisions of this Act which do not involve a potential charge on public funds shall be brought into operation immediately. I am concerned about the aspects of this Bill which will require considerable resources&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that and just wish to make a final point. Due to the fact that a number of the Bill's provisions require urgent implementation, amendment No. 3 proposes that the Minister, be it the current Minister or any future Minister, regardless of his or her political persuasion, shall report to both Houses of the Oireachtas at six monthly intervals on progress made in bringing the Bill's provisions into operation. Given our hopeless record in this area, I am not confident that this or any other Minister will take this matter seriously nor am I confident that the media will pursue the Minister of the day to ensure he or she does the job properly. For that reason, I intend to press amendment No. 3.</P>

      <P>In 1996, as an Opposition Member, I made it very clear that I was not satisfied with the provisions of that year's Children Bill. I also made it clear that substantial amendment would be required if the Bill were to be effective and reflect modern Irish society. I make no apologies for having ensured that the legislation as it then stood was carefully studied in my Department when the Government came into office. It was our view that the legislation would not meet modern requirements and, in those cir<Col N="40" /> cumstances, consideration was given to amending the legislation. It was subsequently found that the amendments required would be so numerous that it would be preferable to produce new legislation. That is not for a moment to deny the work carried out by former Minister of State, Deputy Currie. We merely sought to improve the legislation to meet modern requirements.</P>

      <P>Previous legislation in this area was almost 100 years old and since the legislation I sought to introduce would, in all probability, survive for many decades, I felt it should be a model of international best practice. In that context, former Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, was sent to New Zealand to consider the situation there and to see whether we could adopt some of its legislative provisions in this area which have proven successful. We also considered the position in other countries and, having done so, produced what I regard as an innovative, imaginative and forward looking Children Bill which will stand the test of time.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and we in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and people in the other relevant Departments have been in a position to proceed with the legislation for some time. However, time was not made available to debate the legislation and we can hardly be faulted for that. The legislation currently before the House is a model of best practice and I am confident it will be effective and prove inspirational in the coming years.</P>
      <P>All of the amendments before the House are variations on a theme &ndash; the commencement of the many and varied provisions of the Bill, responsibility for which will be a matter for three Ministers &ndash; which was fully explored and discussed on Committee Stage. Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are totally new and the first of them would, if accepted, cause nothing but confusion about what will or will not come into operation on the signing of this legislation. This type of amendment would be bad enough in a short Bill but in a Bill comprising 273 sections and two schedules, it would be nothing short of disastrous. The amendment has little, if any, regard for reality. How would the Garda, the health boards, education officials, the courts and members of the public know what would be in operation on day one? Complete confusion would reign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an integrated Bill such as this, there may be sections which would not pose any potential charge on public funds but which would be dependent on sections which would involve such a potential charge. What, in the circumstances, is meant by &ldquo;potential charge&rdquo; and who would <Col N="41" /> decide what it means? In practical terms, the cost of implementing the provisions of the Bill will become clearer in time. What would happen if a section were to automatically come into operation simply because someone decided it did not involve a potential charge but if it were later to emerge that a charge was involved? We would then be faced with the ridiculous situation where a Minister would make an order bringing into operation a provision already fully operational for some time. Assuming that matters would not be as obvious as I suspect they would be, lawyers would clearly have a field day.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3, if accepted, would cause confusion and present us with many practical difficulties. It is also totally unnecessary as the information sought would be available through other means such as parliamentary questions. Therefore, I suspect the real purpose of this amendment is not simply to gain information. I referred to confusion and practical difficulties. The amendment refers to &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; which is defined as &ldquo;the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rdquo;. However, large chunks of this Bill are the responsibility of the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science and it would not be appropriate for one Minister to continually report to the Houses under statutory obligation on the statutory obligations of other Ministers. The wording of the amendment would result in the Minister reporting on the progress of the implementation process to both Houses of the Oireachtas for an indefinite period.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 6 in the name of Deputy Shatter was fully debated on Committee Stage. Amendment No. 1 which involves the imposition of a definite time scale on the Bill's implementation is of a similar nature. These amendments confuse the legislative process with the administrative provisions required to be in place before the Act or any part, section or provision thereof comes into operation. Asking a Minister to accept amendments such as these is tantamount to asking him or her to accept responsibility for the unknown or for matters which, in certain circumstances, are outside his or her control. I will illustrate that point in a moment but I want to first place on record the actions already taken to ensure the Bill's speedy implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda community relations section has operated pilot schemes on restorative conferencing and cautioning for more than a year. Approximately 30 such conferences have been held and I am delighted the reports I have received are very encouraging. To date, most juvenile liaison officers have been trained in mediation and other relevant skills by the Mediation Council of Ireland and a company called Real Justice. With regard to the family conference to be convened by the probation and welfare service, experts <Col N="42" /> came to Ireland last September from New Zealand to train probation officers in family conferencing. Planning has also been carried out on implementing the provision of places of detention for 16 and 17 year old detainees, separate from older detainees. On 16 January 2001, I formally announced the commencement of a major programme of redevelopment at Cork prison. The project, which will take three years to complete at a cost in excess of £35 million, will include a separate facility for 16 and 17 year old detainees in a 40 place unit with full support facilities. Detailed planning and preliminary site work is at an advanced stage and building work is expected to commence later this year on the main buildings in the complex. Sites are also currently being examined in the Dublin region for a further 110 such places, comprising separate secure detention facilities for up to 20 females and 90 males.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill provides for a Special Residential Services Board which is already operating with a full membership on an administrative basis pending the enactment of the legislation. Plans have been prepared by the Department of Education and Science for a capital development programme for children detention schools. The sum of £9 million has been allocated this year to implement the programme while priority has been given to the provision in Lusk of a specialised highly secure unit to cater for the depraved and unruly children who would previously have gone to prison as well as for those with particular special needs. Section 101 provides for day assessment of children found guilty of offences as an alternative to the preparation of a report while the child is in custody. Plans for the provision of such at an existing probation office have encountered planning difficulties over a change of use of the office. The unavoidable consequence has been a delay of well over 12 months, but I am glad to say that the place is open for referrals from the courts for the preparation of probation officer reports. The problem with planning illustrates how delays can occur which makes acceptance of an amendment such as this impossible. It is clear that much has been done and is being done to ensure the speedy and co-ordinated implementation of the Bill. Many provisions will come into operation when the Bill is enacted and shortly afterwards, but it must be faced that some parts will require substantial capital expenditure or the employment of additional staff. With planning and other delays and the difficulty of attracting staff of a high calibre, it is difficult to predict precise implementation dates for some parts of the Bill. Regrettably, this makes acceptance of the amendments impossible.</P>
    <P>I now turn to amendments Nos. 4 and 5 which refer to implementing Parts 2 and 3 of the Bill which are primarily concerned with putting the family welfare conference on a statutory footing and imposing certain duties on health boards concerning children in need of special care and protection. As I pointed out on Committee Stage, the two Parts are inextricably linked to each other <Col N="43" /> and with Part 11 which establishes the Special Residential Services Board. Under the Bill, where it appears to a health board that a child in its area is in need of special care and protection a family welfare conference must be convened under Part 2 before the board can apply for a special care order under Part 3. It will also have to seek the views of the Special Residential Services Board if the board still proposes to apply for a special care order after the conference has completed its deliberations. It will, therefore, not be possible to bring into operation Part 3 without also bringing into operation Parts 2 and 11. The Government has made a major investment in the development of child welfare services for vulnerable children and their families and for children at risk, including the development of services in anticipation of the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This year the Government allocated a further £33 million in revenue for the further development of these services. In the letters of net determination issued by the Department of Health and Children health boards are instructed to introduce the family welfare conference on a phased basis in order that they will be in a position to meet their obligations under Part 2. The Department has also approved the development of an additional 110 high support special care places to enable Part 3 of the Bill to be introduced. Approximately half of these places already exist and include the purpose-built care unit at Ballydowd. Over the next 12 months it is anticipated that most of the rest will come on stream bringing the total number of places to 160. Significant progress has been made by health boards in meeting these targets despite the many difficulties such as objections to planning permission, difficulties in recruiting staff due to the economic climate and opposition from local communities.</P>
    <P>The Government was responsible for establishing the springboard initiative establishing family support projects to work intensively with children, mainly in the seven to 12 year age group, who are at risk of going into care or getting into trouble with the law.</P>

      <P>In addition, a joint working group from the Department of Health and Children and the health boards has been established to identify the gaps in the services for children in need of special care and protection with a view to submitting recommendations soon. A great deal of progress has been made. However, to allow for the planned development and strengthening of the services it is necessary to allow for the phased introduction of parts of the Bill. As I pointed out on Committee Stage, the implementation of these parts is considered a priority by the Government and it is the intention to implement them before the end of the year. The £33 million which has been allocated includes money for the ongoing development of high sup<Col N="44" /> port special care units, the phased introduction of family welfare conferences, the development of youth homeless services and the further development of family support services, particularly the springboard initiative in Raphoe, Darndale and Loughlinstown. All these will strengthen the services necessary for implementation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>During the course of her contribution, Deputy Shortall referred to the lack of personnel in the probation and welfare service and child care services. It is a sad fact of life that there is difficulty in recruiting the necessary staff.</P>

All the available evidence, in terms of the resources which have been brought forward to deal with the problem, indicates the contrary.

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is noteworthy that at the start of his comments the Minister engaged in what could best be described as a somewhat tortured, politically partisan semantic analysis of the amendments. The Minister managed the unique <Col N="46" /> feat of talking for some time without putting on the record when precisely it is anticipated particular Parts of the Bill will be brought into force. That is a direct question, simply put, to which the Minister has failed to respond. This Bill has 13 Parts and 273 sections. The Minister has managed to not tell the House when a single Part or section will be brought into force. He has expressed a vague aspiration that some bits of the Bill might, by the end of the year, be brought into force.</P>
      <P>In the context of the amendments as tabled, the Minister well knows the reason for the phraseology of the first two amendments, which was set out clearly by me when I started speaking. If it is not possible to get the Government to agree to commence Part III instantly and the remaining Parts within one month, will the Minister explain why the Government has any difficulty in not placing before the House, one month after the enactment of this measure, a timetable detailing when it proposes to bring different provisions of the Act into operation? Why is it not willing subsequently to use further timetables on an amended basis if it cannot fulfil the original timetable? That is what amendment No. 6 deals with and the Minister has not dealt with the substance of that. The House has a role in ensuring that legislation which passes through it becomes operative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty, as Deputy Shatter well knows, is that there are built-in time limits to the legislation. It would not be feasible or practical and I have explained in great detail why it would not be feasible or practical to do what the Deputy says. He understands  precisely why I cannot do what he says. He also knows the Government has approved my approaching this legislation in the best of good faith and that it is not being put on the Statute Book for the fun of it. He is unwilling to accept my explanations for reasons best known to himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Sadly, the Minister did not avail of the opportunity to respond to me. I find it quite extraordinary that a measure designed to bring our laws on children into the 21st century and to effectively sweep the cobwebs of the 19th century off the Statute Book has been before the House for two years and the debate on it is concluding today, yet the Minister is not able to put on the record a commitment that any particular section in the Bill will become operational within an identified time frame or by a particular date. That is treating the House with contempt and is trying to create a charade that legislation is in place to revolutionise the law on children and services which the Government has no intention of bringing into operation this side of the next general election. That is the stark reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the preparations the Minister outlined and the preliminary work done, if that work is at the advanced stage the Minister alleges, it should be within his competence to <Col N="47" /> make a commitment to the House regarding at least some aspects of the legislation. I am particularly appalled at the cavalier manner in which the Minister dealt with the proposal in Part III, which should come into force immediately. How many more cases have to be brought before Mr. Justice Peter Kelly on behalf of children with special difficulties, for the Government to recognise the need to enact new legislation and to put in place a statutory framework to address the problems of these children? How many more times will officials from the relevant Departments, Health and Children or Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have to be called to give evidence before courts to explain the gross neglect by the Government in this area? How many more children will die because of the Government's failure to provide the secure residential establishments with professional back-up services needed to meet the special problems of the children whose cases are daily dealt with in the High Court? How many more High Court investigations are to take place into Government failure?</P>
    <P>I predict that within the next five to six years we will have yet another tribunal examining issues relating to the State's failure to care properly for children. The Ministers who have had responsibility for children in this Government &ndash; in the Departments of Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform as well as Health and Children &ndash; and the two Ministers of State appointed with titles as Ministers with responsibility for children will be called to give evidence before that tribunal. Before that happens the State will have to answer to the European Court of Human Rights for its failure to protect children and to afford to them the protections that court has held they are entitled to under the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. I take no satisfaction in saying this. I do not want to see the State hauled before the European Court for its failings but it is inevitable that will happen. I do not want hundreds of thousands of pounds wasted on legal costs because of the necessity of bringing the plight of children in difficulty to the High Court when such money could be properly spent on providing the facilities needed to care properly for those children and bringing into force the provisions in this measure.</P>
    <P>The Government has no sense of priority about this issue. The next time a tragedy affects a young child who has not been catered for by the State the tabloid media will feature it on their front pages and there will be shock and horror among the non-tabloid newspapers, which will have editorials written on it. Not too much will be written about the fact that during today's deliberations here it has been pointed out that although the Bill passes today, it will not become operative and probably will not do so, on this Government's plans, for a number of years. The only hope of bringing this measure into operation <Col N="48" /> within a reasonable time frame is based on the real possibility that Fianna Fáil will be thrown out of Government after the next election and that the Opposition parties will receive sufficient electoral support to take over the reins of power and to implement this measure as a priority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met Prime Minister Persson on 30 May during his tour of European capitals in preparation for the Gothenburg European Council on 15 and 16 June. We discussed the major items likely to be on the agenda at Gothenburg. These have now been confirmed by the Presidency as enlargement of the EU, sustainable development, social and economic issues, including the broad economic policy guidelines, transatlantic relations and foreign policy issues, including the circumstances in the Middle East and the Balkans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On enlargement, we noted that agreement had <Col N="49" /> recently been reached on the free movement of persons, which will help advance the process. We discussed the possibility of moving towards setting accession dates for the candidate countries. We also discussed the ongoing debate on the future of Europe, which will be raised alongside enlargement, noting the importance of focusing on the substance of the Union and not just its institutions.</P>
    <P>We discussed the proposed EU strategy on sustainable development and agreed that the environmental dimension should be reflected in the Lisbon process. Social and economic issues discussed included broad economic policy guidelines, the single European sky and the Community patent.</P>
    <P>We noted that the Council meeting will be preceded by a dinner attended by President Bush and the 15 heads of state and government, and it is likely that developments in the Middle East and the western Balkans will be addressed.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the referendum on the Nice treaty has been a major disappointment to our European partners and I will brief my colleagues on this matter.</P>
    <P>At the EU summit in Gothenburg, I plan to meet the Prime Minister Mr. Blair to discuss the ongoing effort to implement the Good Friday Agreement. I also plan to meet the Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Buzek, to discuss economic issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach may recall that during Question Time on 8 May 2001, I proposed that he should initiate a broad debate on the future of Europe. Does he believe the outcome of the referendum on the Nice treaty would have been different had such a debate begun at that time? Is the forum to which the Taoiseach referred last night to be the forum for such a debate on the future of Europe and not simply a debate confined to considerations of the Nice treaty? If so, what time scale and <i>modus operandi</i> does he have in mind? When does the Taoiseach feel the Nice treaty will be put before the people again and when will a debate take place on the wider European issues that will arise at the Intergovernmental Conference in 2004?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to a debate on European issues, the Presidency has reported on the progress of the debate. Very few contributions have been made. We are one of the first countries to have set down some of the guidelines, but there has been no discussion on the range, agenda, format, etc. They are unlikely to be discussed until the European Council meeting at Lachen on the 14 and 15 December. It will set the agenda for progress in 2002, which will be reported to the European Council probably in the summer of 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last November, a number of countries, including Ireland, drew attention to relevant issues that should be discussed. In this regard, the Minister for Foreign Affairs made a number of speeches, as did I. As part of that debate, it had been con<Col N="50" /> sidered that there should be a wider consultation for the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference, which is regarded as a broader Intergovernmental Conference than those of either Nice or Amsterdam. As I said to Deputy Howlin when he raised the proposals of his party on how best to engage in a debate on Europe, my intention was to have the Nice treaty ratified and then move immediately to the debate on the future of Europe. However, because some of the issues involved are inter-related, it makes sense to deal with both the issues of the Nice treaty and the future of Europe side by side. Having done this, we can have an influence on the discussions in Lachen and those of 2002.</P>
    <P>Where Deputy Noonan's third question is concerned, I want to move quickly on the debates on the future of Europe and the Treaty of Nice. We must reach an agreement both inside and outside the House and examine all the options available to us.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we should return immediately to deal with the issue of the Nice Treaty because that would be the wrong route to take. We must reflect on, appreciate and understand the will of the people who, after all, voted against the treaty. At the same time, however, we are obliged to deal with enlargement. Even Deputy Gormley stated yesterday that he does not want to see the enlargement process stopped. That issue, therefore, must be dealt with before the end of next year and a considerable amount of difficult work will need to be done. We will have to reflect on this and consider how the issue should be handled. I do not believe we should rule anything out at this stage, we should consider all options.</P>
    <P>I have spoken with various senior officials and been in contact with the European Commission. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has been in contact with representatives of the applicant countries, both on a one-to-one basis and collectively, at the General Affairs Council. Over the three days &ndash; Thursday, Friday and Saturday &ndash; of the impending summit I will make it my business to speak with the leaders of the applicant countries. I wanted to have the referendum on the Nice Treaty passed at this stage in order to assist the progression of matters over the next three days, particularly in view of the fact that the leaders of the applicant countries had not intended to meet for a further year and were not meant to be involved in the Lachen discussions. The next discussions in which they were due to be involved are those which will take place this time next year. I must consult them and the Commission, establish the proposed forum here and move forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As stated yesterday, I am open to suggestion on the forum's terms of reference. I suggested, following an original suggestion from the Labour Party, that we should consider the models of the New Ireland Forum and the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and use them as a basis on which to proceed. Both models worked well, but per<Col N="51" /> haps some changes could be introduced to ensure the scope of the new forum is wide-ranging.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan's final question related to the benefit of the forum, on which, I accept, everyone cannot serve. The value of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation was that all groups with an input to make &ndash; whether it was in respect of education, equality or community issues &ndash; on Northern Ireland were able to make presentations to it. The discussions and question and answer sessions which took place on Friday mornings proved very useful. If we could do the same in terms of discussing European issues, perhaps the misunderstandings, confusion and other matters can be dealt with in a more open way.</P>

      <P>Yes, we will be establishing a forum and will get it into operation as soon as possible. I will discuss its terms of reference with the Opposition.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that his Ministers will not take up positions in advance of the forum's discussions which, in effect, would prejudice those discussions? He may be aware of comments by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, to the effect that the reason for the outcome of the referendum was that the Irish people were opposed to any further European integration. She proceeded to say that she also held this view. What is the point in establishing an all-party forum and inviting the various interest groups to participate in order to develop, in so far as is possible, a consensus policy on the future of Europe if Ministers are determined to make pre-emptive strikes before anyone reaches the negotiating table?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was present for almost the entire debate yesterday and various suggestions and reasons were put forward from all sides regarding the reason there had been a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote. The Minister, Deputy de Valera, stated that she did not want to see the emergence of a united states of Europe. I do not believe that is inconsistent with what Members on other sides of the House stated, not only yesterday, but on several <Col N="52" /> other occasions. The intention is that if we establish a forum similar to the previous forums, political parties in this House will be represented on it. People must have their input, not only to the debate on the Nice Treaty &ndash; the ratification process in respect of which will continue &ndash; but also to the debate on the future of Europe. As stated previously, both in the House and in reply to Deputy Noonan, the Intergovernmental Conference which will take place in 2004 will involve debate on a number of fundamental issues.</P>
      <P>It is important that parties and individuals in this country express their views on these matters in order that we can try to build a consensus. However, I do not believe that anyone will be prevented &ndash; within the forum, within their parties' political structures or within the Government &ndash; from expressing their views. As I understand it, everybody wants to build a consensus. Apart from the political points made in yesterday's debate, to which I listened carefully, everyone who contributed indicated that they were in favour of enlargement, which is what the Nice Treaty is about. However, there are other areas where people have concerns which are either related or perceived to be related to it and it is these we must address.</P>

I understand one of the early items on the agenda will be his report on the outcome of the referendum in Ireland on the Nice Treaty. Does he intend his report to be simply a statement of fact or will he take the opportunity to outline to his counterparts how he intends to proceed in order to ensure the Nice Treaty may be ratified in Ireland?</P>

I will make as detailed a report as possible on what happened in the referendum and some of the decisions we have taken. However, I will not be setting out a strategy of how we intend to deal with this issue. In the light of events at the General Affairs Council and on foot of discussions with President Prodi and others at the Commission, the meeting of the Cabinet committee on European affairs later this evening will consider all options and strategies and not make a quick decision. I will do nothing other than reiterate that this country is in favour of the enlargement process. I do not wish to seek to derail that process, but will explain that there are other issues with which we must find a method of dealing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put three questions to the Taoiseach in relation to the last point he made. With regard to the issues other than enlargement which were of concern to the Irish people when making up their minds on the Nice Treaty, in his discussions with Prime Minister <Col N="53" /> Persson did the Taoiseach debate the implications of the treaty for Sweden, a country which has remained neutral and which has a long and distinguished tradition in that regard for 200 years? Was the possibility of the defeat of the referendum on the Nice Treaty discussed? What contingency arrangements, if any, were discussed? I welcome last night's announcement by the Taoiseach to accept the Labour Party's proposal to establish a forum modelled on the New Ireland Forum to discuss the structure of a developing Europe in order that we can build in this country the broadest possible consensus, based on complete understanding of in what way and how Europe is to develop. In this context, will the Taoiseach indicate how he proposes to make the forum as inclusive as possible? Has he given any thought to who should chair it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Swedes see no difficulty whatever being posed by any aspect of the Nice Treaty to their neutrality and they totally support it. It is not for me to paraphrase what he said, but, when asked questions about this matter, Goran Persson stated at his press conference that neither he nor any lobby group in his country could see why people would be concerned about this issue because, as the Deputy stated, his country has remained passionately neutral for 200 years. Other than discussing the result and hoping it would be a positive one, we did not discuss the negatives of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote. I outlined to him a number of issues which would arise and which were on the periphery of the Nice Treaty. His view was that these were not included in the treaty. As he said in his various press conferences and statements, those who worked on the Nice Treaty perceived and believed it to be the treaty of enlargement. He did not see the issues I raised as being part of the Nice Treaty.</P>
      <P>I have not given any consideration to a chairperson of the forum. As with the other forums, it is best that it be an independent person involved in these issues. There are a number of such people. I will consult the political parties on the matter, something I did on previous occasions, such as the second forum in which I was involved and for which I followed the same process. I would like it to be a broadly based forum, but it is not possible to have a forum of political parties represented in the House, the model used for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation which worked very well, while also including the social partners, which represent the broad base of people in the organised labour movement and employers, and others, such as farmers, who represent broad aspects of society. While it is not possible to include everyone, the use of submissions and presentations should assist in making it a broadly based forum.</P>

      <P>There are many issues, such as NATO, neutrality, military alliances, superpowers, the rapid reaction force and the concerns expressed by the main lobby groups in their position papers. These were well reported in the applicant countries and the international press in recent days, but I do not intend to dwell on this.</P>
      <P>We must endeavour to build a consensus around how we can deal with the enlargement issue and explain to the applicant countries how we can begin to do this. The forum is one way we can do this and outline our continued support for the European model and the enlargement process. We must also make clear to the applicant countries the fact that not once in the campaign did anyone argue against the process of or date for enlargement. I will reflect the views of the people and Members given in the debate last night. I intend to give a comprehensive report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In as much as the Taoiseach does not represent the consensus of the people on the <Col N="55" /> question of neutrality, the Swedish Prime Minister might find he has a similar problem in Sweden. That, however, is a matter for another day.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach when he goes to Gothenburg talk more than just about the difficulty following the referendum on the Nice Treaty and say it was rejected? Can he bring himself to say this? Is it not undemocratic to ignore that decision and say at the same time that ratification will proceed as before? Will he be more legally correct in his words to his EU partners by saying that ratification will proceed if the Nice Treaty is amended or renegotiated and a further referendum is held, but not before?</P>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach answer a question about another aspect of the Gothenburg summit which will also deal with common security and defence? Does he regret that the referendum he promised on Partnership for Peace was not proceeded with to provide a certain amount of clarity which is needed from the people for the Nice Treaty? Is there a way of making up for this by holding a referendum on neutrality?</P>
      <P>The summit will also deal with sustainability and climate change. Is the Taoiseach in a position to say to EU member states that Ireland is also likely to fail in complying with the targets set down under the Kyoto Protocol as part of the EU package? Has that become known to our EU partners yet or are we waiting for the final day to make this information known to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said yesterday and today that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote won last week and that the Nice Treaty was rejected. That was the result of the vote. That said, it is not fair to comment on how I put that view to our EU partners because we must balance a number of realities. One is that every member state has a sovereign right to ratify the treaty in whatever way it chooses on the basis of its own constitutional procedures. Much has been written in recent days by people on the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side that everything should now stop. That is incorrect. It is not for us to lecture other countries about their constitutional procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot go the whole way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but that is not what has been said in recent days. It has been said that I should call a halt to the ratification process by saying no one else can proceed with it. That has been put forward by some of Deputy Sargent's colleagues, but it is factually and legally incorrect to say so. It is misinformation. Each individual country has a sovereign right to ratify the treaty on the basis of its constitutional process. I have no right to interfere with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reality that must be balanced is the consensus view within the Union that the ratification of the Nice Treaty is necessary for enlargement to proceed. That is the view in Ireland also. The people who argued against the Nice Treaty <Col N="56" /> made it very clear in their broadcasts and presentations that they did not oppose enlargement. They did not win the vote on the basis of opposing enlargement. They were asked about it and were upfront and said they were in favour of enlargement.</P>
    <P>The third reality is that there is strong support for enlargement across the board and we must find an agreed way forward. I do not suggest what that might be because I do not have it and, even if I thought I had it, it would be wrong for me to put it forward. We must work to see if we can obtain consensus on it. Ultimately the people have the right to make a decision and I accept that that is the main right. Nonetheless, we have an obligation in this area.</P>
    <P>There will be much discussion on sustainable development and the Kyoto Protocol this weekend. President Bush will attend the working dinner tomorrow evening when Kyoto and the Middle East are the two issues to be discussed. Europe will state its position, as it has done since President Bush made his first statement on this matter at the beginning of March last. I will support the European position on the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
    <P>Some of the other countries, and the Swedish Presidency, believe we should be more specific on some of these issues. I know the Deputy is aware of this because he alluded to it recently in a parliamentary question. That will also be discussed. It is not an agreed position. The view is that we should first implement what we are committed to under the Kyoto agreement. When he was here on 30 May, President Goran Persson said he would continue to press for more specificity. That would form part of the debate, if not tomorrow evening then on Friday and Saturday.</P>

        <b>: </b>Will the Taoiseach convey to EU leaders in Gothenburg this weekend that their reaction and that of the permanent <Col N="57" /> EU bureaucracy to the rejection of the Nice treaty by the Irish people illustrates the view of many people in this country that democracy in the EU is a concept and not a reality and that a referendum is a pretence at consultation but not a genuine consultation, because any negative decision by the people &ndash; presumably of any member state &ndash; is not accepted?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Government do not accept the decision of the people. All their words since the referendum have been concerned with their need to dress up the Nice treaty and force it down the throats of the population. Will the Taoiseach convey this feeling to the EU leaders? They have been afraid to consult their own people on this question because they fear they will get the result we did in Ireland. Where does this leave the concept of democracy in the EU?</P>
      <P>In the sphere of economic policy, how is the massive power of the multinational corporate sector reflected at EU summits with regard to privatisation, for example? Does the Taoiseach agree that EU summits merely amount to window dressing for decisions which are made elsewhere, particularly by the corporate sector, and are not really democratic?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told us yesterday that the proposed forum on the EU would consist of the major political parties in the Dáil and the, so-called, social partners &ndash; business, trade union leaders and farming organisations. Does the Taoiseach not see that these are precisely the sectors of society which encouraged, pressurised and cajoled the people to vote for the Nice treaty and whose advice was rejected? What new dimension does the Taoiseach think these groups can bring to the forum? Will the Taoiseach make provision, therefore, for the 54% &ndash; the ordinary people &ndash; to be represented?</P>

        <b>:</b> I merely wish the Taoiseach to convey a simple matter. Will he convey the revulsion of the people at the circus conducted by his Government around the execution of the perpetrator of the Oklahoma bombing? I need hardly say what an unspeakable crime that was. Will the Taoiseach convey to President Bush the wisdom of the people who, by their vote last week to outlaw the death penalty in all cases, <Col N="58" /> rejected the idea that the appalling wrong which murder does can somehow be redeemed by the State descending to the same depravity and even involving those who were deprived of their loved ones by the crime?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as there is a question in all of that, I believe the Deputy is asking if I believe the multinational corporations and capitalists of the world are represented in some direct or indirect way around the European council table. I do not. They are the leaders of the sovereign countries of Europe representing their people and they are democratically elected. Around the European Council are groups, and politicians from all over Europe who feed into those groups, who meet also. It is an extremely democratic process representing the views and interests of all of the people. They are not motivated in the way mentioned by the Deputy. The work of the Councils and the decisions made by them are in the best interests of their people.</P>
      <P>I have answered the question about last week's position. On the one hand the Deputy wants me to tell the European leaders not to criticise our procedures and, on the other, to tell them to hold referendums in their countries. Each member state follows its own constitutional procedure. I have no intention of telling member states who have a sovereign right to ratify the treaty how they should do so. They will do so as they choose. The Deputy is contradicting himself. He says I should tell them not to admonish us and at the same time to admonish them.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach a report from the Swedish Prime Minister on his discussions with the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the Palestinian state? Does the Government support the initiative of the United States on ceasefire proposals for the Middle East? What exactly will the Taoiseach say about the Irish view of the current situation in the Middle East? The Swedish Presidency will host a dinner which is to be attended by President Bush. Is the Taoiseach concerned that the Government's lack of enforcement of its own commitments under the Kyoto protocol will diminish his moral authority in pressurising the American President to live up to the arrangements freely entered into by his predecessor?</P>

      <P>I wish to return to a question I asked earlier concerning climate change. Given that we have set ourselves on this course, the Government will have to report three breaches of the commitment that we made at Kyoto. If the Taoiseach is asked in Gothenburg, &ldquo;How are you getting on, Mr. Ahern, with your compliance with the Kyoto protocol?&rdquo;, will he simply reply that we have a very strong view on the matter? Or, will he say that we have an appalling record? Will the Taoiseach make it clear that we have problems in that area and not just with the Nice treaty?</P>

Will the Taoiseach comment on that? Will the proposed forum on Europe, which the Taoiseach is to establish, provide for public fora at which people can discuss European issues, including the Nice treaty and the bureaucratic red tape caused by the Departments I have mentioned?</P>

It is important to note that we are dealing in time frames.</P>
      <P>There is a general communications deficit between this State and the EU. One of the problems arises from the fact that our members of the European Parliament, who are ambassadors to Europe, do not have a domestic platform on which to vent their opinions. It is the fault of the Taoiseach and of his Government that little progress has been made on Dáil reform to allow for the participation of EU Commissioners and MEPs before the Seanad and Oireachtas committees. It is one of the reasons there was such inertia among voters last week.</P>

While we might be in breach of some objectives, we are not the only offenders. However, we are also well within the objectives in many other areas.

At today's EU-US Summit it is hoped to develop those proposals somewhat. Naturally, we support them, which is the question the Deputy asked. An effort is being made to try to have a greater EU dimension in these proposals. That did not happen during the last US Administration but the Americans are now more on side for this. In recent weeks, the EU has had its own people working on this matter in Israel, and the President of the European Council hopes for an imminent breakthrough. At least, an improvement of the situation will be reported after the EU-US Summit tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>In his judgment delivered on 24 May last, Mr. Justice Smellie indicated that Ansbacher Cayman Ltd. shall divulge to the inspectors confidential information disclosed during the proceedings to the Grand Court. However, references to names and addresses which might disclose the identities of clients are to be deleted. In the event that the inspectors wish to put specific questions to any of those clients who were party to the application to the Grand Court, they may do so through Ansbacher.</P>
      <P>Arising from my petition, the High Court appointed inspectors to Ansbacher Cayman Ltd. in September 1999. These inspectors are accountable only to the High Court for the performance of their tasks. I was not a party to the recent proceedings in the Cayman which resulted in the judgment delivered on 24 May last.</P>
      <P>An appeal by the inspectors against the judgment is unlikely. This arises for a number of reasons but, principally, the delay which such an appeal would necessitate. Moreover, I am sure the inspectors have gathered a substantial amount of information since their appointment in September 1999. However, an appeal is strictly a matter for them.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the inspectors as to whether they will produce an interim report. I can see little useful purpose in producing same as it would not reflect the final position of the inspectors. Notwithstanding the recent judgment of the Cayman Grand Court, I hope the inspectors will produce a substantial report by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste is on record in the wake of the judgment as saying that it was a setback, but not one of fatal proportions. Where precisely do matters stand? Can she confirm that, notwithstanding the judgment, she is in possession of a number of names? Will she further confirm that because of information to which she was party she has in the past 18 months or so, when the occasion was deemed suitable, whipped up public opinion to the effect that this matter would be concluded to the satisfaction of everybody involved, the names would be published and consequently action would be taken in the form of court proceedings in this jurisdiction despite us facing a situation where little, if any, progress has been made and we have nothing more than a hill <Col N="63" /> of beans as far as the Ansbacher debacle is concerned and she is not in a position to advance matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly resent the Deputy's inference that there is a sense of irresponsibility about this issue. He made a reference to me whipping up matters. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners addressed the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday when he had much to say about this matter. I was not at the meeting, but I understand he stated there could be up to 400 names. We have considerable information and there was significant detail and a large number of names in Gerard Ryan's interim report, which the inspectors received.</P>
      <P>Following the judgment in the Cayman Islands there was a view here that perhaps that was the end of the road and that the inspectors would not be able to obtain information on individuals. They have substantial information. I am sure they have much more information as a result of the interviews they have conducted and the further investigations they have undertaken than they had when they received Gerard Ryan's interim report.</P>
      <P>It was unfortunate that the Caymans judgment did not favour Ansbacher bank, which took the case, but it is not the end of the road. I hope, later this year there will be a full report to the High Court by the inspectors who are working extraordinarily hard. Unfortunately, Mr. Justice Costello had to stand down for health reasons and was replaced by two people, Judge O'Leary and Michael Cush, SC, to expedite the work of the inspectors because of the volume of work involved.</P>
      <P>The Ansbacher files do not only contain my view. Several tribunals have referred to the bank accounts. The McCracken tribunal first uncovered this set of accounts and other tribunals have since through clients which have come before them referred to the Ansbacher accounts. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners also referred to them yesterday. The Revenue is proceeding with its own inquiries in regard to this matter and I understand the chairman made it very clear what action it intends to take. I am very optimistic in regard to the report that will be submitted by the inspectors, I hope later this year, to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time the Tánaiste has informed the House that the report will be ready by the end of the year. Will she say that again with a full sense of responsibility because even those of us on all sides of the House who have supported these investigations, this investigation especially, are fearful that costs are mounting, time is passing and there is no prospect of the matter reaching finality? People would like to be assured on that score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it the case that the entire objective of the recent court case was to establish names and the <Col N="64" /> ruling was that the supply of names was precluded? Is that a blow to the Ansbacher investigation? If not, will the Tánaiste clarify the reason she remains optimistic?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate my earlier comments. I hope the report will be before the High Court later this year. The inspectors do not report to me, nor do I receive information from them, but, given that there are now four inspectors who are working extraordinary hours to get through a large volume of work, that is my hope and that of others.</P>
      <P>The case was taken by the bank, not the inspectors who sought information from the bank. The bank indicated it wished to co-operate, but wanted court clearance. I was never that optimistic it would win. The Cayman Islands have built their reputation on confidentiality in regard to these matters. I was hopeful the bank would win and it would have been better if the inspectors could have obtained all the details they desired, but it would be wrong of anyone to assume they do not have a large number of names as they have considerably more detail than they had when they received Gerard Ryan's report in September 1991. The report included, as was stated in the affidavit, the names of at least 120 persons. Since then other names have come into the public domain through both the Moriarty and Flood tribunals. Additional names have come into the possession of the authorities here and the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners referred to a larger number of names yesterday.</P>
      <P>Given the powers of the inspectors, which exceeded those of Gerard Ryan, including the power to interview third parties which Mr. Ryan did not have, and that they are receiving co-operation from some people, which I welcome, I am optimistic they will produce a thorough report. It will not be as thorough as it might have been had they received the names and details from the Cayman Islands, but the additional information they have received will also help them. I could not, therefore, describe the judgment in the Cayman Islands, disappointing and all as it was, as a fatal blow to the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>One aspect of the judgment about which there can be some optimism was the ruling that certain information should be supplied by the bank to the inspectorate. Now that the time for appeal has elapsed, will the Tánaiste confirm whether this information has been formally sought, is in the course of transmission or has already been transmitted? What type of information does she envisage will be forthcoming?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to confirm anything to the House because the inspectors report to the court, not me. They act completely independently. They have an outstanding reputation and significant financial and legal expertise. They will leave no stone unturned to obtain the information they require. Unfortunately, the <Col N="65" /> reason this has taken longer than one might have anticipated is because of constant litigation by some people who felt this information would never come to the attention of the authorities and have gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal their identity and the information from the inspectors. The same has happened with some of the tribunals. Litigation has delayed many of these inquiries more than we expected. However, I am optimistic the inspectors will seek whatever information they can and bear in mind the judgment of the court regarding any information they need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste telling the House that the inspectors have resolved not to appeal this case? What is her current state of knowledge in terms of the number of deposit holders here? She adverted to the presentation of the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners to the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday. I was present and followed it closely. I did not hear him say there were 400 account holders, I heard him say the 120 names were only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
      <P>Given that the revelation of the names is precluded in the fashion described by Mr. Justice Smellie, how is the Tánaiste confident that, for example, ensuing prosecutions are possible where it is not possible to connect an account to a specific name?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the 120 names, that report was given to the Revenue Commissioners at the time. I understand from public comments made by the Revenue Commissioners, not from any private information I have, that they have been making considerable progress with that report. That may have been confirmed yesterday. I was not at the meeting yesterday. I understood from a newspaper source, but I may be inaccurate, that the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners spoke of a figure of 400. If he spoke about it being the tip of the iceberg and not 400, I apologise because it is my mistake.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the Ansbacher report names have come into the public domain. One such name referred to a former member of the Committee on Public Accounts, for example, and that is public knowledge. Other names have come before the different tribunals. There has been a huge correlation between some of the subsequent reports Mr. Ryan made. Both the inspectors and the Revenue have information about a large number of individuals. Where the figure falls is not the relevant matter. What is important is that such information is pursued and those who have been evading their taxation and other responsibilities are brought to justice. I am optimistic that will happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Community employment is a work experience programme whose primary role is to assist the progression of participants into jobs and or further education and training. FÁS has operational responsibility for the delivery of the programme which currently has approximately 33,500 participants.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision to restructure the programme in July 1999, the numbers employed on community employment will reduce to 28,000 by the end of 2003. The reduction in absolute numbers participating, together with the changed eligibility criteria, are considered to be appropriate given the present economic climate and buoyancy in employment projections. Consultations with relevant Departments are currently taking place to progress the mainstreaming of essential services currently undertaken by participants on the community employment programme. Mainstreaming these services should enhance the services being provided and provide employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed. Mainstreaming community employment services will further reduce participation levels below the restructuring target of 28,000 by 2003. Discussions with the Department of Education and Science with regard to schools services are at an advanced stage and I intend to begin the mainstreaming process and to transfer community employment funding freed up by the reduction in community employment positions in schools to that Department in time for the new school year in September next.</P>
      <P>My Department is finalising proposals for a new high support process, as required under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which will enhance the range of options available for job seekers with particular employment barriers. Further consultations with the social partners on the high support process are due to take place shortly.</P>
      <P>My Department is also considering with FÁS the issue of older persons, workers in rural areas and others who have previously participated on community employment and who are having difficulty progressing to open employment. This issue will be considered in the context of developing policy for the high support process and in the light of the implications of both elements for the future operation of community employment following mainstreaming of essential services. The present labour market shortages and the dramatic reductions in the numbers of long-term unemployed provide an unprecedented opportunity to reintegrate into the work force persons who have been participating in labour market programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the bulk of what the Minister said. However, some aspects still give rise to grave concern, particularly in rural communities. I appeal for flexibility. Does the Mini<Col N="67" /> ster accept that there are parts of the country, particularly in disadvantaged rural areas, which are unemployment black spots where the inflexibility shown under the community employment schemes is causing difficulties? I refer to the three year rule, notwithstanding what the Minister said about moving people from schemes into mainstream employment, which should be welcomed. However, it does not always fit in every case. Community employment schemes have been a mainstay of employment in many parts of the country in recent years. There are large areas in parts of the midlands, for example, where the major employer is FÁS under the community employment programme. However, inflexibility is causing hardship because there is a lack of choice. While we are experiencing low unemployment levels and a jobs boom, if one could call it that, there are tens of thousands of people who do not have any choice but to remain in the community employment scheme and who are now suffering because of the inflexibility of the new rules, particularly the three year rule and that related to older persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what Deputy Flanagan said. We have not discontinued community employment for two reasons. First, some individuals who, for reasons relating to age and barriers relating to their location, particularly in rural areas, cannot find jobs in the open labour market. The jobs are either not there or a person's circumstances means he or she does not have the wherewithal or the qualifications or skills. Second, much worthwhile activity has been undertaken in recent years through community employment, such as providing support for disabled people and maintaining schools which could not have been run as efficiently without it. That is why I am determined not to displace it without replacing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are beginning by mainstreaming the schools. The purpose of the new high support process is to try to identify those categories of individuals, such as people on jobs initiatives and others, who require ongoing and intensive support. It is my intention that when we have completed an analysis of the employability study, which was carried out by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and recently published, in conjunction with the discussions we are having with the social partners, those activities which should be mainstreamed, such as maintenance of schools, will be mainstreamed. It is not satisfactory that every year a school wonders if it will have a caretaker, secretary or teaching assistant. We want to give responsibility for that to the Department of Education and Science and give permanency both to the jobs and to the situation in the schools. I hope to do the same in the Department of Health and Children in relation to those who work in health related areas and perhaps in the Department of the Environment and Local Government in <Col N="68" /> relation to those who work on environmental projects. We must have the type of flexibility the Deputy suggested for other people.</P>

      <P>I am answering this question on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, who is at an international labour conference.</P>
      <P>I understand this question refers to the employment rights of non-nationals. I am aware of reports on the treatment of certain non-nationals placed in employment here on foot of work permit applications. Any abuses of statutory employment rights and protections that immigrant workers may have been subjected to are to be unreservedly condemned and we are on record in this regard already.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the increasing workload of the labour inspectorate, the Government in December 1999 made a decision to strengthen the service to 17 personnel by appointing seven additional authorised officers. These officers operate objectively and without any differentiation with respect to nationality, as all employees in this country are entitled to the protection of Irish employment rights legislation. Employment rights legislation establishes the minimum statutory rights applicable to all 1.8 million people working in Ireland, whether part-time or full-time, high or low skill or whether they are Irish citizens or otherwise. Inspectors, as authorised officers, enforce these entitlements and carry out investigations under the provisions of the various enactments. In this regard the inspectorate can pursue allegations of workers being subjected to excessive working hours, illegal deductions, non-payment of compensation for Sunday working or of holiday-public holiday pay, etc. Inspectors seek to ensure that employers become compliant and pay any sums due to employees. Last year arrears of £283,998 were recovered for employees and, to the end of May this year, £102,134 has been recovered for employees. If compliance is not achieved, prosecutions are initiated or employees advised of the recourse route available to them under legislation, for example, to a rights commissioner, an employment appeals tribunal, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>In liaison with the work permits section of our Department the labour inspectorate is concentrating its activities on sectors which have a high level of immigrant workers, for example, agri<Col N="69" /> culture, hotels and catering, the services sector, and retailing.</P>
    <P>Consultants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, are in the process of finalising a review of the processes and supporting systems in the employment rights information, inspection and enforcement functions. While the consultants are recommending more staff and resources for some of the functions mentioned, they point out that there are administrative and structural issues that need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Preparatory work is under way on the introduction of legislation on work permits. The legislation, which is anticipated for autumn next, will establish work permits on a statutory basis. Work has been completed on the revision of the work permit application form which will ensure that prospective immigrants are alerted to relevant key provisions of Irish labour legislation. In addition, an explanatory leaflet in eight languages is now available.</P>

      <P>How does the Minister expect 17 people to police the whole country? How will Ireland take its place among the most advanced competitive economies in the world? The Minister faces huge problems because we expect up to 200,000 immigrants in the next six years. How often do inspections of the companies granting large scale visas take place and what have been the results?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government authorised the appointment of seven extra staff in December 1999. This group took up office last year. Between April 2000 and April 2001 the labour inspectorate undertook 4,350 inspections and follow-up complaints, 200 of which were related to work permits. In the 125 cases related to work permits completed to date nothing untoward has been found.</P>
      <P>A total of 108 issues are being examined, 24 of which are in the agriculture sector, eight in construction and engineering, 33 in hotel and catering, 16 in nursing, nine in retail and 18 in various other sectors. These inquiries concern workers from Russia, Lithuania, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, China, Bulgaria, the Philippines, Pakistan, Ukraine, Estonia, India, Croatia, Australia, New Zealand and Bosnia. Given the volume of work and the diversity of the many people involved in these cases, I conclude that the inspectorate is doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>These are new circumstances and we must allow them to develop. I assure the Deputy that if we feel a necessity to supplement the numbers as a result of the large number of work permits being granted under this Government, notably in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the leadership of the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, we will respond. At present, we are satisfied with the high quality and professionalism of these inspectors. They are doing an excellent job.</P>

      <P>It is disgraceful that such a small number of people have been allocated to this task when so many people are entering the country. Is the Minister aware that racism is on the rise and must be rooted out? The number of people employed in the inspectorate is a mark of Government failure. Seven additional staff bringing the total to 17 cannot deal with so many diverse tasks in addition to the huge problems we face with up to 200,000 people poised to enter the country to fill vacancies. We must also bear in mind the countries of origin of these new immigrants. The Minister is not dealing with the problem.</P>
      <P>There is no education in small companies in the north west. This is creating difficulties in the workplace.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's assertion that this Government is not dealing with the issue. The 4,350 investigations carried out by the labour inspectorate constitutes a huge volume of work. The vast majority of employers comply with the law. Apart from the fact that inspectors must deal with all official complaints they receive, individuals making complaints have direct recourse to a rights commissioner, the employment appeals tribunal and other channels. Taken together, these facts demonstrate that the system is working well and should be given time to develop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has already been extensive examination of the factors contributing to the relatively high level of insurance costs in Ireland. Insurance price movements are normally based on the underwriting experience of companies, as well as trends in the level, frequency and cost of claims. The high transaction cost of claims, particularly legal costs, has been identified as one of the major factors driving up the cost of personal injury settlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time now, this Government has been concerned at the high, and increasing, cost of insurance. I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by some companies due to these costs. The decision of this Government to establish a personal injuries assessment board by next year seeks to address the issue of the high cost of settling claims by achieving a reduction in the <Col N="71" /> delivery cost of personal injury compensation for work related injuries.</P>
    <P>In addition, a workplace safety group has been established with a view to improving health and safety standards in the workplace. The objectives are to reduce workplace accidents, encourage injured workers to return to the workplace at the earliest possible date and improve claims handling procedures, thus reducing insurance costs. The group is developing proposals designed to bring the initiative to small and medium sized firms.</P>
    <P>Since the transposition into Irish law of the EU Third Life and Non-Life Insurance Directives in 1994, insurance companies authorised in any member state may provide insurance cover throughout the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation. This has opened up the Irish market to competition from insurance providers in other EU countries. In addition, the removal of the cap on brokers' commission will encourage further competition in the Irish market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has failed to encourage international competition into the Irish market. Will he explain why the number of claims in this country is seven times higher than in the UK? Premium increases of 40% are a national scandal. The cost increases for employers together with public liability will result in under-insurance and, in certain cases, closures of businesses. Competition is lacking and there are problems with litigation. Does the Minister have any powers to intervene in that area? Litigation through the courts is widespread and costs are far too high when 44% of a claim can be consumed by legal costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that we have failed. There are 521 companies authorised to provide insurance cover here, 398 of which are foreign. Many companies choose not to operate here because they find the insurance sector unprofitable.</P>
      <P>We cannot be compared to the United Kingdom, which has a much bigger population, greater competition among insurance companies with higher levels of investment and greater opportunities to make profits. We have a smaller population, a higher propensity for claims, higher awards, including higher costs associated with delivering awards, and greater involvement of the legal profession in delivering awards in comparison with the UK. This is the reason for the high insurance claims that are prevalent here. The consumer is the victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is addressing all aspects of the high costs of insurance. We need to bear in mind the irresponsibility of people who drive without insurance. This costs the insurance companies huge amounts of money every year in compensatory payments to the motor insurance bureau. There is nothing conceivable that we <Col N="72" /> have not considered to reduce the costs of insurance. The Government established the personal injuries assessment board which is due to commence operations on 1 January. We are confident it will make a huge contribution without infringing on the right of citizens to continue to pursue the legal route and the law of tort if they so wish. I cannot understand how the Deputy arrives at his conclusions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Insurance liability is the issue, not car insurance. I was referring to small companies and their high insurance costs. The Minister commented on an entirely different matter. We are not discussing young drivers, but people engaged in business for 25 and 30 years whose costs are constantly increasing, which is altogether different.</P>

      <P>I did not mention motor insurance in my response. I referred to the costs of claims across the board, in every area of activity including employers' liability and personal injury. It is a very serious matter and the Government is concerned. There has been a major increase in the percentage of payroll taken up by employers' liability. It rose from 1.95% in 1999 to 2.7% this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 13,316 redundancies were notified to my Department in 2000. A further 7,367 redundancies were notified in the first five months of 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent job loss announcements are a reminder to us that, notwithstanding the continuing success of the economy, maintaining our competitiveness remains a key challenge. Jobs in relatively low skill areas are particularly vulnerable in an increasingly global economy. Many of the recent job losses are a result of the restructuring process ongoing in industry in Ireland whereby activities <Col N="74" /> at the lower end of the value added scale are being phased out as these activities become uneconomic in an Irish context. Assisting companies to move up the value chain into higher skilled and more secure jobs remains a priority of current policy being implemented by the State agencies.</P>
    <P>The slowdown in the US economy is having a negative impact on the overseas-owned manufacturing sector in Ireland. The impact to date on the economy in terms of GNP growth and unemployment has been quite small, mainly confined to the information technology related sectors. Other sectors such as pharmaceuticals, health care and most internationally traded services are, to date, largely unaffected.</P>
    <P>As well as job losses, this impact has manifested itself in a slowdown in both recruitment and planned expansions by some major multinational companies. As regards indigenous Irish companies, the main impact has been a slowdown in expansion plans for exports and an increasing difficulty for indigenous technology firms in gaining access to funding for current and future projects while the US economic climate remains in its current condition.</P>
    <P>Where job losses occur, the State agencies work closely together and with local authorities and other local development interests to facilitate an integrated development approach in the matter of attraction of replacement projects, expansion of existing industry and provision of retraining.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we continue to focus on the issues over which we have control and which impact significantly on the competitiveness of Ireland as a base for investment. Key issues include the implementation of the national development plan, particularly the roll-out of infrastructure into the regions, wage and price inflation, ensuring a stable industrial relations environment and adequate skills supply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the IT sector, on which our job statistics have become increasingly dependent in recent years in terms of a positive sheen, not only in relation to actual job losses but, equally important, the warnings from across the Atlantic about the postponement of future development and also warnings of job losses later this year, what steps has the Minister taken to deal with this matter? For example, has she arranged meetings with the heads of any multinational corporations? Does she intend travelling to the United States to discuss Ireland's position in terms of the global development of these multinational companies with regard to job losses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong to assume that all our eggs are in what is called the electronics basket. We have a fairly good spread between the pharmaceutical industry and the health care-medical devices industry, both of which are still doing well. Biotechnology and internationally traded services are doing well. I have spoken to a number of the companies. The chairman and <Col N="75" /> chief executive officer of Intel in the United States is coming to see me next week. I have spoken to Intel on a number of occasions because it has postponed its expansion at Leixlip. It assures me it will go ahead, but until the position in the United States is more certain, companies such as this have, for the moment, held back on possible expansions.</P>
      <P>We have been fortunate because of the strategic nature of most of the operations in Ireland which are, in many cases, stand alone and here to supply the European market. They are far more dependent on the conditions in Europe than on the conditions back home, except to say that if the environment back home is not as favourable as it was, it will affect their future expansion. In relation to their current numbers, generally speaking, job numbers are holding up well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The questioning and answering have concentrated on the IT and electronics sector, but is it not the case that the rate of attrition is in the more traditional sectors? Does the Minister not agree that 21,000 redundancies since the beginning of last year is a huge rate of attrition? She said the slowdown in the United States has had only an imperceptible impact here. This goes to show the enormous impact there would be if we regard 21,000 job losses as relatively minor. One only has to look at the rate of job losses in the midlands, for example, or County Donegal, and even Peerless Rugs in Athy which lost 60 jobs last week. Is it not the case that the jobs support agencies appear to have taken the position that there is nothing they can do to support the retention of jobs in Ireland in the more traditional sectors and that we have to, as the cliché goes, move up the value chain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is worrying that we are losing so many jobs in what he calls the traditional sector. It is worrying for two reasons. First, if the economy was not in such a healthy state and unemployment so low, with the other sectors doing well, we could have major problems and, second, many of these jobs are in peripheral areas. They tend to be heavily concentrated in the midlands, for example. County Donegal was heavily dependent on the textile industry and, therefore, they have huge local impact. The losses often occur in places where it is not that easy to secure alternative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong to say that the agencies are not concentrated on this matter. The whole <i>raison d'être</i> of bringing the trade board and the company development functions of Forbairt together was precisely to help make Irish companies more competitive; using jargon like &ldquo;up the value chain&rdquo; does not sound very attractive. Given the wage base in the economy, if we are just involved in basic manufacturing, we are not at the races. We have seen some fantastic examples of where Irish companies have been helped. Michael H in the clothing sector, for example, is one of the <Col N="76" /> most successful companies because it has put what I call a hi-tech strategy into what is a very traditional sector. There are huge possibilities for other companies to do likewise.</P>

      <P>Two factories in Carndonagh downsized in the past month. Where stands the textile industry for Inishowen? Are the early warning systems still in place? Will the Minister agree that the fact that the IDA did not sign over ten acres of land to Donegal County Council, which has been sought for the past four years, if not longer, is delaying a project to establish ten development units? I was given an undertaking that it would be signed over on 27 November last year. To my knowledge it has not been signed over. What impact is the IDA having on us when it cannot even sign over land for use by others to create jobs? </P>
      <P>Given the interest that the Minister has shown in this area, which I appreciate, will she consider inviting, post-14 June, IBEC, IDA and Enterprise Ireland clients to County Donegal to meet the Donegal County Development Board and public representatives in order that we can start selling this beautiful county, which has so much potential, to them?</P>

The Deputy will acknowledge that, for obvious reasons, I have spent more time in County Donegal in the past couple of years than in most other areas. I am not familiar with the details regarding the ten acres but I will look into the matter and refer back to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The textile industry in County Donegal is in difficulty and even some of the traditional companies are examining the possibility of out-sourcing manufacturing because they find it hard to compete with products from lower wage economies. I hope we can keep much of the value-added end of the business in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is some good news on the way for County Donegal. The FDI section has been active in visiting the county which offers significant attractions. If the inward investment pipeline remains as it has been for the past while I hope we will see some positive news for County Donegal and other areas in the near future. I intend to go to the enterprise day in County Donegal. I do not know if I will be able to spend the whole day as suggested by Deputy Keaveney, but I will meet some of the groups she has suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems we are agreed that the phenomenal rate of job growth in recent times has concealed the rate of attrition in more traditional sectors. Is the Minister satisfied no further actions can be taken by the job support agencies in terms of measures being put in place in advance of these closures which are occurring at a sufficiently frequent rate to be a cause of concern, particularly in the indigenous sector?</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to mention counties because Deputy Wall will mention Athy. However, four counties have not done well with regard to FDI recently, namely, Laois, Offaly, Wexford and north Tipperary &ndash; south Tipperary has done well. There has been much down-sizing in these areas and we have not been able to find replacement industries.</P>
      <P>A number of things are happening. One of the purposes of the national training fund is to help up-skill the existing work force with a view to making people more flexible for alternative employment. There is some capacity to assist companies to put in the technology and develop the strategy to survive, even in difficult circumstances. We have seen some good examples in this regard. Unfortunately it is not successful with all companies, notwithstanding the available assistance.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> A major event takes place for the first time tomorrow in the Stillorgan Park Hotel organised by Enterprise Ireland involving Dublin based companies which are examining relocating current expansion plans to locations outside Dublin. I hope some of these regional locations will feature in some of those plans. It is my intention that we can sell the attractions of regional locations such as Athy, Wexford, Laois, Offaly and north Tipperary which have not done so well. Such locations would not ever have been considered.</P>
    <P>However, there were two good examples of this recently. In one case, Bank of Ireland decided to locate its new joint venture with Nova in Arklow with the creation of 800 jobs. Other companies have gone to Kilkenny. Many Dublin-based companies are looking at regional locations because of the congestion, difficulty in retaining staff and the cost of houses in Dublin. In addition to FDI, this offers possibilities for some of the towns which have not done so well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to this question on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt. The report of the Task Force on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying is a comprehensive examination of the issue of workplace bullying.</P>
      <P>The task force had three basic terms of reference which were: to identify the size of the problem and the sectors most at risk; to develop practical programmes and strategies to prevent workplace bullying; and to produce a co-ordinated response from the State agencies.</P>
      <P>Following a detailed examination of the issue of workplace bullying, and taking full account of all the findings of the national survey on workplace bullying, as conducted by the ESRI, the task force made a number of wide-ranging recommendations requiring action at State and at enterprise levels.</P>
      <P>The recommendations relating to action at State level include the designation of the Health and Safety Authority as the central co-ordinating State agency, the introduction of codes of practice on workplace bullying and harassment under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the establishment of an advisory Committee on Workplace Bullying under the auspices of the HSA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that work is being advanced on the implementation of these recommendations. The advisory committee has been set up already by the HSA with representation from the main State agencies and the social partners, while work <Col N="79" /> is advancing on the three codes of practice by the relevant State agencies.</P>
    <P>The role of the State has been recognised by the task force. In addition, the responsibility at local level of employers, managers and employees has also been emphasised. The report states, &ldquo;Central to the concept of an effective workplace is the commitment of management and work force to develop and maintain an atmosphere in which the dignity of each individual is respected.&rdquo;  In this regard, the task force recommended that all organisations and businesses should adopt a dignity at work charter and should also develop a separate and specific anti-bullying policy.</P>
    <P>We have asked that individual employers take on board the recommendations in the report which directly concern them, and to put in place appropriate anti-bullying measures without delay. I have encouraged all employers, as a practical first step, to adopt the dignity at work charter, as recommended by the task force.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>We have also written to the director of IBEC highlighting the fact that, in order to ensure that all of the recommendations of the task force are translated into appropriate action, a continued input from IBEC and its members at enterprise level is required.</P>
    <P>However, as the adoption of the dignity at work charter is not a statutory requirement on an employer, we do not have the data requested by the Deputy on the number of employers who have adopted the charter to date. I am confident, nonetheless, that, given that there was full social partnership representation on the task force, and that the social partners are also represented on the advisory committee, the dignity at work charter and the introduction of appropriate anti-bullying policies at enterprise level will continue to be encouraged and facilitated by all parties.</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to take serious issue with the Minister of State. However, I asked a straightforward question. The Minister of State exhausted his two minutes but did not refer to the number of employers. It is similar to Deputy Perry's experience on an earlier question. I am not sure who prepares the files for the Minister of State and what power he has to refer to, or to read, the questions. However, I asked him a specific question. We heard all this before. My question referred to the number of employers who have adopted the charter to date. I take it from the Minister of State's reply that no employers have done so. I am sure he will contradict me if I am wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am again answering on behalf of Minister of State, Deputy Kitt. In recognition of the increasing workload of the labour inspectorate, the Government in December 1999 made a decision to strengthen the service by the appointment of seven additional authorised officers. The complement of inspectors is now 17 but as a consequence of career breaks and promotions, there are currently only 14 inspectors active in the service. Steps are in train at present to restore the service to its full complement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the staffing issue, the labour inspectorate has undergone a major review of its <Col N="81" /> operations. That exercise is approaching a conclusion and it is anticipated that the effectiveness and efficiency of the service will be improved significantly as the outcome of the review is implemented over the next few months.</P>
    <P>The Department's labour inspectorate of the Department has responsibility for the enforcement of all employment rights legislation. Such legislation covers a wide range of areas including the payment of wages, organisation of working time, covering areas such as holiday entitlements, rest periods, maximum working time and night work, safeguarding of employees' rights on the transfer of undertakings, protection of young persons at work, minimum wage entitlements, provisions contained in employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements arising from industrial relations legislation.</P>
    <P>All persons employed under a contract of employment within the State are entitled to the full protection of Irish employment rights legislation. Breaches of provisions contained in the legislation may come to the attention of the Department either by way of complaint by an individual employee or other concerned person or by routine inspections carried out by the Department's labour inspectorate. Allegations of breaches of employment legislation, such as excessive working hours and non-payment of national minimum wage or holiday pay, are thoroughly investigated by the labour inspectorate.</P>
    <P>Labour inspectors have powers to enter places of work, question employers and employees and examine records. Inspectors carry out night work as part of their normal conditions of service and that element of their duties is almost exclusively related to protection of young persons enforcement work. The Department's labour inspectorate operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation with respect to nationality.</P>
    <P>Where it appears that an employer has failed to comply with the legislation and irregularities are not resolved through the co-operation of the employer in question, the matter is referred to the Department's legal advisers for consideration as to the institution of legal proceedings against the employer concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of his previous reply on work permits having been issued to workers from Latvia, Lithuania, Beijing, Newfoundland, South Africa, etc., how can 17 inspectors, three of whom are not currently active due to being on sick leave, maternity leave or whatever, police the employment rights of the workers concerned? Is it still the case that inspectors work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.? The Minister referred to the organisation of working time which implied that inspectors are present at the hour of night when young workers are supposed to finish work. If inspectors only work until 5 p.m., how can they police this area at 10 p.m.? Will the Minister comment on the particular case of the meat company <Col N="82" /> in Roscommon in which RTE revealed the abuse of and denial of rights to immigrant workers? Has the Minister had an opportunity to examine that and what is the current position?</P>

      <P>In my previous reply to which Deputy Rabbitte referred, I stated that from April 2000 to 2001, the labour inspectorate undertook 4,350 inspections and follow-up complaints, 200 of which related to work permits. It was in that context I referred to work permits for immigrant workers. Of the 200 work permit related cases investigated, full investigations have been completed in 125 cases and nothing was found to be amiss. The remaining 75 cases are still under investigation and we await the outcome.</P>

      <P>That is a different issue, one which is currently being pursued. There may have been a breach of equality law and that matter will be considered.</P>
      <P>On the working hours of labour inspectors, I understand they target both sectors and regions. When they visit regions, they deal with all aspects of inspection and investigation and, accordingly, work varying hours to ensure they cover all issues outlined in the legislation under which they operate. There is flexibility in the system. The fact that 17 people managed to carry out 4,350 investigations in the past year reflects a very high performance ratio and the inspectors are obviously doing a good job.</P>

      <P>I continue my comments on the amendment and the contributions of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. In a nutshell, the concern of the Fine Gael Party is that this vital measure be brought into force without undue delay. We would have been satisfied had the Minister assured the House that, were the Bill passed today, it was the Government's intention to complete its passage in the Seanad before the summer vacation and implement the measure in full by 1 October next. We would have been satisfied bearing in mind the time it has taken to get to this point. The Minister is unable to give the House any guarantee as to the date by which any part of the Bill will be brought into force or the date by which the provisions of the Bill will be operational. He is not even willing to agree to the inclusion in the Bill of a framework requiring him to submit to the House, at a later date, a proposal for the bringing into force of the Bill over a period of time and having it brought back to the Houses should it require adjustment. In the circumstances I am formally putting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 17, to delete lines 32 and 33 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" />&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) in case one parent cannot be located after reasonable inquiry, the other parent,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My concern here is that in situations where one parent has sole custody, the other parent may be very involved in the child's life and involved in some of the reasons the child is in difficulties. It seems wrong that there is only a requirement to contact one parent. The duty to attend and the liability to be arrested under section 91 would only apply to one parent, in most cases, mothers. I propose that we amend this so that in case one parent cannot be located after reasonable inquiry, the other parent would be.</P>
    <P>This does not impose an undue requirement on the authorities as the Minister suggested on Committee Stage. We are talking about a reasonable inquiry to locate the other parent. In fairness to the other parent and the child, and considering the important role of both parents in a child's life, an effort should be made to contact the other parent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Shortall and wish to point out an anomaly that arises. If we do not address it today, it may be addressed in the other House. The definition of &ldquo;parents&rdquo; contained in this measure says that parents in relation to a child means, as Deputy Shortall addressed the matter in subsection (<i>a</i>), &ldquo;in case one parent has the sole custody, charge or control of the child, that parent.&rdquo;  However, subsection (<i>b</i>) reads &ldquo;in case the child has been adopted, the adopter or adopters, or the surviving adopter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This seems to suggest that where a child has been adopted, both parents need to be notified of matters that arise under the Bill by virtue of the fact that they are adopters. They cannot be excluded from notification if one of them has sole custody. It seems to be an anomaly that where a married couple have adopted a child both have to be notified, but a married couple to whom a child is born &ndash; where one has sole custody although both are joint guardians because the child is a natural child &ndash; will not both be notified.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shortall's amendment is a reasonable proposal in the context in which it is framed. I add one comment which is that where one parent has sole custody of a child this does not mean both parents may under law be joint guardians of the child. If the couple are married, both are automatically guardians but this may not be the case for unmarried couples. Where one parent has sole custody, the other parent may be very actively involved in the child's life, with regular contact and access. The child may stay with that parent on different occasions, or may holiday with that parent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister have another look at the definition of &ldquo;parents&rdquo; and the manner in which it will apply and will be relevant in the operation of this legislation? There is a false assumption that many fathers who find themselves in a situation where the mother is the custodian parent are seen as largely irrelevant to a child. What we <Col N="89" /> know of family difficulties indicates that, provided the parents pose no risk or danger to a child, by and large it is normally in the interests of a child to maintain relationships with both parents. We should not ignore this in the context of this definition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;parent&rdquo; is not defined as it obviously means the father or the mother of the child. The word &ldquo;parents&rdquo; is defined not so much to indicate what it means, because again that is obvious, but to indicate when it can be taken to mean &ldquo;one parent&rdquo;. The definition used in the Bill makes it clear that &ldquo;parent&rdquo; is the one who has sole custody, charge or care of the child. That provides a clear and unambiguous meaning of the word &ldquo;parent&rdquo; in this context. It would be very much a matter of fact which parent has the custody, charge or care of the child although in some cases a court order could be involved.</P>
      <P>I undertook on Committee Stage to take a further look at this amendment before Report Stage. It is possibly the only issue on which I gave such an undertaking where I am not proposing an official response. The reason is that I am not convinced the amendment is an improvement on the wording and definition in the Bill. It could lead to some confusion as to what length is a reasonable time on occasions when time is important. It also raises questions as to what would happen if the missing parent is located. It cannot be assumed that the missing parent abandoned his or her family. It also cannot be assumed that the family want the missing parent back in their lives. Family distress and dissension would follow.</P>
      <P>In other words, the amendment would replace a straightforward provision with a complicated proposal that could have many different outcomes. It will also be noted that paragraph (<i>c</i>) provides for both parents in every case except where one parent has the sole custody, charge or care of the child. This means that in a wide variety of circumstances, where custody is not an issue or where there is joint custody, both parents would have equal responsibilities and duties under the relevant provisions of this legislation. I am not prepared to accept the amendment as it could bring some confusion and dissension into a situation where clarity is essential. Even though it may entail some parents being able to avoid their responsibilities, the greater good is served by acknowledging that may happen.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister has not given greater consideration to this issue. A very common situation is where one parent has sole custody. However, that does not mean the other parent is not involved in the child's life and does not have a right to be consulted and informed, and a right to be considered as a parent. In most cases, the person who has sole custody is the mother. The Bill as currently worded, <Col N="90" /> excludes fathers from the definition of parent in situations where the mother has sole custody and <i>vice versa</i> where the father has sole custody. The former is the more common situation. It indicates a certain mind-set on the part of the drafters of the Bill that simply because one parent has sole custody, the other parent forfeits all his or her rights. It is misguided thinking and I intend to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>There are two things I urge the Minister to consider before the debate takes place in the Seanad. First, as Deputy Shortall says, if one parent gains custody after a marriage breakdown or family dysfunction, it is usually the mother, not the father. What I have to say applies equally in the reverse circumstances. Given that, in most instances, it is the mother and not the father who gains custody, this could lead to difficulties with the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. This provision in the Bill should be proofed in the context of a check being made as to its impact in terms of the Keegan judgment in the European Court. Second, in the context of married couples being joint guardians of their children, this provision could lead to constitutional difficulties.</P>

      <P>I remind Deputy Shatter that we are not talking about rights but parents' responsibilities, which is an altogether different matter. Deputy Shortall should be aware that there is no question of there being an exclusion. I am not preventing the other parent from appealing a custody decision in court, quite the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the present wording, only the parent who has the sole custody, charge or care of the child is covered in the definition. I agree with the point made by Deputy Shatter and remind the Minister of the provision of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child stipulating that children have a right to know and be cared for by both parents. In instances where there is sole custody, the Minister is seeking to exclude the other parent in terms of rights and responsibilities.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 20, to delete lines 1 to 5 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Any recommendations made by a family welfare conference shall be agreed unanimously by those present at the con<Col N="91" /> ference, unless the disagreement of any person present is regarded by the coordinator as unreasonable, in which case the coordinator may dispense with that person's agreement.</P>
    <P>(3) Where any such recommendations are not agreed unanimously (disregarding any disagreement mentioned in <i>subsection (2)</i>), the matter shall be referred to the health board for determination.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the family welfare conference, as established in the Bill, is to empower families to find solutions to the problems that have led to the child's being vulnerable. The emphasis is on agencies and the families working collaboratively. This emphasis on partnership signals a change from the traditional practice of State intervention in the lives of families experiencing difficulties to an approach that is consensus-based. The evaluation of the family group conference pilot project conducted in the East Coast Area Health Board highlighted that the principle of partnership and the value of collaboration were indispensable elements to the conference on good practice.</P>
    <P>Research on the evaluation has shown that, given the mechanisms, extended families are capable of making effective decisions about their children's lives. In over 90% of conferences, agreement was reached on the family plans. For these plans to be viable, they need to be based on a consensus view of those attending the conference, including the professionals, on what is in the best interest of the child. It is one of the fundamental principles of the family welfare conferences that, in so far as is possible, agreement should be unanimous. However, it was suggested on Committee Stage that the existing provision was too restrictive and that it could give rise to deliberately obstructive persons undermining the conference. Therefore, amendment No. 8 states that the agreements should be unanimous in so far as this is possible, and where a person is being unreasonable, the co-ordinator may dispense with that person's views. The amendment is similar to the provisions governing conferences in Part 4 of the Bill. This is a better approach to the one advocated by Deputy Shatter because it makes clear that it is the responsibility of the co-ordinator to determine whether a person's views should be dispensed with. Therefore, amendment No. 8 is to be recommended and amendment No. 9 rejected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief. The issue I was concerned about in this section was that, as the Bill stood, any recommendation made by a family welfare conference had to be agreed unanimously by those present for progress to be made. Cases could arise in which someone might be behaving so unreasonably that his or her objections should not be regarded as vetoing progress being made on the child's welfare. The Minister is addressing the issue slightly differently to the amendment <Col N="92" /> that I proposed. The Minister's amendment improves the Bill but addresses it in a way that causes concern. I will not press amendment No. 9.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) the legal representatives, if any, of the child,</P>
      <P>(<i>e</i>) the legal representative, if any, of the parents or guardian of the child,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 relates to the persons entitled to attend a family welfare conference. This was discussed on Committee Stage, but it is sufficiently important to discuss in this House on Report Stage. Under the terms of section 9, a variety of different people are entitled to attend a family welfare conference. Under subsection (<i>f</i>), the co-ordinator can allow other persons to attend whom he believes, after consultation with child and the parents or guardians, might make a positive contribution to the conference, either because of the person's knowledge of the child or its family or because of the person's expertise.</P>
      <P>The intention of a family welfare conference is to design, by agreement, a family plan for dealing with problems relating to an individual child. If it does not work out, the case may go to court. I am concerned that matters could arise that would require that the legal representatives of the child or parents be available to furnish legal advice concerning issues under discussion and proposals that are being made. A lawyer with expertise in the law on children and child care services would have something positive to contribute. He or she, with the trust of the family, parents, child, or both, might be able to point out what might pertain if what was proposed in the family welfare conference was not advanced and what the alternatives are. This could be done in a manner that others in the family welfare conference might be able to achieve. I am concerned that if parents or a child do not have a legal right to have a legal representative present, it will rarely take place arising from discretion. Again, we could find ourselves in constitutional difficulties or in difficulties with the Convention of Human Rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are replicas of the amendments tabled by Deputy Shatter on Committee Stage. The Minister for Health and Children opposed them then and I cannot recommend them now. They are at odds with the purpose and ethos to the family welfare con<Col N="93" /> ference. As I have pointed out in respect of the Deputy's previous amendment, the purpose of the family welfare conference is to produce a plan for the future care, protection and development of the child. A vital aspect of the process is that the family takes responsibility for the child and comes up with proposals for the plan with whatever assistance they need from the professionals attending the conference. The experience gained in the pilot project in the East Coast Area Health Board would suggest that, with the procedures followed for all family conferences, it is important to have as informal an atmosphere as is reasonably possible. This is to give the family the opportunity to discuss and develop a plan to which they can commit themselves and which is in the interest of the child. This objective cannot be served by introducing the formality of having legal representatives there as of right.</P>
      <P>In convening a conference a co-ordinator will, in accordance with good practice, discuss with all the parties the persons it would be most appropriate to invite to participate. If the child or the family insist that their legal representative be present, it will be open to the co-ordinator to invite that representative under section 9(1)(<i>f</i>) on the basis that they would make a positive contribution because of their expertise. However, a conference held under these circumstances is unlikely to be very successful. In relation to the proposed amendment to section 12, the same principle applies.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Shatter indicated there might be reasons under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights which would make it necessary to provide for the statutory right of the legal representative of a child and his or her family to attend a family conference and he expressed the same view today. In the light of the Deputy's concerns, the Minister of State with responsibility for children checked the position with the Attorney General's office, particularly in view of the proposals to assimilate the European convention into Irish law. In the view of that office, any question of a child's constitutional rights or his or her rights under the European convention does not arise. Article 6(1) of the convention provides that in the determination of civil rights and obligations on any criminal charge, every person is entitled to a fair and public hearing. As regards a criminal charge, if a charge is in any way serious, this undoubtedly includes the right to legal representation. As regards a civil claim, Article 6 clearly guarantees the right of access to the courts which may well include the right to legal representation and, in certain circumstances, the right to legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 38 of the Constitution provides that no person can be tried on a criminal charge, save in the due course of law. The courts have interpreted this in a manner which is similar to the interpretations put by the European Court on Article 6 of the convention, that is, in any criminal charge where the accused faces the possibility <Col N="94" /> of serious penalty, the Constitution requires that the person be informed of his or her right to legal representation.</P>
    <P>As regards civil cases, although there is an automatic right of access to the courts, the Irish courts so far have not found there is any automatic right to legal representation or legal aid. However, the Attorney General's office has indicated that in its view a family welfare conference is not analogous to either a civil or a criminal trial as it is explicitly intended to be a non-judicial process for children in need of care and protection. The Attorney General's office concurs with the view expressed on Committee Stage that if legal representation was considered necessary or desirable, section 9(1) is sufficient to deal with the matter. The question of accepting or rejecting Deputy Shatter's amendment is therefore a policy issue. I have already stated policy reasons for not accepting the amendments and, therefore, recommend to the House that they be rejected.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where a health board decides not to apply for an order under this Part following receipt by it of a request from a child's parent or guardian that it does so, or unreasonably delays in making such application, the parent or guardian may make application to the court under this Part.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes the insertion of a new subsection in section 16 of the Bill and what will be the new section 23A to be inserted in the Child Care Act, 1991. As the Ceann Comhairle stated, amendments Nos. 13 and 16 are consequential on this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 is one of the more important amendments tabled in the context of <Col N="95" /> the Bill. Part 3, to which I referred earlier, seeks to put in place a new tranche of provisions in the Child Care Act, 1991, to deal with children in need of special care or protection. It provides, under the new section 23A to be inserted in the 1991 Act, that where it appears to a health board with respect to a child who resides or is found in its area that the child requires special care or protection which he or she is unlikely to receive unless a court makes an order under this Part in respect of the child, it shall be the duty of the health board to apply for whichever of the various orders this new Part prescribes as appropriate in the particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>The new section also contains other provisions relating to the convening of family welfare conferences and deals with whether, at the conclusion of a conference, a health board proposes to apply for a special care order in respect of a child. Subsection (3) states that where a parent or guardian of a child requests a health board to apply for a special care order in respect of a child and the board decides not to do so, it shall inform the parents in writing of the reasons for this.</P>
    <P>It is important to summarise the matters with which this provision is concerned because the amendment I have tabled would otherwise not make sense. Where parents believe there is a need for a special care order in relation to their child &ndash; even if the health board has not taken initial action &ndash; they can ask the health board to take action. The health board must then consider whether to apply for a special care order and, thereafter, will decide either to do so and initiate court proceedings or will not do so and inform the parents of that fact. The legislation is defective in this context because it does not envisage that where a health board decides not to apply for a special care order, the parents can apply for such an order. It also fails to envisage that where parents ask a health board to make an application and, following the passage of many months, no such application is made, the parents can then make the application.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall quite correctly referred, in the context of children at risk, to the huge backlog of cases involving children within one health board area, approximately 200 of whom have been designated as being at genuine risk and needing assessment and, possibly, intervention under the 1991 Act. These children's cases have not been comprehensively examined. There are hundreds of other children about whom concerns have been notified to the health board, but who are not on the so-called priority list and whose cases are not being investigated as a result.</P>
    <P>I can envisage teenage children, whose parents find themselves incapable of dealing with, creating mayhem at home because they suffer from particular personality or other disorders or difficulties. I foresee instances where those parents will approach their health board and state that they require a special care order to be made for the protection not only of themselves, but also <Col N="96" /> of the other children in the family home. The health board will then place their application on a list and perhaps two years later making a decision either to apply or not to do so. In the meantime, the legislation does not envisage a situation where parents, either singly or together, can make an application. The health board may decide, for budgetary reasons, not to make an application. It may do so because the decision is correct or, alternatively, because someone has made a wrong judgment in relation to the problems that arise in respect of a particular child or the difficulties from which that child suffers.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the reason the legislation does not envisage the health boards making an application, other than there being budgetary considerations involved. This is designed to ensure health boards are not compelled, within a particular period, to make a decision on a parent's application for a special care order and that health boards control the number of such applications made, regardless of the circumstances in which children find themselves. The only reason Part 3 is included in the Bill is because of the law case in which a decision was made by Mr. Justice Geoghegan in 1995 about a child in need of special care and also on foot of the series of cases, to which I referred earlier and which were dealt with by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly and other High Court judges, that illustrate the existence of a lacuna, a huge gap, in child care legislation. A substantial number of these court applications are made by parents on behalf of their children with difficulties and for whom the parents are incapable of caring. The courts have decided they have a constitutional jurisdiction to deal with these applications. The Minister in the legislation is trying to ensure these applications are made at District Court level and only by health boards. He is making a huge mistake and not dealing with the issue in a manner which protects the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>If Part 3 is enacted in its current form, what will be the consequences? I know what they will be. While Part 3 will be invoked occasionally by health boards in District Court proceedings, putting the Part in place will not deprive the High Court of the constitutional jurisdiction it has exercised and developed in this area since 1995. Parents may not bother asking health boards to initiate this type of application. The procedure we see on a daily basis in the High Court in front of Mr. Justice Peter Kelly will continue because we cannot legislatively curtail the constitutional obligations imposed on the courts to protect the welfare of children and the constitutional rights of the courts to deal with the type of circumstances that have arisen. Where parents apply to health boards and there is an undue delay on the part of the boards, the parents will go back to the courts.</P>
    <P>The further and ultimate difficulty which will arise is that, if and when the Government finally brings Part 3 into force and if a parent, instead of asking the health board to make such an order, goes straight to the High Court, instead of the <Col N="97" /> High Court dealing with the specific needs of the child in question, we will end up with a technical set of High Court and Supreme Court proceedings which will be concerned with whether the High Court should still exercise this constitutional jurisdiction in circumstances where the Oireachtas has filled the gap by putting in place statutory provisions. This will result in a plethora of complex cases with unnecessarily large amounts of legal costs incurred dealing with issues of a technical and legal nature which do not address the specific circumstances of the individual children about whom we should have concern.</P>
    <P>If we are interested in protecting the welfare of children, if there is a child in need of special care or protection whose parents will go the High Court route and if the Minister wants Part 3 to replace the High Court and put in place a coherent body of law to be administered at District Court level to fill the gap, it is essential the amendments I have tabled to Part 3 are taken on board. I urge the Minister to do so.</P>

      <P>As all these amendments address the same issue and are identical to ones tabled by the Deputy on Committee Stage, I cannot recommend to the House that they be accepted.</P>
      <P>It is proposed under this Part that the courts will be able to grant health boards the power to detain a child in a special care unit where his or her behaviour is such that it poses a real and substantial threat to his or her health, safety, development or welfare and he or she is in need of special care and protection. These children by definition will not be the subject of criminal proceedings and, therefore, not have the same protection as children before the courts on criminal charges.</P>
      <P>It is a serious decision to detain a child and the philosophy of the Bill is that the application for a special care order and the detention of children in special care units should only be used as a last resort when all other options have been explored and found not feasible. For this reason, the Government has built in a number of checks and balances to the system to ensure this will be the case.</P>
      <P>A health board, before applying for an order, must arrange for the convening of a family welfare conference. When the conference has completed its deliberations and it is still proposed to apply for a special care order, the views of the Special Residential Services Board, established in Part 11, must be sought. Where a health board seeks an interim care order, it must be about to arrange a family welfare conference, one must be in place or the board must be in the process of seeking the views of the Special Residential Services Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These checks and balances are critically important, not only to ensure the appropriate services are provided for the child, but also to protect his or her civil rights. If the amendments pro<Col N="98" /> posed by the Deputy were accepted, the checks and balances it is proposed to put in place could be bypassed by the parents or guardians applying for a special care order or interim special care order. The application for such an order is such a serious step that it is appropriate that only health boards, the statutory bodies with responsibility for promoting the welfare of children at risk, should make the final decision as to whether such an application should be made.</P>

      <P>The Minister's last comment discloses the extent to which he does not understand the difficulty in this area. The way he phrased it is disparaging of parents. The idea is that parents who have problems with a child would take the liberty of going to the courts to ask them to find adequate facilities in which their children would be cared for in circumstances where the parents are at the end of their tether and the statutory bodies are not doing the job. That is an extraordinary attitude.</P>
      <P>It is clear from what the Minister said that no serious consideration has been given to what will happen in the context of the current jurisdiction exercised by the High Court. It is also clear the Minister has not addressed what the position might be of either a child in serious difficulty or parents having serious difficulties with such a child where a health board does not respond or fails to respond within a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not only missed the point, but is putting in place an entirely new section in the Child Care Act, 1991, which does not address fully the area he said he intended to address. He is leaving a huge gap in the legal procedures available. Two jurisdictions will operate concurrently. One will be a High Court constitutional jurisdiction and the other will be a District Court jurisdiction. The Minister does not pay any heed to the fact that, on occasions, health boards do not respond in time. In the context of the Government's term in office, health boards have not been equipped to respond in sufficient time to concerns about children at risk. This is an ongoing problem and difficulty, of which the Minister is aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot stop parents making applications to courts in the interests of their children. <Col N="99" /> He seems to think that hundreds of parents want to rush to the courts simply to get rid of their children and place them in some form of residential care. It is a serious issue and I have never met a parent who wanted to have his or her child placed in care in circumstances where there are not huge family problems and difficulties. The High Court cases we have witnessed have related to children whose parents have found themselves incapable of caring for them or to children with major personal difficulties who are at serious risk of living very short lives if their difficulties are not addressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> I regret that the Minister is not accepting this amendment. He will live to rue this day. In the context of the Minister's responses to amendments to this Bill, this is one of the biggest mistakes he has made. I say this with no sense of satisfaction because I am concerned about the welfare of children and with addressing the issues which have been exposed through the courts for six years.</P>

      <P>Section 23B(5) imposes on health boards the obligation to go back to the court and seek a discharge of the special care order in respect of a child where the circumstances which led to the making of the order no longer obtain. Under the amendment a parent or guardian would also be able to apply for a discharge of the order. It would be inappropriate to include the amendment in this subsection.</P>
      <P>The subsection clearly relates the obligations of the health boards in the context of their powers and obligations in regard to special care orders as set out in the section. It is the responsibility of the health board to provide or to arrange to provide the appropriate services and necessary special care and protection for children in special care units. The health boards, therefore, are the bodies which are in the best position to determine if the circumstances which gave rise to the order in the first place have ceased to exist.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that it should remain the obligation of the health boards to seek a discharge under these circumstances and that the obligation should not be imposed on parents or guardians. Deputies may be concerned about the rights of parents or guardians in these circumstances. These are properly addressed in section 23F which allows a court on its own motion or the application of any person to vary or discharge a special care order. This will allow a parent or guardian to seek a discharge of a special care order. These points were made by the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, on Committee Stage and Deputy Shatter was happy that the issue was addressed by section 23F and withdrew his amendments. I, therefore, recommend to the House that the amendments be rejected.</P>

I made the case on Committee Stage that the legislation should be child-centred and, therefore, the words &ldquo;the interests of justice&rdquo; should be deleted because I found it difficult to understand how the interests of justice could be served if they did not coincide with the welfare of the child .

      <P>The Deputy tabled the same amendment on Committee Stage and I cannot recommend it to the House. As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, pointed out at the time, the provisions of the Bill in regard to private foster care are intended to update the legislation on this matter. It is intended to ensure, whether there is a reward, the health board should be notified of a private foster care arrangement. The effect of the Deputy's amendment would be that only arrangements made for reward would be governed by the legislation. On Committee Stage it was pointed out that there would be considerable difficulty in defining whether the arrangement was for reward where payments of any sort, for instance, expenses, were made. The Deputy pointed out that there are circumstances in which children are placed with friends of the family and the definition might encompass them.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, agreed to examine the matter again and arising from her review I have tabled amendments Nos. 19, 20 and 21 to deal with the point raised by Deputy Shatter, as his amendment would make the exclusions from the definition of a &ldquo;private foster care arrangement&rdquo; too wide.

      <P>&ldquo;23R. (1) Any person arranging or undertaking a private foster care arrangement in respect of a child shall regard the child's welfare as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
      <P>(2) Any person undertaking such an arrangement shall take all reasonable measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of the child concerned.</P>
      <P>(3) Any person arranging such an arrangement shall make all reasonable enquiries to ensure that the person undertaking it is in a position to comply with subsection (2).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Government amendments are in response to the proposal to amend section 23R whereby an additional duty to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration was imposed on those involved in private foster care arrangements. Under section 23R it was the duty of any person arranging or undertaking a private foster care arrangement in respect of a child to take all reasonable measures to safeguard the child's health, safety and welfare. The difficulty with accepting that amendment, which has been tabled again, was that under section 23W(1)(<i>b</i>) it was an offence to contravene section 23R.</P>
      <P>Legal advice indicated that the existing provision provided reasonably objective criteria on which to initiate a prosecution. If the amendment were accepted and the prosecution was initiated, it would require establishing that the accused did not regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. It has been suggested that it would be difficult to establish such a case and also that the original wording was flawed as it would not be reasonable to impose an obligation on a person arranging a foster care arrangement to take all reasonable measures to safeguard the child's health, safety and welfare as they would not have day to day care of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, to impose an obligation on them to make all reasonable inquiries to ensure the person undertaking the arrangement is capable of meeting this obligation. Amendment No. 30 is a technical amendment following on from amendment No. 23. These amendments are designed to accommodate the <Col N="105" /> Opposition proposal while ensuring it does not weaken the section regarding offences. I, therefore, commend to the House that amendments No. 23 and 30 be accepted and amendment No. 24 be rejected.</P>

      <P>This provision deals with the institution of proceedings by health boards where the health board believes that a person arranging or undertaking a private care arrangement has not notified it or the person is not taking all reasonable measures to safeguard the health and welfare of the child concerned. It goes on to provide that application may be made to the District Court for a number of orders. The amendment is designed to ensure the person or persons who make the foster care arrangement and the persons undertaking such an arrangement would co-operate in carrying out an assessment of whether it is in the interests of a child that the arrangement should continue or be terminated.

      <P>I cannot recommend that this amendment be accepted. The purpose of section 23U(<i>b</i>) is to allow the health boards to apply to the court for any one of a number of remedies where the health board is of the opinion that a person has made or undertaken a private foster care arrangement without notifying the board or is not taking all reasonable steps to ensure the child's health, safety and welfare are taken care of. These remedies are that the board may obtain from the District Court under the Child Care Act, 1991, a supervision order, an emergency care order, an interim care order or a care order. Alternatively, the board can apply to have the arrangement terminated and the child returned to his or her parents or guardian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> Under the Deputy's amendment it is proposed to add a further option for a health board to apply for an order obliging the persons concerned and the health boards to co-operate in assessing whether it is in the interests of the child to continue or to terminate the arrangement. It seems impossible to have a court order making someone co-operate on a matter. As I have already indicated, the amendment has been inserted in the Child Care Act, 1991, and is therefore governed by the principles set out in section 3 of that Act. It would, therefore, always be an obligation on the health board to act in a manner that regards the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration, having regard to the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise. If a health board considers it appropriate to monitor and supervise the situation voluntarily, in co-operation with the private foster carers, it is open to it to make that arrangement without recourse to the courts. This, as the Deputy is aware, is the situation in relation to many vulnerable children where the health board works with the families to ensure their protection without taking the child into care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

      <P>The essential purpose of this provision is to deal with a situation where a foster care arrangement has been undertaken which has not been notified under the Act. This is not to deal with a situation where a person is not taking all reasonable measures to safeguard the health of a child. Under section 23U, if a health board believes that a person who is arranging or undertaking a private foster care arrangement has not made the appropriate notifications, there is an obligation imposed on the health board to make a District Court application. The District Court can do only one of three things. It can make a supervision order, an order that the child be taken into care or an order that the arrangement be terminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a possibility that a child could be placed with a couple or an individual by way of a private foster care arrangement without the persons concerned realising the legal provisions and obligations to notify. Where notification does not take place, it seems that even where the child is getting on well with the foster parents and its welfare indicates that it should stay with the foster parents, the options available to the health board relate to the making of supervision orders or the child being taken into care or returned to its original home. This provision, as proposed, is designed to ensure that where a foster care arrangement is in place which has not been notified, the persons who made the foster care arrangement and the persons undertaking it would co-operate with the health board in carrying out an assessment of whether it is in the interests of the child's welfare that the arrangement continues. This is to ensure they would both be compelled to co-operate. If the health board reaches a conclusion that it is in the interests of the child's welfare that the arrangement con<Col N="107" /> tinues, there would be no need for it to go to court, to make a supervision order, to take the child into care or to terminate the arrangement.</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to do what the Minister said, namely, to protect the welfare of the child. It would provide an additional alternative in the context of those who may inadvertently fail to notify because they are not aware of what the law states. Many people in the future will have children placed with them by neighbours, friends or relations and they will not know the legal position. The children may stay with them for a longer period than was originally anticipated. There is no reason people in such circumstances should find themselves caught up in District Court proceedings where a child's welfare indicates that the arrangements informally put in place should continue.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that because the section appears to envisage the three types of interventions listed, to which I have already referred, health boards, as a matter of practice, will operate those interventions and take the view that where there is such a private arrangement which has not been notified to them within the timeframe in which it should be notified and where assessments have not been carried out, they should automatically move to look for a supervision order, to take the child into care or to terminate an arrangement. This is designed to ensure the health boards would not fall into the trap of dealing with this type of problem in this way. In that context, I fail to understand the reason the Minister will not take on board my amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26: </P>
      <P>In page 32, line 50, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is important. Unfortunately, we are coming back to issues we dealt with on Committee Stage and which I hoped the Minister would be willing to address. It relates to circumstances where people are acting as foster parents. The legislation provides that a person shall not arrange or undertake a private foster care arrangement for the purpose of adopting a child under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1998. It also states that any person &ldquo;undertaking a private foster care arrangement in respect of a child shall <Col N="108" /> not apply under those Acts to adopt the child unless the child is eligible for adoption under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1998, and the relevant health board has consented to the continuance of the arrangement pending the completion of an assessment of that person under those Acts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I made the case on Committee Stage that, as matters stand, if a child has been in the care of foster parents for a period in excess of 12 months, under the Adoption Act, 1988, they can make application for an adoption order under the procedures prescribed by that Act. In practice, foster parents have rarely, if ever, done this after a child has been in their care for only 12 months. What usually happens is that if a child has been in the care of foster parents for six, seven or eight years and there is no realistic possibility of the child resuming a relationship with its natural parents and living at home with them, foster parents seek to invoke the provisions of the 1988 Act. I am not aware of any difficulty in the context of foster parents invoking the provisions of the 1988 Act prematurely in circumstances which are contrary to the welfare of the child. I am aware of many situations which arise where a child may be better off with an adoption order being made to secure their position with the foster parents after being in the foster parents' care for many years and of the problems that arise because of the restrictive nature of current legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Bill seeks to diminish the current entitlements of foster parents to make application under the 1988 Act. It provides that if a foster parent wishes to apply for adoption, he or she cannot do so without getting prior consent from the health board. I do not know the reason the Minister is introducing this restriction in the legislation.</P>
    <P>If a health board does not co-operate and tells a foster parent that it will not consent to the fostering arrangement continuing if he or she applies to adopt, it will place some foster parents in great difficulty. On occasions health boards and social workers reach conclusions about child welfare that appear odd to those of us who have received the training of a social worker. There may well be occasions where foster parents wish to adopt a child and the health board is not willing to consent to the fostering arrangement continuing for a variety of reasons.</P>
    <P>The key amendment that I propose, amendment No. 28, which we are discussing in conjunction with the earlier amendment No. 26, reads as follows:</P>
    <P>In page 33, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) A health board shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to the continuation of a private foster care arrangement as referred to in paragraph (f2&gt;b) of subsection (2) and, in particular, such consent shall not be withheld solely because a foster parent applies under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1998, to adopt a child in his or her care.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> I draw the attention of the House to the report published yesterday by the working group on foster care which contains a broad range of recommendations. In the context of adoption options for children in care, the report states on page 42:</P>
    <P>The working group is very concerned about the very high proportion of children in care for a period of two years or more and a number of submissions to the working group identified the issue of allowing for adoption of children in long-term foster care. Adoption of children in care is a very complicated issue involving complex legal and constitutional issues regarding the rights of parents and children. These issues must be considered in the context of protections afforded to the family in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It goes on deal with the law as currently framed and states:</P>
    <P>The working group is concerned that some children remain in long-term foster care when adoption may in fact be in their best interests. The working group recommends that health boards actively consider the option of adoption in the best interests of the individual child for all children in long-term foster care.</P>
    <P>I am unaware of any difficulty arising from the operation of the 1988 Act in the context of foster parents using it to seek an adoption order. Why should we introduce in this Bill an additional veto that the health board can exercise if there is not a single example of a case which indicates a need for this type of veto?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments were already tabled by the Deputy on Committee Stage and rejected by vote of the committee. I cannot, therefore, recommend to the House that any of them should be adopted. Amendment No. 26 is a technical amendment depending on the acceptance of amendment No. 27. The purpose of section 23V is to inhibit people from using the mechanism of private foster care to circumvent adoption procedures under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1998. Under section 23V(1) arranging or undertaking a private foster care arrangement for the purpose of adopting a child is prohibited.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) is designed to accommodate bona fide circumstances where the child is in private foster care and a genuine relationship has developed between the foster carers and the child. It allows carers to apply to adopt the child subject to the condition that the child is eligible. Under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1998, the prospective carers will also have to undergo an assessment. Subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) allows the private foster care arrangement to continue pending the completion of the assessment if the health board consents. This is an important protection for the child and if this section was deleted it would undermine that protection and the intent of subsections (1) and (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies raised a number of issues concerning <Col N="110" /> this section on Committee Stage. There were some views expressed that health boards would use this provision as a veto against the processing of adoption applications under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1998. As my colleague indicated on Committee Stage, this part is an amendment to the Child Care Act, 1991. The provisions are, therefore, governed by section 3 of that Act which obliges the health boards, having regard to the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise, to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. The boards will, therefore, have to act in the best interests of the child at all times when making any decisions as to whether to leave the child with the foster carers.</P>
    <P>It was also pointed out that inter-country adoptions, the main issue affected by this section, are now operated in accordance with the standardised framework for inter-country adoption assessment. Some Deputies also raised the question of the implications for relatives intending to adopt. The definition in section 23O excludes relatives from the scope of these provisions. Given these checks and balances in relation to the health boards and their dealings with this matter, I consider the amendment totally unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 29 is a further amendment to section 23D. The purpose of that section and subsection (3) is to allow the health boards to apply to the court for any one of a number of remedies where the health board is of the opinion that a person has contravened subsections (1) or (2) of this section. These remedies are that the board obtain, under the Child Care Act, 1991, either an emergency care order, an interim care order or a care order. Alternatively the health board can apply to have the arrangement terminated and the child returned to his or her parents or guardian.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out before, this part has been deliberately incorporated into the 1991 Act so as to ensure all the legal protections for children apply to this part. This part is, therefore, not designed to reinvent the child care legislation. As the entire part is built on the existing legislation, no new procedures are being proposed in relation to the provisions governing taking children into care.</P>
    <P>The effect of the proposed amendment would be that in all cases under section 23B where a health board sought a District Court order under this subsection, the person arranging or undertaking the private foster care arrangement must be notified and given an opportunity to give evidence. This would mean that in the circumstances that a health board applied for an emergency care order, the court's power to grant such an order would be constricted by the need to hear the evidence of the party who may potentially be the person who created the circumstances in which the order is being sought in the first place. This could have the effect of prejudicing the use of section 13 of the principal Act in the circumstances envisaged in the section.</P>
    <P>Any issues of natural justice in relation to cir<Col N="111" /> cumstances envisaged in the section can be dealt with by the provisions in section 14 which determines the notification to be given by health boards when a child is placed in care under an emergency care order and section 17(3) which addresses the issue in relation to interim care orders and the current provision in relation to care orders. It should be noted that under section 22 of the Child Care Act a court may, on its own motion or on the application of any person, vary or discharge a carer supervision order or condition attached to it.</P>
    <P>For the reasons outlined, I recommend that the House rejects amendments Nos. 26 to 29, inclusive.</P>

      <P>The first of these amendments in my name, No. 32, arises from an amendment put down by Deputy Shatter on Committee Stage and again submitted today as amendment No. 31. It ensures that before a child admits to an offence as a condition to being considered for admission to the diversion programme, the child must have had reasonable opportunity to talk to his or her parents or guardian and to have obtained legal advice, where sought.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter's amendment did not conflict with the policy underpinning the Bill, in particular the consideration that would apply before a child is admitted to the diversion programme. I promised to consult the Parliamentary Counsel about the wording. The outcome of those consultations is the two amendments I am now happy to propose which fully meet the objectives of the Committee Stage amendment.</P>
      <P>The second amendment, No. 49, is proposed for consistency. It deals with the situation where a child is before the court charged with an offence and the court is considering whether to direct the probation service to convene a family conference. In such cases, the child would also have had to admit to the offence. I thank Deputy Shatter for raising the matter in the first place during Committee Stage and I recommend amendments Nos. 32 and 49 to the House.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) admission to the Programme is in the best interests of the child,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 33 relates to admission to the diversion programme, to which the Minister referred. Section 23(1) provides that the child may be admitted to the programme if he or she (<i>a</i>) accepts responsibility for his or her criminal behaviour; (<i>b</i>) consents to be cautioned and, where appropriate, to be supervised by a juvenile liaison officer; and (<i>c</i>) is of or over the age of criminal responsibility and under 18 years of age.

      <P>In previous comments the Minister indicated that the concern in this legislation relates to protecting, in so far as they can be protected, the best interests of the child.

      <P>Amendment No. 34 arises out of an amendment put down by Deputy Shatter on Committee Stage and resubmitted today. I had reservations on the Committee Stage amendment as it did not seem to adequately recognise the complex interaction of the interests of young offenders and the interests of society, and any victims of offences committed by young persons. However, I undertook to examine section 23 to see if the point raised on Committee Stage could be accommodated in the section, and the amendment I am now happy to propose represents the outcome of that examination.</P>
      <P>Section 23(2) will now place an onus on the director of the diversion programme to be satisfied that admission to the programme would be in the best interests of the child as long as those interests did not conflict with the interests of society and any victim. This formula meets the point made by Deputy Shatter and protects the interests of society and any victim.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 27 specifies the length of the supervisory periods associated with the different types of caution. A formal caution entails a 12 months supervisory period. The amendment seeks to change that to between six and 24 months.</P>
      <P>In preparing this section, we decided to follow the 1996 Bill in that respect by giving effect to present administrative practice. We did this in the knowledge that the Garda national juvenile office considers it to be the appropriate period of supervision and, as with other aspects of the diversion programme, it works and has been seen to work.</P>
      <P>I have been careful with the Bill not to be over-prescriptive. Accordingly, it will be noted that the 12 months period can be varied by the director in accordance with any ministerial regulations made under section 47. Also, a family conference can recommend a variation of the period of supervision. Section 38 so provides.</P>
      <P>That brings me to another valid reason for keeping the provision as it is. Section 34 sets a time limit for the holding of a conference under Part IV. It must be held during the period of supervision. That is a sensible provision as once the supervision is finished, the child will no longer be in the diversion programme.</P>
      <P>While I would expect that the majority of conferences would be convened within a few months of the admission to the programme, in some cases a delay might be unavoidable and it would be a pity if in any such case time ran out on the holding of a conference. The 12 months period gives that extra bit of leeway if such an avoidable delay arises.</P>
      <P>In making the case for the current policy on supervision, as reflected in section 27, I am not saying Deputy Shatter does not have an arguable case with his amendment. On balance, however, I would prefer to stay with the current successful practice and, unfortunately, I will not accept his amendment.</P>

I said on Committee Stage that I had no problem with the amendments but that I would like to discuss them from a purely drafting point of view with the Parliamentary Counsel. The outcome is amendments Nos. 36 and 38, which I am happy to commend to the House. I thank Deputy Shatter for bringing the issue to my attention in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 42, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) the undertaking by the child of community services as defined by the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, for <Col N="116" /> a specified number of days over a specified number of weeks for a period of time not exceeding 24 hours in total.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to deal with the action plan that is put in place in relation to a particular child to provide an additional option of what a child can be required to do. There is a whole series of matters detailed in Section 39 (3). This is an amendment in identical terms to an amendment tabled by me on Committee Stage. It was my hope that by tabling it again, I might stimulate the Minister into agreeing to what is contained in it and bringing forward any more detailed amendment that may be required to render it effective.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to propose that among the various options available should include the undertaking by the child of community services as defined by the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, for a specified number of days over a specified number of weeks for a period of time not exceeding 24 hours in total. It was intended that where children commit anti-social acts and they are being dealt with under this Part of the Bill, there would be an additional possibility to require a child to engage in community service where it is appropriate that the child do so. Currently, community service options are confined to persons over 18 years of age and the time has come for us to revise our approach in that regard, and this amendment seeks to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is impossible to accept for technical reasons. The Community Service Act provides for the imposition of community service by the courts, and only by the courts. Community service can only be imposed as an alternative to a custodial sentence on persons who are 16 years of age or over, and a minimum of 40 hours community service is provided for by the 1983 Act.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the amendment envisages community service arising out of an action plan formulated at a Garda conference being imposed on any child from 12 years upwards, and having a minimum number of 24 hours service. In other words, the amendment is in conflict with existing legislation from which it seeks to derive its meaning.</P>
      <P>In pointing out the weaknesses in the amendment I do not wish to prejudice or anticipate the outcome of the examination of the final report of the expert group on the Probation and Welfare Service. I am not arguing against the terms of the amendment, but its conflict with existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to admit that what the amendment seeks to achieve is, in one respect, worth following up. In situations where the court orders the Probation and Welfare Service to convene a family conference and to formulate an action plan, community service could form part of that plan. Accordingly, in accordance with an undertaking I gave on Committee Stage, I have referred the amendment to the officials examining the final <Col N="117" /> report of the expert group. I regret that I cannot accept the amendment, but I am having it followed up in the context of the examination of the final report of the expert group on the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 44, line 7, after &ldquo;Garda Síochána&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the remaining two shall not be members of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is in response to an amendment tabled by Deputy Shortall on Committee Stage which sought to include one non-Garda person on the committee which will monitor the effectiveness of the diversion programme. The Deputy's amendment, which arose out of a misreading of section 44, would have provided for one person who will not be a garda to be on the committee. The section provides for two members who will not be gardaí, but I admit that this may not have been clear from the original drafting. My amendment will make my intentions in this regard clear and I commend it to the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shortall has resubmitted her amendment, presumably because it specified that the member of the committee who will not be a garda shall have a background in child welfare. This would be inappropriate. The committee members will monitor the effectiveness of the diversion programme, probably with an emphasis on the new aspects, such as restorative conferencing and restorative cautioning. They will review all aspects of its operation and monitor the ongoing training needs of facilitators.</P>
      <P>The skills required for these purposes are not necessarily a background in child welfare, at least not in any narrow meaning of that expression. Instead, a background in juvenile justice, a knowledge of criminology or child psychology or an expertise in mediation or other forms of training could be more appropriate. The programme, after all, is an integral part of the juvenile system and not the child welfare system.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances it is deemed appropriate not to be specific about the qualifications of the members of the committee who are not gardaí, but to let time and experience determine the expertise required. Therefore, I cannot accept Deputy Shortall's amendment, but I hope she will accept that I have come a long way.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's clarification as the original wording was not clear and allowed for all four members of the committee to be gardaí. The Minister makes the point that my <Col N="118" /> amendment could exclude people who would have much to contribute to the monitoring group. He listed a number of people and there is no doubt that such people would make a contribution. However, the Minister has left the wording so loose that there is no requirement for the additional members to have any expertise regarding children or juvenile justice. That is a mistake. Many people with expertise in a wide range of areas know nothing about children or the welfare of children. It is important that the best people sit on the committee. Such people should have relevant experience and expertise. This is a missed opportunity.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 51, line 12, after &ldquo;station&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, but where the child nominates a particular adult, the member in charge shall have regard to that nomination in exercising his or her functions under this subsection&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment concerns the interviewing of children in Garda stations and provides for a situation in which a parent or guardian is not in a position to attend. I am proposing that, where a child nominates a particular adult, the garda in charge in the station shall have regard to that nomination in exercising his or her functions under this subsection.</P>
      <P>In the case of many children likely to come before the courts, or to be in trouble with the law, there may be an unusual situation at home where the parents may not be on the scene and there may not be any legal guardian. A child in such circumstances may have a relationship or rapport with a particular significant adult in his or her life, such as a teacher, neighbour or relative. It is in the child's interest that this person should attend when the child is being interviewed in a Garda station.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the child should have a veto over who would be selected, but that in deciding who should be present while the child is being interviewed, the garda should have regard to the child's request. This is a reasonable proposal if we are to consider the provisions of the UN convention on the rights of the child and the right of the child to be heard. The Minister of State talks much about this issue and the need to listen to children and their needs and desires. In light of this fact, the garda in charge should have regard to the child's wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is unnecessary as it assumes the garda in charge of <Col N="119" /> a Garda station has discretion over whether an adult, reasonably named by the child to attend at the station, is acceptable to that member. Section 58 sets out the circumstances under which the member in charge is obliged to inform the child of his or her right to have an adult advised of the arrest and to have that adult requested to attend at the station. Those circumstances are that the parents or guardian could not be found, or if found, would not, or could not, go to the station.</P>
      <P>Section 61 deals with the interviewing of the child. If a parent or guardian is present, they have a right to attend, subject to subsections (2) and (3). Subsection (7) defines parent or guardian for the purposes of section 61 as including the adult reasonably named by the child, pursuant to section 58. In the absence of the parent or guardian, or the other adult named by the child, the member in charge can nominate another adult.</P>
      <P>This amendment concerns the adult named by the child in the absence of the parent or guardian. The position of that adult would be little different from that of a parent or guardian. This is one of the reasons for section 61(7) which defines parent or guardian as including an adult reasonably named by the child.</P>
      <P>What does &ldquo;reasonably named&rdquo; mean? There is little difference from section 58(2)(f2&gt;a)(ii) which deals with the situation in which a parent or guardian will not, or cannot, attend at a station within a reasonable time. If, for example, the adult named by the child lives 100 miles away or cannot be contacted, he or she has not been reasonably named. If the adult is suspected of complicity in the offence, or is deemed likely to obstruct the course of justice, he or she can be excluded in the same way as a parent or a guardian.</P>
      <P>The wording of this amendment appears to presume that the member in charge has wide discretion in deciding whether to allow the adult named by the child to attend the interview. There is no such wide discretion. The position of the adult is little different from that of a parent or guardian, if present. The amendment is unnecessary and could give a misleading impression. It could be argued that the wording of the amendment where it states that the member in charge shall have regard to the nomination of a particular adult by the child, provides less of a protection for the child than the obligation on that member already included in the Bill which treats the request for an adult to be present in the same way as the request for a parent or guardian.</P>
      <P>Whether the parent or the other adult arrives at the station, they have the same rights and responsibilities. This is one reason it has been possible to provide the definition in section 61(7). For these reasons, the amendment would be unwise and unnecessary and I am not, therefore, in a position to accept it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>In page 51, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall by regulations make provision for the manner in which panels of persons shall be drawn up for the purposes of <i>subsection (1)</i>, and for the functions of such persons.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am dissatisfied with the proposal to guillotine this Bill at 7 p.m. This is a complex and lengthy Bill which required seven sessions on Committee Stage. It is unfair and inappropriate to rush the Bill through in four hours. We will not be able to vote on a number of amendments, let alone debate them. I am particularly concerned about a later amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 44 seeks that the Minister shall by regulations make provision for the manner in which panels of persons shall be drawn up for the purposes of subsection (1) and the functions of such persons. In a particular case related to me recently, a taxi driver who vaguely knew the child in question was called in to the Garda station. It is important that we are clear about the type of people we want to accompany children in interview situations and about their functions. A panel should be created for this purpose. People should not merely be called in to Garda stations to get gardaí out of particular predicaments. The Minister should make regulations to address this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is concerned with the drawing up of panels of persons to attend interviews with children in Garda stations when the parent, guardian or another adult is not available. Technically, I do not believe the amendment achieves its aim in that it presupposes panels will be created; the amendment would only provide for how the panels would be drawn up and what would be their functions. The amendment is also too wide in scope in that in referring to subsection (1) it includes parents or guardians and other adults named by the child who would obviously not be part of any previously drawn up panel.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to section 70, in particular paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) of subsection (1). Paragraph (<i>b</i>) allows the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make regulations governing the role of any of the adults present at the interviewing of children in Garda stations. This important issue equates to the second part of the amendment. Is the adult present to ensure the child is well treated, to ensure procedures are complied with, to offer support or to play a more active role? These are important questions which would have to be teased out in regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>c</i>) of section 70(1) would allow the Minister to make regulations concerning any other matter as may be necessary or expedient for the purposes of allowing Part 6 to have full <Col N="121" /> effect and its due administration. Thus, for example, if the drawing up of panels were considered necessary or expedient for Part 6 to have full effect, this could be achieved in regulations made under section 70.</P>
    <P>At present, where a parent, guardian or other adult named by the child is not available, the Garda will contact a local peace commissioner or other person of stature in the community. In effect, there are informal panels and the system works well. In normal circumstances, no child is questioned in the absence of an adult. As long as I continue to be satisfied that the system works, I would not be in favour of establishing statutory panels. However, if at any time I were to become aware of any shortcomings in the informal system, I would consider using my powers under section 70. Accordingly, I do not intend to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Bill has not been given due attention by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Seven long meetings were held on Committee Stage on this legislation and no amendment has been tabled on Report Stage which has not already been debated on Committee Stage. The Bill is not being rushed through the House as the Deputy alleges.</P>
    <P>Although the Deputy is entitled to raise matters in the House, if she wishes to make statements in the House on the plight of a certain child or certain children, I would urge her in the first instance to take up the matter with the appropriate authorities to allow them to pursue it. She referred to a particular case in the House this morning which it appears she did not bring to the health board's attention. In fairness to the relevant people in the health board and other statutory agencies, I recommend that in future the Deputy should raise particular cases with them to allow them to follow them up rather than raising them in the House in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister accepts that Members are entitled to raise matters in the House as I did earlier. The case to which I referred was very relevant to the business in hand where the Minister sought to convey the impression that we have a very good child welfare protection service. I outlined a number of examples, including that to which the Minister referred, to show that our child welfare protection services are actually in chaos and I stand over that completely.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the Bill, as it stands, allows the Minister to make regulations which I recognise. However, my amendment, if accepted, would require the Minister to make regulations.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In page 51, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;and no questioning of such child shall <Col N="122" /> take place nor written statement be sought in the absence of video recording of what occurs.</P>
    <P>(2) Any information obtained by An Garda Síochána pursuant to <i>subsection (1)</i> shall be inadmissible as evidence in the absence of a video recording of the obtaining of such information.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 61 deals with the interviewing of children. Subsection (1) provides that:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsections (2) to (4), a child who has been detained in a Garda Síochána station pursuant to any enactment shall not be questioned, or asked to make a written statement, in relation to an offence in respect of which he or she has been arrested unless in the present of&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) a parent or guardian, or</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) in his or her absence, another adult (not being a member of the Garda Síochána) nominated by the member in charge of the station.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes to add the following to subsection (1): &ldquo;and no questioning of such child shall take place nor written statement be sought in the absence of video recording of what occurs.&rdquo;. It further seeks the inclusion of an additional subsection (2) which would read: &ldquo;Any information obtained by An Garda Síochána pursuant to <i>subsection (1)</i> shall be inadmissible as evidence in the absence of a video recording of the obtaining of such information.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to ensure a policy announced by the Minister some years ago in regard to the installation of video recording in Garda stations is actually implemented and applied to children who may make self-incriminatory statements. In the context of such statements being made, it is widely recognised that the availability of video recording would be in the interest of the Garda Síochána to protect it from false allegations of mistreatment or pressure. Such recordings could, if necessary, be furnished to the courts should prosecutions ensue. Video recordings would also serve the interests of and protect those making statements. It would ensure nobody would be subjected to ill treatment of any kind.</P>
    <P>I note that the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors was recently critical of the Minister in regard to the delays experienced in implementing a programme to provide for video recording. At the very least, when dealing with children who do not necessarily understand the law or who may be vulnerable to pressures &ndash; which may not come from the Garda at all, but from parents or guardians who may exert pressure on a distraught child to admit to something he or she did not do &ndash; it is important that an objective record of the exchanges leading to statements being made would be available, particularly where those statements contain admissions. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment implies that every Garda station in the country would at all times have available in it the equipment and facilities to enable the video recording of all interviews with children. The following is the present position with regard to video recording statements made in Garda stations. Statements made in the course of Garda interviews with suspects are being video recorded in a limited number of stations refurbished and equipped for this purpose. Work is also well advanced in terms of a nationwide scheme which will cover approximately 150 stations and is expected to be completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Garda video recording is carried out under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and the Electronic Recording of Interviews Regulations, 1997. These regulations provide for the recording of interviews in respect of detained persons, but this is subject to the availability of the equipment and other circumstances. Accordingly, it is the case that not all the relevant interviews are recorded, even in the stations in which cameras have been installed. The 1997 regulations do not make specific provision for the situation in which the person being interviewed is a child, but they were drafted to operate in conjunction with the 1987 custody regulations which cater for interviews with persons under 17 years.</P>
      <P>The 1997 regulations are in the course of being revised in the light of experience and to take on board certain points raised by the steering committee overseeing the recording project. In essence, however, it is envisaged that the existing model would remain largely intact. This would mean, in particular, that recording would be the general rule, but would not apply if, for example, the equipment was not available or not operating properly.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment appears to be to require that all interviews involving the questioning of children as suspects should be recorded on video. Quite frankly, this would be impracticable as recording equipment is not available in every Garda station. There are also substantial costs involved; apart from the equipment itself, each interview room must be specially fitted out for lighting and other purposes. The estimated cost of providing the appropriate facilities, including training and storage, for approximately 150 Garda stations is in the region of £10 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment does not make any distinction in terms of the offences it is intended to cover and it is inevitable that the number of recording units will be limited. It would be unrealistic to expect an interview with an adult in a very serious case to be brought to an end to make equipment available for a minor offence involving a child. Interviews in serious cases involving children should be recorded which is the general position in the current and proposed regulations. The Deputy is aware that section 61 provides for the interviewing of children in the presence of a parent or other adult. This should provide a substantial degree of protection for both the child and <Col N="124" /> the interviewing process. In the circumstances, certainly for lesser offences, the necessity of having child interviews video recorded should be reduced. For the reasons outlined, I cannot accept the amendment. Regarding any criticism in relation to installing the relevant equipment, all I can say is that I am always happy to be criticised for doing positive things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being criticised for the lethargic manner in which he has implemented what he announced to be Government policy. Some four years into the life of the Government most of the designated Garda stations have not had video recording equipment installed. In this modern age every Garda station should be so equipped and there is no particular reason this should not be the case. These amendments would be an important protection, for the Garda and children, and would provide the means to maintain an objective record of what occurs when a statement is made. This record could be viewed by a court should disputes arise about the credibility of a statement and the circumstances in which it was taken. In the circumstances I am pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(8) For the purposes of this section a parent or guardian shall not be regarded as obstructing the course of justice where he or she advises a child of his or her right to remain silent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment, again, relates to section 61 which deals with the interviewing of children. Subsection (3) provides that:</P>
      <P>The member in charge of the station may authorise the exclusion of a parent or guardian during the questioning of a child or the taking of a written statement where&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) the parent or guardian is the victim of or has been arrested in respect of the offence being investigated,</P>

      <P>(<i>c</i>) the member has reasonable grounds for believing that the parent or guardian would, if present during questioning or the taking of a written statement, be likely to obstruct the course of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask Minister to take my amendment on board in the context of it ensuring, where a parent is <Col N="125" /> present and furnishes advice to a child of a legal nature, there would be no possibility of the parent being excluded from remaining in the room for this reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 61(4) authorises the member in charge of the station to remove an adult from where a child is being questioned or a written statement is being taken where the member has reasonable grounds for believing that the conduct of the adult amounts to an obstruction of the course of justice. The amendment seeks to offer a partial guideline to the meaning of obstruction by excluding from it advice given by the adult of the child's right to remain silent. I have given considerable thought to this amendment before Committee Stage and, on balance, my conclusion remains that neither the interests of the child nor of the parents or other adult would be served by its acceptance.</P>
      <P>I have come to this conclusion for the following reasons. With regard to the question of whether giving legal advice could be regarded as an obstruction, it would seem that such could never be caused by a person taking reasonable precautions to safeguard the rights of his or her child. If anything, it could be regarded as furthering the course of justice. Advising a person of a legal right is not an obstruction, no matter what the circumstances. My problem with the amendment is that parents should not, by means of a legislative provision, be perceived as encouraged to offer legal advice which they are singularly unqualified to give. Therefore, no reference should be made to their giving such advice, no matter what the context. Obstruction is not defined, neither here nor in comparable legislation, and giving a partial meaning or providing a guideline towards its meaning could do more harm than good by introducing uncertainty. Advising a child of his or her right to remain silent amounts to legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most cases the child will have already received legal advice from his or her solicitor who is the person qualified to give that advice. In the vast majority of cases, the parents or other adults would not be appropriate persons to give legal advice and their amateur advice could conflict with the professional advice already given. It is not just a question of telling a child to remain silent and all will be well. Such a decision could have major implications in any subsequent criminal trial and any advice to this effect could only properly be given by a solicitor armed with the facts of the case. For example, under section 7 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, and section 5 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, inferences can be drawn from an accused's decision to remain silent or not mention facts later relied on at trial when being questioned or charged by the Garda in relation to a drug trafficking offence or an offence against the State. I am preparing further legislation which proposes to apply to other serious offences provisions similar to section 7 of <Col N="126" /> the 1996 Act. In such cases advice to remain silent could have implications later on.</P>
    <P>The amendment also raises the question of the precise role of parents or other adults when present at the questioning of their children. I referred to this matter in a previous amendment. I will not repeat myself other than to point to the power, under section 70, to make regulations on this role. For the reasons stated, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I simply conclude by pointing out to the Minister that a failure to include this amendment, in the context of referring the House to existing legislative provisions which result in presumptions or conclusions being drawn from exercising the right to remain silent, means we will be in conflict with the European convention. I wonder if he is aware of the fact that there was recently a decision relating to the convention affecting Scottish law where it was held that the right to prevent self-incrimination was one which meant one could not by way of legislation have in place provisions in criminal law that place someone under an onus, in the context of a criminal trial, and at risk in a criminal trial of conviction because they failed to offer explanations. Some of the legislation to which the Minister has drawn the attention of the House will no longer be able to operate under the European convention, in the context of the Bill we will be dealing with tomorrow, with which it will be deemed incompatible. I regret that with regard to children the Minister is unwilling to take on board this particular amendment which, as I am conscious of time, I will press.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 77 sets out the principles to be observed by the Children's Court when dealing with children charged with offences. An amendment from Deputy Shortall on Committee Stage, which has been resubmitted, sought to extend the requirements of the section to other courts and not confine it to the Children's Court. I had no problem with the aim of the amendment in that respect. However, as section 77 was in Part 8 of the Bill, which deals solely with the procedures of the Children's Court, I was unable to accept the amendment. I undertook to consult the parliamentary counsel to see if it could be accommodated elsewhere in the Bill. The amendments I am now happy to propose transfer the text of section 77, amended, in order that it extends to <Col N="127" /> all courts, to section 97. I am happy to commend the amendments in my name to the House.</P>
    <P>The Committee Stage amendment from Deputy Shortall and the resubmitted Report Stage amendment also seek to extend the principles established in section 77 to all children before a court, not just those charged with offences. I could not accept that element of the amendment because section 77 and Parts 5 to 10 are integral parts of the juvenile justice system and have nothing to do with child care or protection. The wording of section 77 clearly relates to child offenders and care and protection issues could not appropriately be applied to it. The rights of children in care and protection proceedings are already well catered for in the Child Care Act, 1991. While I thank the Deputy for bringing the issue to my attention on Committee Stage, I could not accept one aspect of it. Therefore, while recommending the amendments in my name, which will put into effect much of what the Deputy sought to achieve, I cannot accept her amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 62, to delete lines 10 to 14.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to remanding young offenders in custody. This is a long-running problem where children on remand have been mixed with children being detained and has given rise to all kinds of difficulties. Often children remanded for assessment can be quite young. It is entirely inappropriate for them to be remanded with children who may have been before the courts on several occasions and may be serving lengthy sentences. The principle of separating those serving sentences and those on remand in relation to adults should also be extended to juveniles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section sets out a number of principles relating to the conditions under which children should be remanded in custody. I am concerned that subsection (5) gives the Minister a free hand to designate as a junior remand centre any place, including part of any children's detention school which in his or her opinion is suitable for the custody of children who are remanded in custody pursuant to subsection (2). The free hand that <Col N="128" /> gives the Minister negates much of the rest of the section, which is very welcome, and allows the existing unsatisfactory situation to continue. That would be a retrograde step and I urge the Minister to delete it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <P>Section 89(5) empowers the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the agreement of the Minister for Education and Science, to designate a junior remand centre, that is, a remand centre for children aged between 12 and 15 years, inclusive, as any place, including part of any children's detention school.</P>
      <P>The effect of accepting the amendment would be that we could provide no places for remand in custody for that age group as the power of designation would not be available. While the intention is to keep as many young persons as possible out of custody and on bail, a number of remand places would always be required. It is often in the child's interests because, for example, of home circumstances, to be remanded in custody while awaiting his or her case to be heard. The child may also be remanded for the preparation of a probation and welfare officer's or other report and, again, the emphasis will be on assessment in the community. In this context, the new Finglas facility, which I mentioned on Committee Stage, is relevant.</P>
      <P>It is prudent to keep options open by allowing for a situation where a junior remand centre could be part of a children's detention school. The number of children on remand can be small, but a situation could arise where, for example, a 15 year old girl on remand would effectively be held in solitary confinement if not allowed controlled association with selected female detainees in the same age group. Accordingly, I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>We had quite a debate on this matter on Committee Stage which concerns the attendance in court by parents or guardians. There is no doubt that there is a difficulty in a small number of cases where parents refuse, for one reason or another, to attend in court. This is obviously clearly unacceptable. My concern is with the wording of the Bill, as it stands; it states that failure by the parents or guardian, without reasonable excuse, to attend any such proceedings shall, subject to subsection (5), be treated for all purposes as if it were contempt in the face of the court.</P>
      <P>This is very strange wording and I am not sure what it means. Either it is contempt or it is not; either it is an offence or it is not. How can it be treated as if it is an offence? This will give rise to a fair amount of confusion. For this reason I propose we delete the subsection.</P>

      <P>The amendment seeks to repeal section 92(3) under which parents can be held in contempt of court for failure to obey a court order to attend court with their children. Section 92(1) requires parents to attend court with their children and is subject to subsection (5) to which I will come. Subsection (2) deals with the situation, if it arises, where parents, without reasonable excuse, fail to attend the proceedings. The court will have the power to issue a warrant commanding the parents to be produced before the court. Failure by the parents without reasonable excuse to attend would be a contempt of court. If that provision, which is provided for in subsection (3), were deleted, there would be no mechanism for ensuring their attendance and section 92 would be worthless and toothless.</P>
      <P>There is nothing unreasonable about section 92. Parents are not expected to do the impossible. If they have a reasonable excuse, they can be excused from attending. Subsection (5) is very clear in its intent: parents can be excused from attending court if the court is of the opinion that the interests of justice would not be served by such attendance. The Deputy said on Committee Stage that the phrase &ldquo;treated for all purposes as if it were a contempt in the face of the court&rdquo; was a legal nonsense. I have had this method of dealing with contempt checked out and I am satisfied on the basis of further advice I have received that it is a perfectly legal and legitimate way of ensuring parents who do not attend court can be treated as if it were a contempt in the face of the court.</P>
      <P>This is an important section, the success of which will depend on the ability of the court to ensure parents, where possible, attend with their children. The amendment would remove that ability of the court. For this reason, I cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>Section 109 provides that a fine imposed on a child cannot exceed half that which could be imposed on an adult for the same offence. Although section 109 is virtually identical to section 86 of the 1996 Bill, it did give rise to some comment on the basis that children would not have the money to pay fines.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the argument. &ldquo;Children&rdquo; in the Bill includes persons up to 18 years and even at younger ages many children have part-time or temporary jobs. However, I would not accept the implications of the amendment, that children have the same means to pay as adults. I say this, although section 110 gives clear guidelines concerning present and future means to pay. The question of providing for fines as a penalty had to be faced up to in the legislation as the present law is, to say the least, unsatisfactory, dating back to 1884. For example, a child under 15 years of age can only be fined a maximum of £2 for a summary offence tried summarily. A child tried summarily for an indictable offence can be fined a maximum of £2. A young person aged 15 or 16 years tried summarily for an indictable offence can be fined a maximum of £10. A young person tried summarily for a summary offence can be fined the same as an adult.</P>
      <P>The amendment treats children the same as adults with regard to the imposition of fines. There is some logic to the amendment in that other penalties for offences such as detention have, in some circumstances, the same maximum for all persons found guilty or convicted regardless of age. On the other hand, one of the purposes of the Bill is to provide the courts with an intervention and penalty structure suited to children. For example, the restorative conferencing provisions and the community sanctions are designed specifically for children. Similarly, the fines structure is designed specifically for children. Despite their potential earning capacity and the obligation on the court to ascertain ability to pay, children could not be expected to have the same disposable cash as adults. I therefore submit that section 109, in proposing that the maximum fines payable by children should be no more than half those payable by adults in respect of the same offences, should remain part of the Bill and, despite what I referred to as a certain logic in the amendment, I am not prepared to accept it.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Deputy D. Wallace).</P>
    <P>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin: The motion before the House is timely and serves to draw much needed attention to the effect of infrastructural development on local communities. Road building and an efficient transport infrastructure are essential to the economic progress of this nation. Coming from a constituency where tourism is the primary economic activity I am well aware of the need to invest heavily in our infrastructure. Access to County Kerry's tourist hot spots is closely linked to the availability of a good transport network. Without such a network, problems of congestion and basic access apply.</P>
    <P>In Killarney, traffic congestion is an everyday occurrence with tour buses, cars and other heavy vehicles causing delays. In other more isolated areas, the lack of a decent road surface turns visitors away. The solution to these problems does not lie in coming in with a bulldozer and building new roads. The &ldquo;bull in a china shop&rdquo; approach simply does not work. It fuels resentment and unease in local communities and slows up the process of putting in place quality infrastructure. Some time <Col N="133" /> ago, with the building of the new Tralee-Castleisland road, people living and farmers with land alongside the new development were seriously discommoded. To this date, they remain aggrieved because they feel that they were not adequately compensated for the level of disruption which they endured at the time.</P>
    <P>There are serious issues which need to be addressed if the roads that obviously need to be built are to be put in place. One of the crucial issues is consultation. To date, much of the protest about road building has centred on the fact that local communities affected by the proposed roads have not been consulted. They are of the view that plans are drawn up, decisions are made and only at the eleventh hour are they given any real voice. By then, they only have the opportunity to influence minor elements of the project. The public is not against new roads. Most of them are road users and agree wholeheartedly that upgrading and new developments are required. If local communities are consulted from day one in the planning of new road developments, their concerns can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>The next issue is that of compensation. It is one thing compensating people for the value of their property, but there are a wide range of other problems which are not recognised through the compensation process. Some of these issues were outlined last night by my colleague, Deputy Penrose, with particular regard to farmers. Those farmers who have experienced the building of new roads across their farm lands will be aware of the multitude of problems they face. In some cases, farms become unviable because the splitting of a farm is not conducive to continuing certain specialist practices. In others, it becomes hugely inconvenient for farmers to move animals because the farm is split by a busy road.</P>
    <P>To recognise these problems it is essential that both the compulsory purchase order procedures and compensation are reviewed and adjusted to reflect the problems experienced by those who have been discommoded. As I said, road building is a vital component in our continued economic success. Coming from the constituency of Kerry South I am acutely aware of this need because we are one of the most infrastructually neglected constituencies in the State. Our roads have been ignored by the Government. South Kerry depends heavily on tourism. The condition of our roadways leaves much to be desired, not to mention the difficulties experienced on a daily basis by those who live in the constituency.</P>
    <P>For example, the N86 from Tralee to Dingle has become one of the most renowned infrastructural black spots in the country. My constituency office has had to deal on a daily basis with people travelling this road who have had to have major repairs carried out to their cars. I am also aware of many tourists to the Dingle Peninsula who have sworn not to travel on the N86 ever again. I invite any Minister in the Government to drive their State car from Tralee to Dingle if they do not believe these claims.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> We have had a farcical situation in south Kerry in recent months whereby line painters employed to line our roads have painted lines in water-filled potholes. These line painters from Scotland have expressed their sheer amazement about the appalling condition of our road network. I am reliably informed that they have never come across such an outrageous situation.</P>
    <P>Not only that, cats eyes have been fitted on some of south Kerry's roads, such as the N86, only to be scattered everywhere within hours of being put down. Locals in the Dingle Peninsula have gathered bags of loose cats eyes which they collected off their roads. This is a disgraceful waste of taxpayer's money. My constituents deserve better.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry has had enough to cope with in recent months without comments from tourists about the appalling condition of our roads. The tourism industry in south Kerry is one which we value greatly, but which must also be nurtured consistently. If the necessary funding to repair road surfaces is not forthcoming, all the marketing in the world to attract tourists to our county will not be worth an atom.</P>
    <P>More importantly, the residents of my constituency in towns and villages such as Annascaul, Camp, Castlegregory, Rathmore, Scartaglen, Waterville, Sneem and many more have had their expectations from the Celtic tiger dashed by the Government. They have had to endure a lack of accountability and information from the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the National Roads Authority &ndash; the latter being one of the most inaccessible and unaccountable public bodies in the State. Several public meetings in south Kerry about road conditions have failed to secure answers from engineers and other officials in the NRA. When the NRA was established there was no proviso which made it answerable to any Department. It is time this issue was addressed.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the urban-rural imbalance in infrastructural funding has still not levelled out. By this I mean my constituents find it unpalatable that urban areas, particularly on the eastern seaboard, continue to remain the principal focus of the Government's investment in roads. While I acknowledge that south Kerry has one of the highest <i>per capita</i> ratios of roads, I do not believe that this is sufficient reason to continually ignore the area. During the last election, my constituents were promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his partner in Government, Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae, that we would have dual carriageways and motorways up to every back door. That was nothing short of bluff and blunder.</P>
    <P>When the Labour Party was in government, the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Howlin, announced a radical and substantial package of proposals to repair the country's road network. I am sure that the Government will tell me that it has invested unprecedented sums of money in our roads, but <Col N="135" /> we have not seen much of it in south Kerry. Ask the average man or woman, the taxpayer, on the Tralee to Dingle road or the Rathmore to Killarney Road if they have seen any investment in their roads and their answer will be a resounding &ldquo;No&rdquo;. It is fine to promise millions of pounds, but as we are all well aware, the road to Heaven is paved with good intentions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Aylward, McGuinness and Ellis.</P>
      <P>A vital cornerstone of economic success is decent roads. The Government's performance in terms of putting carriageways in place has been dramatic. At more than £620 million plus £40 million for maintenance, the increase in funding to the National Roads Authority has been extraordinary and quite dramatic and helped to improve many carriageways. We will continue work on the Euro routes and other projects between main towns.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the day when I will be able save 58 minutes driving from Cork to Dublin. Currently, the journey is stressful and time consuming, high petrol costs are incurred and I often encounter road rage, whether going through many of the smaller towns or in the continuous bottleneck in Kildare town. In this regard, I welcome the amount being invested in the national road network.</P>
      <P>The concept of a National Roads Authority brings to mind an era in the Dáil when it was considered desirable for everything to be carried out by independent bodies removed from the democratic process. Everybody forgot that with independence came an autocratic group which frequently did not listen to what the people, and sometimes even the Government, had to say. It forces one to ask to whom such bodies are answerable, whether it be An Bord Pleanála or the National Roads Authority. Are they answerable to the Oireachtas or the people? Do they listen to the people? There is a democratic deficit in terms of the independence of these authorities. They become aloof and opinionated, answerable only to themselves. Unknowingly, we might have created a monster. Regard for the democratic process, therefore, is vitally important.</P>
      <P>Consider the psyche of landowners, how much they love their holdings and how loath they are to lose them. When one sees the beautiful stretches of land being interfered with by highways, one can appreciate that many farms are also being interfered with. While it makes no difference to a farmer with 200 acres of land, it makes a significant difference to a farmer with 45 acres of land through which a road passes. I have some sympathy with farmers in terms of the CPO. It is a case of public utility versus the rights of the individual and we have to ask whether landowners get a fair deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consider, for example, the Ballincollig bypass stretching to the boundary with County Kerry in which thousands of acres of land are involved. <Col N="136" /> Over a ten year period it has been sterilised. Nothing has happened to it. There has been no planning permission in any quarter. In Ballincollig, the development has been one-sided, involving a long stretch of two miles. The bypass runs through an area adjacent to the town that would have served as a heartland. There is a green belt. When compensation is being paid and a compulsory purchase order considered, landowners ask those involved in arbitration with them if they will get real value for their land. They ask if it is proper that, for ten years, land has been set aside and allowed stay as agricultural land when all other landowners in the area have been permitted to develop their land, build houses on it and attain massive prices for it.</P>
    <P>Multiple routes are always proposed for a road until one is finally approbated. The gestation period is so long that it may not be fair to the individuals concerned. In terms of the procedures pertaining to CPOs, it is well worth looking at how we might modernise our views and the arbitration involved in giving landowners a fair price for their land taking into account that it has been set aside in many instances. If this had not happened, what value would have been placed on it?</P>
    <P>Now that the road is being constructed in the Ballincollig area we can make some recompense. There should be some relationship between the local authority, the landowners and the National Roads Authority to determine how some of the land could be used. Zoning would be one such use. In this regard the Minister should look at the deficit that has been created.</P>
    <P>One must examine the role of the National Roads Authority and those who will negotiate with farmers. Many of the personnel we will bring to bear on this issue will be highly qualified, foreigners, but unaware of the psyche of dealmaking and negotiation in Ireland. This, in itself, is a deficit and will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Decent roads are an absolute necessity for economic well-being which can be achieved, but we must do so in a fair and open-minded manner. I am concerned that some of the farmers in my hinterland feel they have been hard done by. The CPO process needs to be renegotiated in order that landowners will feel they will get a fair price, which is their right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to recognise what has been achieved by the Department of the Environment and Local Government through the National Roads Authority as part of the national development plan in respect of which a need for five major corridors was identified. The N8 and N9 run through my constituency to the South East. A great and successful effort was made by local representatives, supported by all the local and regional authorities, IBEC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and employers etc., to ensure one of the major corridors would run to the south east through my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny. This achievement provoked a sense of euphoria. Since then a number of pres<Col N="137" /> tigious companies have established in my county providing much needed jobs. It was asserted that <i>per capita</i> income in my constituency was far lower than the national average. Progress has, therefore, been made in redressing this imbalance since the construction of the corridor was announced.</P>
      <P>My support for the N8 and N9 road projects must not be at the expense of my respect for the rights of land and property owners along the proposed routes, not only farmers, but house owners also. This in not to say that I do not support the proposed route, but there should be improved consultation between the National Roads Authority, the local authorities and the people affected. The identification in some cases of three, four or five alternative routes was a cause of unnecessary major panic and alarm. That is the wrong way to do business and it really upset people. Let us be honest and state that 75% of the people concerned at present, because we have reached that stage of the process, will not be affected in the long-term. We inherited this system from the old British model which advocated a policy of divide and conquer. In the end, 75% of people will be happy but no one will be prepared to fight the cause of the 25% through whose lands the line will run.</P>
      <P>The level of compensation is completely inadequate. A previous speaker made the case about a small farmer with a holding of 45 or 50 acres. In my area most land holdings would range in size from 30 and 150 acres, but that is not to say that there are not also some very large holdings. The smaller landowners to whom I refer are involved in quite intensive dairy operations. If a farmer with a holding of 45 acres loses five acres, his holding will no longer be viable. If a person has to sell off five cows because of the intensity of his or her operation, that operation will no longer be viable. That is the situation we face. Some people will have their livelihoods taken away and we must do something about that.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the payment of capital gains tax on compensation payments. It strikes me as unfair that capital gains tax will have to be paid unless a person immediately invests in other agricultural activity. The proposed level of compensation would not be adequate to replace the loss of land and if a person in an area is going to be affected, his or her neighbours will also be affected. In those circumstances, the competition for available land, if any exists, will be more intense. A person with a small operation would, therefore, not have the opportunity to replace the land they lost.</P>
      <P>I find it totally objectionable that between 10% to 20% of the overall cost of the provision of these roads is paid to consultants, while farmers, who are actually losing their land, only obtain in the range of 3% to 5%. That matter is worthy of further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lack of consultation and a dearth of information. People should be given adequate time in which to submit questionnaires. For <Col N="138" /> example, serious delays have occurred because of the foot and mouth crisis but, in the case to which I am specifically referring, namely, the N8 and N9, people are expected to have returned their questionnaires by 15 June, which is just not possible. The farming organisations should have the opportunity to consult on behalf of their clients. I know that reasonable and substantial submissions were made by the IFA and the ICMSA. I ask that an agricultural liaison officer be appointed in each local authority area and that there should be an independent adjudication of costs and fair procedures for dealing with problem cases and complaints. I also request that mediation costs be covered and that costs should also be awarded in the event of oral hearings taking place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal put forward by the IFA that a CPO ombudsman should be appointed. That would be a good development, particularly when one considers the level of expenditure involved. The CPO ombudsman should be appointed for the duration of the work to investigate all complaints and, in particular, consider the assessment of compensation. I accept that criteria have already been laid down, but the appointment of such an officer would be a positive step and I ask the Minister to consider it favourably.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provision of underpasses and overpasses. My county has had a number of past experiences in respect of road building and there has been a niggardly approach on the part of the authorities in granting applications for overpasses and underpasses. The authorities should be far more generous in this area in order to attract the goodwill of the farmers, landowners and property owners affected by road construction. Consideration must also be given to the maintenance of fencing, proper drainage and the relief of flooding, access for local traffic and disturbance to local communities.</P>
    <P>The IFA adopted a policy yesterday to the effect that representatives of the NRA will not be granted access to all lands in the counties of Kildare, Carlow, Kilkenny and Laois. That matter should be raised with the authority. There is a a need to obtain the goodwill of the organisations involved and the people who will be affected. The way to do that is to consult them at the beginning of the process and not to proceed on a piecemeal basis. Difficulties arose in south Kilkenny because matters were dealt with on a weekly basis. That is not good enough because it led to doubts being placed in people's minds.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister and the Department should take the initiative and insist that the National Roads Authority and the local authorities come together to foster an atmosphere of goodwill which will allow these welcome and necessary projects to be completed. In my opinion, everyone will then be satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>On an Adjournment debate last week I indicated quite clearly that I was not against the road construction programme. People involved in business or those who travel through<Col N="139" /> out the country will have witnessed at first hand the need not only for an integrated transport system but also the need to upgrade the existing road system. There is also a need to upgrade and modernise the rail system, a development which has not yet taken place and which forms part of the problem with which we are now faced.</P>
      <P>I wish to dwell on two specific points. I raised the issue of the compulsory purchase order system at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party today and on last week's Adjournment debate. My experience of this matter relates to the Norris case in Kilkenny and the difficulties surrounding the Milford over-bridge at Glenmore, where local communities were severed. In the latter instance, the NRA presented a plan and literally cut off the local community. A footbridge was provided at great cost, with a contribution from the local authority, but proper access to it was not granted. That was completely ridiculous. I am also familiar with the Norris case and in the Adjournment debate to which I refer I asked that this case be used as a model to allow us to discover what exactly happened, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the actions of the NRA relative to those of the local council, in order to determine how best to improve the system of compulsory purchase.</P>
      <P>The compulsory purchase system is completely inadequate. It does not reflect the fact that farmers do not wish to sell their land. They are obliged to negotiate the sale of their land because of the fact that the construction of a particular road has been visited upon them. Roads are there for the common good. Due to the fact that roads such as the N8 and N9 are being constructed for the betterment of regional, local and national economies, society and the Government should be prepared to pay landowners and farmers a price for land which falls somewhere between the value of agricultural land and the market value of development land. We must face facts on this matter. By using the compulsory purchase system, we are actually stealing farmers' lands, dividing their farms, diminishing their properties, reducing the income they can gain from their lands and, in some instances, making their holdings unviable. It is time the Government and everyone involved in politics realised that this system is not working. We need to rectify matters and ensure that a system is put in place, under which fair prices will be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the N8 and N9 because people affected by their construction will be exposed to the existing compulsory purchase system. By the time a new system is introduced, many farmers will have been obliged to avail of this system and will literally have been robbed of their lands, their quality of life and the level of livelihood they enjoyed until the construction of the roads commenced. There is a necessity to fast-track the process and put in place a system which will deliver the land for development, if necessary. Do we need four-lane motorways? Would the upgrading of the N9 and the bypassing <Col N="140" /> of Carlow and Kilkenny not be a better option, particularly if it occurred in conjunction with an upgrading and modernisation of the railway system. In terms of the N8 and N9, there is a need to put in place a system under which farmers or landowners will not have to stump up money for consultants and other professionals to prove their case against local authorities or the NRA.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a mediation system earlier in the process and for a compulsory purchase ombudsman, as outlined in the case put before the social partners by the IFA in its document, Code for the Fair Acquisition of Land for Infrastructural Development. The ICMSA has also made a submission in this area. All it seeks in the discussion documents is fair play. It has seen at first hand through the Norris case and Milford Bridge that it does not get fair play. If the country is to benefit from these motorways, we should be prepared to pay for the land.</P>
    <P>The regulations governing provision of information to landowners and those processing their complaints are not being fully adhered to. In Kilkenny, the maps on which these roads will be based and planned have not been given to landowners and farmers to make their submissions which must be made within two weeks. That is ridiculous. No community, group or individual could mount a proper submission based on such poor information and within that short space of time.</P>
    <P>In the context of the N8 and N9, I ask the NRA to grant further time for the local authority to debate the issue, for us to analyse whether we are taking the right course by building a four lane highway or whether we should upgrade the N9 instead, and for farmers and landowners to conduct proper consultation with their communities to make appropriate submissions on their behalf. That is necessary and is a small request in what is a very large project. It is the least we can do for the local communities and landowners concerned. I urge the Minister to take on board the ICMSA and IFA submissions and make the necessary adjustments to the system so that people along the N8 and N9 can benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing road improvements, I am sure we all understand and accept that there is a need to upgrade the road network throughout the country. Some of my colleagues have problems with roads being given motorway status. I wish I had the same problem with the road from Mullingar to Sligo. That said, the Government has committed to upgrade the N4 to dual carriageway standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main point to be borne in mind is that, while these improvements are being made, people's livelihoods and day-to-day activities are being severely affected. The compensation system in place poses major problems. Where a person has his or her farm divided in two, for example, and he or she loses four or five acres, it would be ridiculous for that lost land to be valued in commercial agricultural terms, which would be <Col N="141" /> about £5,000 an acre. Not only would the farm have been divided, the running costs for the farm would have been significantly increased. Some people in this position have to do a round trip of two or three miles to get to the other half of their farms because no common sense has been used nor have underpasses and overbridges been provided to accommodate communities and people affected.</P>
    <P>On top of that, the loss of potential earning from the use of the land is not ever taken into consideration. The loss of one dairy cow can mean a gross loss of £1,600 to £2,000 per annum. If a person loses five acres in an intensive dairy project, that can amount to an annual loss of £8,000 to £10,000 in gross income. How is a person to be compensated for that? Is a scale of compensation to be set up to take into account consequential losses?</P>
    <P>On top of that is the increased cost of running the farm which sometimes means the question of viability arises quickly. If a person's quota is reduced from 45,000 to 35,000 gallons because he or she cannot keep the necessary stock, that is a major loss. That must be addressed in any compensation programme put in place.</P>
    <P>I know the NRA has a mandate to deal as quickly as possible with road improvements and we support that, but in so doing, we must take into consideration the effect some of these major road projects could have on communities, such as their division and the increased difficulty of access to local facilities, such as the local corner shop, pub or other facilities which we in rural Ireland have come to accept.</P>
    <P>The most effective action can be taken at the planning stage to prevent major problems. Consideration should be given to the consequential loss to communities and individuals of the routes planned. The floating out of four or five routes for a proposed stretch of road is stupid because it divides neighbour against neighbour and brother against brother. It comes down to that in some cases. That is not something anyone wants. If common sense prevailed in route selection and compensation, we would not see these problems arise. They are only beginning and let no one be under any illusions about that.</P>
    <P>These are the first major road projects for a few years other than those completed under the local authority system. All we have had up to now are bypasses of towns and villages. We know the consequential loss in some cases and the advantages in others where towns and villages have been bypassed. In some cases it has encouraged people to go to those towns because they will not face the gridlock they faced prior to the bypasses being put in place.</P>
    <P>When I first travelled to the Dáil from Leitrim, I always came by Cavan. Now that Mullingar and Longford have been bypassed, I come by those towns because I can save 25 to 30 minutes on the journey as well as experiencing less pressure driving.</P>
    <P>We need these new roads to improve quality of <Col N="142" /> life and our industrial performance but we cannot have them at the expense of local communities. Common sense must prevail. I encourage the Minister to talk to the NRA and ask it to be constructive in its actions, to talk to people and discuss its actions with them and not to try to force them down people's throats. That does not and will not work, and anyone in the political field learned that lesson last week. One cannot tell people what to do. They are the best judges of what they want to do. Despite the best attempts that may be made in selling certain road improvement projects, it is imperative that local people are given full consideration.</P>
    <P>It is also important in the context of major road developments that the second class, third class and regional roads are not neglected. We know rural roads affect everyone's livelihoods, the development of communities and the progress of people's lives. No one wants to live with potholed roads and no one should be expected to. It is imperative in the context of overall road development that consideration be given to the people who use them every day over those who use them occasionally. I say that knowing that the Acting Chairman, as someone who originally came from rural Ireland, will understand that the first bone of contention was and always will be the roads, be they motorways, national or local roads.</P>

      <P>Lack of consultation has been raised by a number of speakers. It is important given the effect the roads programme in the national development plan will have on local communities. This debate is the flip side of the national development plan, namely, the effect it has on local communities. Many road proposals will split communities and no consideration is given to the effect such proposals will have on them. In many cases a small change in a route could accommodate local communities. Where possible, this should be done. There has been no consultation. The line of proposed roads can have a devastating effect on many communities. The effect on Cashel, for example, is evident.</P>
      <P>The question of the price paid to landowners is important. Enormous sums are spent on roads. More than £6.5 billion is to be spent on the national road network. Landowners should be paid a fair price for their land. Deputy Aylward made an important point about the large amounts paid to consultants, engineers, project managers, archaeologists, geologists and others. Professional fees could account for up to 20% of the cost of a road. Those whose land is being taken by compulsory purchase order should be adequately recompensed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> The issue of tolling is being discussed in the media currently. It is proposed to toll roads which by-pass towns. The Dublin-Cork route is used by many people on a daily basis and it is essential for their businesses. These are not trippers or holidaymakers who use the road merely for pleasure. Due to the traffic congestion the journey from Dublin to Cork now takes up to five hours so the proposed development is very welcome. The Fermoy, Cashel, Kildare and Cullohill bypasses will reduce travelling time by at least one hour. I am alarmed by the proposal to toll parts of this road because this will add greatly to the cost of driving on the road on a daily basis. Even before we know whether the Kildare by-pass will be tolled we can calculate that the return journey from Dublin to Cork will cost at least £5.50 for a car and £14.40 for a heavy goods vehicle. Over a year the cost to an enterprise could mount to about £1,000, in addition to other costs. We must give serious consideration to the proposal to toll roads.</P>
    <P>The opponents of the Fermoy by-pass make a very valid point when they say that if the toll is high, toll dodgers will drive through the town and cause congestion. Other countries such as France and Spain do not toll by-passes because it is recognised that tolling a town by-pass would have an adverse effect on traffic in the town. Tolling by-passes has two disadvantages. It adds cost to motorists who are obliged to use a particular route and it encourages motorists to avoid the by-pass and drive through the centre of the town.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government is to learn any lesson from last week's referendum debacle it is that one should listen to the people and to communities. I will confine my remarks to the subject of the National Roads Authority, which is to the 21st century what unscrupulous landlords were to the 19th. This unelected quango has no regard for families or people or for the concepts of consultation or accountability. These are all alien to its terms of reference. Approximately 130 years ago tenant farmers fought for the three Fs &ndash; fair rent, free sale and fixity of tenure. Today rural communities are fighting for three new Fs &ndash; fast access to documentation, full consultation and fair compensation. Their fight is well grounded.</P>
      <P>The Government must immediately bring in legislation to curtail the sweeping powers of the unaccountable National Roads Authority, which allows private consultants and, so called, experts to ride rough shod over the feelings, views and concerns of thousands of worried families who happen to live on a route between major cities. People are being treated like criminals simply because they happen to live at a particular point between Dublin and Cork, Dublin and Limerick or Dublin and Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent two midland counties through which we are pushing the N6 from Dublin to Galway, the N7 from Dublin to Limerick, the N8 <Col N="144" /> from Dublin to Cork and the N9 from Dublin to Waterford. These routes go through portions of my constituency of Laois-Offaly. I do not believe the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, appreciates or even knows what is going on. The high-handed and arrogant manner in which the National Roads Authority is treating public representatives and communities is to be deplored in the strongest possible terms. I call for the amendment of the legislation to ensure a greater level of accountability on the part of the NRA, a body which should, at the very least, be subjected to the rigorous examination by a select committee on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that decisions are made by the National Roads Authority without any form or adequate process being applied. A prerequisite for any decision on route selection for major motorways must be the publication of all documents, studies, reports, maps, surveys and investigations. These should be circulated to local authority representatives, county councillors and the public before any decision is made on an emerging preferred route.</P>
    <P>The practice of the National Roads Authority, behind which the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government hide, of allowing six and seven different routes to be speculated upon does no more than whip up fear and anxiety throughout the land. Adverse public opinion sets brother against brother and farmer against farmer in rural parishes. The arrogant and high-handed manner in which the authority conducts its business must now be stopped. It is unsustainable for politicians, both in this House and those at local level, to wash our hands of what is happening and cite the fact that we have no power over an authority which we set up ten or 12 years ago. Ministers hide behind the NRA as crucial matters of policy, such as the concept of pay-as-you-drive, appear not to have been the subject of debate, scrutiny or public consultation of any description. Unless and until we, as law makers, wrest the power back from the National Roads Authority, cynicism on the part of the electorate will be further fuelled and politicians will be held in even lower esteem than at present.</P>
    <P>Local public inquiries and consultations are little more than window dressing. Drawing on my experience of spending a week at a local public inquiry in a hotel in my constituency last year, I can say the inquiry was nothing more than a sham. The local inspector and his team of arrogant officials had their minds firmly made up before the process even began. If I am wrong I ask Deputy Wallace to prove me wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Government now tell us they are powerless. They are, in fact, careless as they allow actions to continue with no regard for the needs and wishes of the public who put us here. Let us call a halt to this operation as soon as we possibly can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Many speakers have dealt with the great concern in communities at the way new by-pass roads and motorways are being introduced. The system is simply dividing communities and parishes and is turning them against each other. When three or four road development options are published there is a tug of war between communities over the plans. In that way, neighbours are set against one another in an unsatisfactory manner.</P>
      <P>There are three proposals in my constituency of Galway West: the N6 to Dublin, the N17 and the N18. The N17 is the Tuam to Galway road made famous in song by the Saw Doctors. Originally when the three proposals were published for the N17 it was intended to go, more or less, along the route of the old road, by-passing Claregalway with a direct run between Tuam and Galway. Quite suddenly, however, after the three options were published and submissions made, we had a new N17 going from Tuam almost to Athenry and back into Galway. Under that proposal, people coming from Tuam would be obliged to travel eight to ten miles further on their way to Galway. Some 60% of the traffic leaving Tuam every morning is bound for Galway but under the proposed development drivers would be obliged to travel almost to Athenry and pay tolls. The proposed system is a bad one. No toll system should be introduced by the NRA on any road without the matter being debated in this House.</P>
      <P>Farmers whose land is compulsorily taken should have a share in the tolls, even if it is a small percentage, in order to compensate for the loss of their land. In that way one could bring people along with the plan instead of driving them against the developments. There would be less opposition to such an idea. The IFA has made several reasonable proposals that should be examined by the Government. There should be consultation with people instead of publishing details of four routes and then coming up with what they call &ldquo;an emerging preferred route&rdquo;. That is not consultation. Consultation is going out into the communities and saying, &ldquo;We intend to make a new road between Tuam and Athenry, or between Galway and Dublin, Now, let's talk about it and let's see how this could be done&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a new highway is driven through a parish such as Athenry, it will cut off Derrydonnell and Lisheencoyle, leaving them on the Galway side of Athenry. The best hurling parish in the country would be split in two. Half of them would communicate with Galway and the other half with Athenry. That cannot be done to communities. In recent years, we have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds planning by-passes at Claregalway, Clarinbridge and Loughrea but not a penny will ever be spent on them. Yet, millions was spent on designing those by-passes which have been abolished because of the new plans. Few of the new plans will ever come to fruition because some are just election gimmicks. Let us have consultation. There will be no bother with the farm<Col N="146" /> ing communities or anyone else if they receive a stake in what is being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The constituency of Galway East has been one of the worst affected by the proposals for these routeways. The region running east-west, from Ballinasloe to near Oranmore, and north-south from outside Tuam to Gort, is huge. Nationally, some 7,000 farmers will be affected by the proposed acquisition of 25,000 acres, but the highest proportion is within my constituency. Many communities have been seriously affected by the work of the National Roads Authority. The NRA was ill advised to bring out a questionnaire whereby, through a lobbying process, one community can change proposed routes. It was not ever intended that the proposals that are now being put on paper would work in that fashion. As Deputy Flanagan said, communities, including farmers, are being set against each other.</P>
      <P>There is a total lack of co-ordination and co-operation by the Government and the Minister to bring into the process the agencies responsible for delivering this plan. The NRA, local authorities and Dúchas are all involved in my constituency but they hardly talk to each other. Dúchas has put a stop to a road, thus necessitating an additional £10 million in order to circumvent a shed which is a habitat for bats. If bats are more important than people in County Galway, the NRA must have no sense of responsibility.</P>

Adequate compensation must be provided to landowners whose property is compulsorily acquired, particularly in areas where profitable toll roads will be operating. Investors in such PPPs will make money from them, so farmers who provide the necessary land must be adequately compensated, over and above the level of compensation for ordinary road improvements. This is a different matter and for that reason it is time for the Minister to take responsibility for it.</P>

There is a huge cohort of anxious, angry and discommoded people who either have been or will be greatly inconvenienced by what is happening. There is a huge gap in the delivery of so-called infrastructural projects. We all know there is a necessity for roads but the National Roads Authority is taking a misguided approach to the issue. As far as the NRA is concerned the answer to everything is to construct a major road in the shortest possible time, irrespective of the consequences. We hear nothing about rail, for instance.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> The craziest thing of all is just about to happen in the Tuam, Athenry and Oranmore areas of my constituency. Galway County Council spent hours rezoning land to build in a radius around Galway city so that towns such as Athenry, Tuam and Oranmore can be better linked to Gort in the south of the constituency and other towns in the north.</P>
    <P>To this day, 12 miles from Galway city, we have the remains of the Sligo-Limerick railway line that was closed down years ago. If another city in Europe had such a facility it would be upgraded and less work would be done on the roads. There should be a park-and-ride system for people to take the train into Galway, while all the towns around the city could be connected by a good railway system. I am sick and tired of having made this point for the past ten years, yet nobody seems to take a blind bit of notice.</P>
    <P>Recently, at Galway County Council we were trying to get across to the consultants that this is a balanced way of doing business.</P>
    <P>We can imagine the benefits to the community from such a development; it happened once in Tynagh with the local zinc mines. Whoever owned the land where that wealth was found was fairly well compensated. What about the farming families who have owned land for generations and which will benefit tens of thousands of motorists? They will only receive peanuts for their land. The situation is inequitable in every sense. Stakeholder farmers are being insulted by the small amount of money on offer for their land. There will have to be adequate compensation for them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this extremely important issue. Much construction work is going on and other work is promised under the national development plan. The National Roads Authority and the Government must have goodwill from the people who are being affected. Goodwill is an important issue when one starts taking away the rights of many people. An average of 3% of the total cost of roads is paid in compensation to land and property owners. Little attention is paid to the severance and serious destruction of family farms. Under the proposals, dairy farms will be destroyed along the N2 in north County Monaghan. CPO payments must be increased to a reasonable level and not paid at the current market value for agricultural land with a little extra for severance and disturbance. Real compensation must be paid if the goodwill of land and property owners is to be maintained and work allowed to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NRA and An Bord Pleanála are not answerable to the House which is a serious issue. I spoke to a builder earlier who has been trying to build 78 houses under the social housing initiative as quickly as possible. He has received two letters from An Bord Pleanála. It took eight <Col N="148" /> months for the board to make a decision on a simple rural setting and send him the first letter and it now wants another four months. We cannot question these decisions in the House. Housing for 78 families is at stake and while this is not relevant to the motion, bodies such as An Bord Pleanála are not answerable.</P>
    <P>The NRA has conducted studies of bypasses in County Monaghan for the past four years along the national primary route from Dublin to Belfast. It has spent a great deal of money, but not one sod has yet been turned. It would be better if local authorities were given the resources and allowed to use their own personnel to consult and discuss with the owners of property through which roads are planned because they could develop a closer relationship with them and a better job could be done. The NRA has this responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who is now present, and his colleagues must take this issue in hand to make sure proper compensation is paid. The N2 is a vital road as far as Counties Monaghan and Donegal and Northern Ireland are concerned. The Belfast to Galway road is equally important and it is not even included in the NDP. If something is not done to generate goodwill among property owners, the NDP will never be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the NDP the CPO process will be completed by 2001, the tender process by 2002, construction will commence in 2003 and the projects will be completed by 2006. Will the Minister of State assure the House the plan will be adhered to, irrespective of what system the Government puts in place? Can he assure us the deadline will be met?</P>
      <P>When the NDP was drawn up the Minister of State recognised that approximately 20% of funding for national roads would come from the private sector. He decided to do a Pontius Pilate. He washed his hands of responsibility and said he would not be accountable for any of the difficulties that would arise in this regard. He took two clever steps to make life easier for himself. First, he gave authority to the NRA to commission a tolls study and make the decision on whether tolls should be in place. The Ceann Comhairle can, as a result, rule out parliamentary questions in this area because the Minister of State has no responsibility for the NRA. Once again, authority is being handed over from this House to bodies such as Bord Fáilte, An Bord Pleanála and the NRA which are unelected, faceless groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, and more importantly, in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, the Minister of State ensured An Bord Pleanála would be the final arbitrator in the CPO process. I acknowledge we must have a CPO system and there must be a facility to purchase land in the interest of the common good. A few contentious CPOs have been sanctioned in County Wicklow, but, by and large, the majority of responsible politicians will <Col N="149" /> always support them if they are for the common good.</P>
    <P>The weakness regarding An Bord Pleanála is its composition. For example, in recent days planning permission for a business park costing £130 million in Bray, which had been granted by the local authority following material contravention, was overruled by An Bord Pleanála. One of the reasons was:</P>
    <P>It is considered that the additional traffic movements generated by the development as proposed would seriously prejudice the level of service and carrying capacity of the N11 and would reduce the effectiveness of public investment in the national primary route and adversely affect the use of the national road by traffic.</P>
    <P>Was the N11 not designed to facilitate projected development? According to the board's decision, it will be virtually impossible to develop a business anywhere along the N11. Decentralisation from Dublin has been discussed in recent years, yet a project which would have taken up 190 acres has been overruled by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>What is the composition of the board? My concern is that it is top heavy with planners. Are any engineers with expertise in road building on the board? At the end of the day, all these road projects will end up being appealed to the An Bord Pleanála and if planners, who have no expertise in road building, are to adjudicate on them, they will not go ahead.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>:</b> I accept, like everybody else, new roads are needed as traffic volume is increasing. However, farmers, who will suffer most as a result of these developments, should receive adequate compensation. Paying them the market rate for agricultural land will not provide them with adequate compensation. Farmers are paid 3% of the total cost of road projects, but consultants are paid more, yet they have nothing to lose. A farmer could have his farm divided in two and might find himself at a complete disadvantage when the road has been constructed depending on what type of farming he undertakes. He should not be paid for his land at the market rate for agricultural land. If the NRA copped on to the notion that farmers could hold them up and disrupt the NDP, it could deal with them in a benign way and show them that it cares about the disruption caused to them.</P>
      <P>A bypass is badly needed in Carlow and the motorway will take care of this provided it passes close to the town which is chock-a-block every weekend as people cannot get through it. I support the plea made by farmers in a responsible way. I met a farmers' delegation at the weekend. They accept roads must be built. I ask the Minister of State to sit down with the NRA and come up with a better solution than haggling about the price of agricultural land and perhaps give farmers a few extra pounds for the disruption caused to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> A road passes in front of the home of one of the farmers I spoke to at the weekend which cuts his house off from the rest of his farm. If he seeks an underpass, he will be told the cost will be deducted from the compensation he will receive. Farmers will gain the least, but must go to more bother than anybody else to obtain compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing the motion we cannot lose sight of the fundamental fact that the national road investment programme provided for in the national development plan and elaborated on in the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme and the two regional operational programmes is the largest ever undertaken in the State. The unprecedented scale of the programme brings about many challenges which are being addressed by the Government, the National Roads Authority, local authorities, the private sector and other relevant interests.</P>
      <P>Improvements are continually being made to ensure the effective and timely delivery of road projects, both national and non-national, including revision of project management guidelines, streamlining of planning procedures, the adoption of a code of practice on archaeology and greater use of consultants. At the same time, the rights of individuals and communities must be respected. The task is substantial and undoubtedly ambitious, which the debate on this motion has made clear. I will address some of the issues raised by Deputies in the House during the debate.</P>
      <P>As regards compulsory purchase orders, it is accepted that the scale of the NDP, both in terms of number and size of projects, means that CPOs will impact on a greater number of people than heretofore and to a greater extent in terms of land take. The Government is committed to ensuring that the compulsory purchase system operates efficiently and that decisions are made in a timely manner. The new procedures introduced in the Planning and Development Act, 2000, where the powers of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government were transferred to An Bord Pleanála will help in this regard. These include provision for less formal oral hearings in place of the more formal public local inquiries; the confirmation of compulsory purchase orders by local authorities where there are no objections; time limits on submitting compulsory purchase orders to the board for confirmation and an 18 week objective for making decisions on compulsory purchase orders and shortening the period within which local authorities must serve notice to treat to purchase the land from three years to 18 months. I am satisfied these changes will result in a more effective CPO system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards compensation, it is important that a balance should be struck between the public interest and the interests of individual land<Col N="151" /> owners. On the one hand, landowners have real concerns about land take issues which can impact not only on their livelihood, but on their way of life, particularly in farming communities. On the other hand, the State must ensure that value for money is obtained and that the public interest is protected in terms of the timely provision of urgently needed infrastructure. In this connection, discussions are ongoing on the Irish Farmers' Association's proposals for reform of arrangements for the compulsory acquisition of land, including the issue of compensation. These discussions are between the IFA, my Department and other relevant agencies, including the National Roads Authority. It is important to remember that the road investment programme should be delivered on time and in a cost effective, yet fair and reasonable manner so that the whole country can enjoy sustained economic growth and a more balanced regional development. We accept that the needs of individual families and how they are being affected must and will be fully taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Tolling was discussed in some detail during the debate and was addressed at some length by the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, in the House last night. It is important to remember that tolling is an integral part of the proposed public private partnership arrangements which will deliver significant benefits in the rolling out of the roads investment programme. Essential skills and finance will be harnessed through PPPs to ensure that the road network is built to the highest standards and in the most efficient manner. Being a relatively new concept in Ireland, particularly outside Dublin, it is inevitable that it will attract opposition. It will take some time for the concept to be fully accepted.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the stretches of road on which tolls are proposed are spread geographically throughout the country so that one area is not bearing the brunt of tolls. It has also been clearly stated that motorists will have a choice whether to used the tolled route. Alternative non-tolled routes will still be available to those who choose not to use the new road. Tolls will be set at a rate which is economically viable. It is reasonable that the private sector will seek to attract motorists to use the tolled facility and that tolls will not be set at a level which will discourage motorists. Furthermore, as indicated previously, a comprehensive statutory consultation process will be carried out under the Roads Act, 1993, before tolling is introduced on a route and the community will have an opportunity to raise any concerns or objections. Shadow tolling is not in prospect, at least in the short-term, as hard tolls more readily permit the transfer of economic risk. Moreover, hard tolls are more equitable than shadow tolls as those who do not use the tolled roads are not required to subsidise those who do.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the Government's desire to deliver urgently on the major roads infrastructure iden<Col N="152" /> tified in the NDP. The Government is also concerned for those who are affected by such developments. A careful balance must be struck between these concerns both in terms of the statutory procedures which apply and those arrangements and procedures which operate outside the statutory sphere. The Government is constantly striving to improve our system of public administration as it impacts on individuals and I put it to the House that the arrangements for consulting local communities, acquiring land and improving our road system, looked at in the round, are fair and reasonable to individuals and also in terms of serving the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Bradford and Olivia Mitchell.</P>
      <P>It seems an effrontery for the Government to table an amendment to this motion which talks about extensive non-statutory consultations by road authorities, land acquisitions being fair and reasonable and a system providing for appropriate compensation. As regards consultations, the Minister of State referred to discussions between his Department and the NRA, on the one hand, and the IFA, on the other hand. The clear impression the other participants in those discussions have is that they are heard but not listened to. There is no reaction from the official side to the proposals made. That has also been the experience of local communities throughout the country where they can get access to talk to the NRA.</P>
      <P>Given the volume of work now being undertaken and the amounts of land being taken up by the roads programme, it is clear the CPO procedure as it stands, with all its delays and uncertainties, is entirely inappropriate. It is also clear the assessment of what constitutes appropriate compensation is woefully inadequate. Not more than 1% of the entire agricultural area of this country comes on the market for sale each year. It is a seller's market. In the space of four years the national primary roads programme will take up the equivalent of a quarter of that amount of land. In the space of four years it will add 25% to the volume of land coming on the market. That cannot fail to fuel the upward march in prices to a significant extent. It would be impossible for many of the farmers who will be affected by this roads programme to purchase land to replace the land compulsorily acquired. They will not be able to find land within any reasonable distance of their existing farms at a price which will match the amount of compensation they get paid for compulsorily acquired land. Appropriate compensation must be fundamentally re-thought in the context of that one fact. In view of this and that this conversion of land assets to money is entirely compulsory and not at the choice of the farmers concerned, there is an unanswerable case for compensation for CPOs to be completely relieved of capital gains tax, whatever use the recipient makes of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="153" />
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for sharing his time with me. I welcome and support the motion. I will speak about the tolling of roads as outlined in the agreement for the 11 new planned routes throughout the country. Everyone in this House welcomes the development and expansion of a top grade road network. There is a role for public private partnerships. However, I express grave disquiet at the strong possibility that tolls will be imposed on these 11 routes, which are being built by public private partnerships.</P>
      <P>One of those projects, the Fermoy bypass, is in my constituency. The community of Fermoy has strongly argued for the development of a bypass. Many people in this House and tens of thousands of people throughout the country know that the town of Fermoy urgently needs a bypass. The traffic through the town is horrific every day. The community in Fermoy was pleased when the decision was made to build a bypass. However, the community is now stunned and shocked to learn that a toll will be placed on the Fermoy bypass adjacent to the town. The traffic the Fermoy bypass was designed to take out of the town will now go back through it because the bypass will be tolled. I was interested to hear the Minister of State say that motorists will have a choice. In our discussions with the National Roads Authority we were advised that motorists would have a choice. The Taoiseach said in the House yesterday afternoon that he favoured the introduction of by-laws which would force motorists to use the bypass and toll bridges. That would remove the choice for motorists. We need clarification on that issue. It does not make sense to toll a bypass. We are not talking about the Cork Dublin motorway but about the Fermoy bypass. No one can justify tolling it. Bypasses of provincial towns and cities in Britain or in Europe are not tolled. This should be examined in detail.</P>
      <P>When compared with the income generated by tolls, the statistics on the costs of these projects paint a very grave picture. This, too, must be addressed. The 11 tolling projects being sanctioned by the Government will become a gold mine for those investing in tolling projects. How much taxpayer's money will end up being spent on improving our road network? The House has never held a proper debate on the provision of these proposed tolling projects, every one which should be the subject of a full debate. We need to hear what the Minister and his departmental colleagues have to say to justify them.</P>
      <P>I see no reason a bypass of a provincial town needs to be tolled. It does not make economic sense, nor does it make sense from a traffic point of view. If the project in Fermoy goes ahead as a tolling project, the town's traffic problems, which we have been trying to solve for the past ten to 15 years, will increase. I ask the Minister to re-examine it. He should reconsider the whole concept of tolling and the various projects being built under the public-private partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motorist and taxpayer will have to hand over money to the tolling companies. Although I <Col N="154" /> appreciate that some of the profits will come back by way of levy, the vast majority will not be spent on Irish roads. They will leave the country, which is a nonsensical prospect. I welcome the opportunity to start the debate on the necessity and justification for tolling our roads, particularly bypasses. However, it is vital that we have a much longer debate before any decisions are taken to toll bypasses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In concluding the debate I reiterate that the motivation behind the motion is solely to ensure the speedy delivery of the national road network and identify the barriers to achieving this network emerging throughout the country. Had the Minister been present last night and most of tonight, he would have heard Deputy after Deputy from both the Government and Opposition benches recounting sorry tales of their experiences on this issue. In nearly every area affected by a road proposal there are distraught and anxious communities banding together in opposition to it. Excluding the Dublin area, there are already 24 different anti-road groups throughout the country.</P>
      <P>A Government Deputy said yesterday that there are always objectors. Every public representative is aware of this, but we are talking about almost unanimous opposition from communities which have spent years lobbying for these roads. They have switched to opposing it virtually overnight. With this kind of opposition one would need to be an ostrich to deny something is wrong with the way in which the process is proceeding, particularly the method by which communities are consulted. If the Government and the NRA proceed in this vein, every single project will end up in the courts, thus ensuring they take longer and cost more. Ultimately, nobody will be happy. Not even motorists will feel they have been well served by the State.</P>
      <P>I will not repeat what I said last night or what others have said since. However, a number of common points thread all the comments on the issue. Contrary to what the Minister said, the public consultation process is a farce in practice. Far from encouraging communities to support the projects by giving them a sense of ownership, it antagonises the very people it seeks to persuade. The secrecy and the grudgingly given information mentioned already in the debate have been bad enough, but the dishonesty of pretending that multiple route options are available is absolutely outrageous. Not only do these tactics incense the public, but people are becoming increasingly suspicious and disaffected because they are being taken for fools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The random method of route selection has to stop. The public craves honest information. It would be far more honest and productive if the NRA told people up front which route it had opted for. At least people could then get answers to the detailed questions they have about roads which will affect their property and lives. If the early consultation process is not changed and the <Col N="155" /> NRA proceeds instead with the tactics in which it is currently engaged, it will be on a hiding to nothing. The road network will never be delivered.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the current CPO procedure has not changed since 1919. It is archaic, cumbersome, tortuously slow, rigid and grossly unfair. It is about as inflexible, inappropriate and adversarial a system as one could possibly contrive. The roads programme in coming years will require the acquisition of 25,000 acres of land affecting at least 8,000 individuals. If we embark on this process using the current CPO procedure, we will still not complete it until the 22nd century.</P>
    <P>The procedure, which comprises 18 steps, sometimes leaves landowners in a state of limbo for years. They do not know when their land will be taken, how much they will be paid for it or what impact it will have on their home, business or farm. In addition, their land is virtually valueless during the CPO process because no one will buy land under a CPO. Sometimes a person's circumstances change and he or she have to sell their land. Possibly the most offensive aspect of CPO is that landowners are not told the precise figure they will receive. Sometimes they are not informed until after the land has gone. This is hardly a democratic arrangement.</P>
    <P>I do not want to revisit the compensation issue that my colleagues addressed other than to say that the rules are so rigid that the compensation bears no relation to the loss incurred by the landowner. A further anomaly arises where the land purchased is for a toll road, which is the case in <Col N="156" /> 11 of these projects. In those circumstances the land immediately acquires development value which transfers to the private toll company while the poor unfortunate farmer, who has been forced to relinquish his land and means of production, is paid an agricultural price for the land. This is grossly unfair and must be changed.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to go over the points that my colleagues addressed so well, in particular the sleight of hand by which we woke up one morning to find that half the roads are to be tolled. Having been informed that the private sector was to be involved in the provision of the national road network, that involvement became synonymous with private road tolling overnight. This has never been justified using economic, or any other kind of, rationale. According to the Minister, the matter is now completely out of our hands. He better get back into the Dáil. He may believe that he will get away with this, but I assure him he will not.</P>
    <P>Every Member of the House and every member of the public recognises that the need to upgrade our national road infrastructure is in the national interest. Inevitably State agencies will be biased towards achieving this goal, but it comes at a huge private cost to individuals and communities. It is the responsibility of the State to take all reasonable steps to protect those affected by new roads and compensate those forced to give up their land. This is not happening and if the Government does not heed what has been said by all sides over the last two nights, it will have a revolution on its hands that will make it impossible to build any roads.</P>

      <P>My contribution is based on the value of removing the dual mandate. Elected representatives would benefit from its removal due to the increasing workload involved in serving at local and national level. Its removal would enhance democracy and result in the provision of better service for the public. However, I firmly believe that some provision should be made for Oireachtas Members to receive reports or sit in as observers at local authority meetings. I intend to table an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage. The majority of representations I receive concern local issues and unless we are privy to local authority information, we will be powerless in getting answers for constituents. There are some 20 Oireachtas Members from Cork and some 46 county councillors. Significant demands are placed on planners, engineers, county managers etc. to whom public representatives make representations and with whom they are in contact on a daily basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the recent report of the Ombudsman on local authorities. The report was quite critical of the service provided for the public and while I agree with this to a certain extent, we must bear in mind that local authorities are <Col N="159" /> grossly understaffed and that those trying to provide services labour under very heavy workloads and pressures. Planners in Cork County Council only take telephone calls between 9.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. in order to have an opportunity to make a dent in their workloads. As an elected representative, even I cannot arrange a meeting with them or contact them by telephone. The Ombudsman's criticism should be viewed in this context.</P>
    <P>The provisions in regard to payment, the dual mandate and the direct election of a cathaoirleach are probably the three main elements of the Bill. I am not particularly opposed to mayors or cathaoirleachs being directly elected. I would welcome such people being elected by the public on the basis of their manifestos. However, I have serious concerns about the limited nature of the powers proposed in the Bill for the position of cathaoirleach. It would be impossible for anybody elected to the position to fulfil his or her mandate or have the level of powers which would be expected of him or her by the public.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill cathaoirleachs can propose a person for a civic honour and be informed by the manager of overspending. From 2004 they will be entitled to chair city or county development boards and the corporate policy group. Where the corporate policy group requests a report from the manager on any matter relating to a local authority function, the cathaoirleach may direct the manager to refrain from acting in the matter for a period up to two months. The cathaoirleach can require the manager to furnish information and request councillors appointed to any external body to report on its activities. These functions are very limited and would not fulfil people's expectations of the powers which should be held by directly elected chairmen.</P>
    <P>The Bill, while it contains some worthwhile elements such as those to which I referred, certainly does not represent the total reform of local government which is, in many cases, creaking at the seams and deserves far more attention than it receives in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Clune for sharing her time. Local government in Ireland has a proud history. Since 1898 the system of local democracy has been well served by dedicated officials and councillors. Successive Governments have acknowledged the importance of local government to the citizen and, on many occasions, advocated reform of the system. Fianna Fáil's claim in its 1997 election manifesto that it would abolish rates ensured local sources of financial power were eliminated. This was the beginning of a retrograde step for councillors' decision making powers and their powers in regard to discretionary finances were irrevocably diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication in 1996 by the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Howlin, of a document entitled, Towards <Col N="160" /> Better Local Government, indicated that some changes could be forthcoming. The delays experienced in establishing the SPCs and achieving agreement among trade unions and the absence of reform in the delivery of services generated frustration among councillors and officials alike and created the perception that local government is no longer geared to responding to changing demands in a time of major economic growth.</P>
    <P>I record my appreciation of the tremendous work carried out by the General Council of County Councils and the Local Authority Members Association. I commend them on meeting departmental officials and Oireachtas Members in an effort to modify the Bill's provisions to make local government more meaningful for members of the public.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, made many promises in An Action Programme for the Millennium, contingent on Fianna Fáil being returned to power in 1997. He stated he would remove the democratic deficit by restoring real power to elected members. He regularly criticises county managers and the county management Act of 1940, but has done nothing to provide an alternative vision or improved structure. Under the recent Waste Management (Amendment) Bill he decreased elected members' power and gave more power to managers. Managers will make decisions on local waste management plans, irrespective of the views of councillors.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the Minister seeks to create a new layer of bureaucracy between managers and elected members with his proposal for directly elected cathaoirleachs but fails to indicate whether any additional powers will be accorded to these new office holders. In his contribution on the Bill he indicated that a mayor or chairperson could nominate people for civic honours and entertain visiting guests.</P>
    <P>I question the Minister's commitment to local government as he was so out of touch that he could not understand the furore in Kilkenny in regard to the definition of &ldquo;cities&rdquo; in Schedule 5 to the Bill. How could he be so out of touch in regard to the pride, status, symbolism and heritage enshrined in the corporations of Kilkenny, Sligo, Clonmel, Wexford and Drogheda? I compliment the five mayors who waged a major campaign to force the Minister to give a commitment to retain the status of these corporations in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, will indicate whether an amendment will be introduced on Committee Stage to ensure the commitment given by the Minister and the Taoiseach will be upheld. I compliment Councillor Cuddihy, Lord Mayor of Kilkenny, who was to the forefront in representing the people of Kilkenny city and county in this campaign.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny was established as a town in 1230 and granted city status by King James I in 1609. I acknowledge that in Cromwell's aftermath the status of many places, Kilkenny included, was uncertain. However, Kilkenny received a second <Col N="161" /> city charter in 1687 from King James II. A royal charter signed by Queen Victoria in 1862 refers to the city of Kilkenny. I want the status of the city of Kilkenny acknowledged by the Government on Second Stage tonight.</P>
    <P>The issue of the dual mandate has generated controversy, particularly with independent Deputies. I want the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Wallace, to be forthright and honest with the House as to whether the relevant section is to remain in the Bill. There have been many meetings during the day as well as some indication as to the attitude of the Independents and the Government to the legislation. We want to know tonight, before we vote on Second Stage tomorrow, what is the Government's intention. If the section is deleted, it will be another political slap in the face for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and a massive U-turn given his stubbornness to leave the section in the legislation. It will make his position untenable. He has had a number of very bad experiences in proposing legislation and having to climb down and were the section deleted it would be the biggest climb-down of all.</P>
    <P>He should realise that his record as Minister for the Environment and Local Government is not a good one. Numerous legal cases are being taken against him in the European Union on issues such as water quality and waste management. We have the worst record in Europe on greenhouse gas emissions and nothing proactive has been done to achieve EU objectives on recycling of waste, even though the target is that 60% of domestic waste must be recycled by each member state in the next five years. The Minister promised efficiency in the local government system, but staff are leaving for the private sector on a weekly basis, particularly from the planning sections. He has delayed, or been forced to delay, this legislation for two years. He has also been forced to backtrack on the Electoral Bill and the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001. His impractical approach to the Planning and Development Act, 2000, ensures there will be a reduction of some 6,000 housing starts this year alone. Builders and developers are finding it exceptionally difficult to get the necessary approvals from financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has talked a lot and spent £1.6 million on public relations since becoming Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I can only conclude that public relations companies have done their bit dealing with a difficult product. The Minister's tenure of office, particularly if he has backtracked on the dual mandate, will go down as a political failure. Having come in with a gung-ho approach, he will go out with a whimper.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with most Members of the House, <Col N="162" /> and of the Seanad, I am a member of a local authority and have been for almost 16 years. The reason I stood for election in 1985 was that I believed I could get much needed things done which local councillors were unwilling or unable to tackle. The first thing I learned on being elected was that it was not quite that simple. The standard reply for a number of years to every question tabled by any councillor regardless of party was that a request would be considered in the context of priorities in the following year's estimates. Very foolishly, or naïvely, I asked a senior council official how I could ensure traffic lights at a very dangerous junction in the area I represented would become a priority. He sneered and suggested that it was for him to know and me to find out. That was the way I experienced local government in the early years.</P>
    <P>I am aware from the Bill that estimates will be replaced with budgets, but &ndash; this is not clear from the legislation &ndash; unless budgets are presented in a simpler, more easily understood format, councillors will have little or no control over how money is being spent within their local authority areas. I may not be an accountant, but I am certainly no fool. Estimates of expenditure as they are presented, and have been presented up until this year, are double Dutch to most councillors and will remain so. I therefore urge the Minster to ensure budgets for local authorities are designed and presented to their members in a form that is easily understood. Things have changed and managers and staff are much more amenable to being helpful. In the early years I remember, as a member of Dublin County Council, attempting to establish estimates committees, but there was no way it would be entertained. They have had them in Dublin Corporation and certainly managers have been helpful to councillors in ensuring expenditure is incurred in the way councillors want.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on salaries for councillors which ties in to the issue of the dual mandate. Regardless of what we say, most of those elected to county councils see themselves as aspiring TDs and want to go on to the Dáil and Seanad. If we do not enlarge the work of local authorities, this will always be the case. Much comment has been made on the position of the independent Members and their opinions regarding the dual mandate. During the lengthy debate within the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party I supported the abolition of the dual mandate, but was in a minority. If there are changes to the Bill, I urge Members on the other side of the House not to presume it is because Independents have called for them. There may be much opposition on this side as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>If the dual mandate is to be abolished, I have requested that the Minister look favourably at the right of Deputies to attend council meetings and submit questions. They <Col N="163" /> would not vote as they would not have been elected, but that would be a way to expand the role of a Deputy within local government while abolishing the dual mandate.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome, thought it is not specified in the Bill, that local councillors will be paid. For many years after I was elected I was working in the home and did not have an independent income. I remember my husband asking if it was costing us money and it was. It costs every local councillor an amount of money to do their job properly. In Dublin if one wants to run for the Dáil or hold on to one's local council seat, one is marking a Deputy in the area and certainly issuing a substantial amount of circulars. This is all done at one's own cost. I did it at the expense of the only income earner in my home and it took him a while to realise it. Councillors will be very glad to see this provision put in place.</P>
      <P>I do not know if directly elected mayors, or cathaoirligh as they will be called, will make much difference given the limited powers provided for them. However, the five year mandate is worthwhile and I welcome the fact that the cathaoirleach will be disqualified from election as a Dáil candidate while he or she holds office and for a 12 month period thereafter. This is good and innovative and marks a separation of local authority members from Dáil candidates.</P>
      <P>Section 52 allows for joint committees of two or more local authorities. Some local authorities have been very proactive. When I was a member of Dublin County Council we had a joint management committee for the Liffey Valley which straddled Fingal and south Dublin. It withered on the vine because management was opposed to it and meetings would have to be cancelled. If such committees are established, they must achieve their objective.</P>
      <P>When I stood for election in Dublin in 1985 the major source of reform of local government was the Barrington report. Were it not for it I would not have been elected as a local councillor. It substantially increased the number of seats in the Dublin local authorities' area. One of the buzzwords during that period was subsidiarity. Power was to be devolved and I suppose we believed that, though perhaps I have more experience of local government now. The Minister said the delivery of functions such as policing, public transport, health and social welfare comes within the local government system in some other countries but that if we were realistic, in the short-term in our circumstances these would not be subsumed within local government nor would there be such a demand, much as we might wish there were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister is saying, and he is right to a certain degree, is that even when local councillors make brilliant presentations to Ministers for the Environment &ndash; and I have been one of those councillors &ndash; looking for such functions, local councillors often do not use the functions they already have and are afraid to make decisions. <Col N="164" /> The Minister has pragmatically and rightly recognised that if other functions were to be devolved to local government, members would probably not exercise the powers given to them. If we did that we might see local government becoming completely separate from the Dáil and Seanad. However, I understand the reasoning: we do not exercise the powers we have. Local government is seen as just stopping things, which we tend to do. We want the power without the responsibility.</P>
    <P>The new system of local government is built on partnership and the SPCs are a main plank in that. We will have a function regarding policy, although we may have always had that function and we did not know it. Part IX sets out the functions of local authorities and states that it is to provide a forum for the democratic representation of the local community and to provide civic leadership. I have highlighted the fact that sometimes we are lacking when it comes to giving that civic leadership. Part IX goes on to say that we should take action to promote community interests. That may give ammunition to protest groups to direct local councillors to do what they want. I know regarding a particular issue in my area that that was cited as our function: to promote community interests. We have not broadened the scope and function of local government enough to get that separation and to allow the dual mandate to wither on the vine but there is a great deal in this Bill which I welcome and support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a substantial Bill. It consolidates local government legislation to date, it gives legislative recognition to many existing provisions for local government and it proposes a number of new reforms. The recent result in the Nice treaty referendum demonstrates clearly the view of the people that government institutions on international, national and local levels must be open, transparent and accountable. In short, they must be democratic and responsive to the real needs of people. That is what this Bill is about as far as local government structures are concerned.</P>
      <P>The people recently voted for the specific recognition of local government in our Constitution by inserting Article 28A in Bunreacht na hÉireann. This decision alone compels all Members to ensure that local government operates effectively and efficiently in the interests of all citizens.</P>
      <P>Local administration in Ireland consists of local government bodies which are part of the local government system or which are closely allied to it. Those bodies are the local authorities, which are well known and understood, but also the regional assemblies, regional authorities, county and city development boards, health boards, regional tourism authorities, vocational education committees, central and regional fisheries boards, harbour authorities, county enterprise boards, Leader groups and partnership companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these bodies were established recently by the Minister as part of his ongoing programme <Col N="165" /> of reform, while others are well known and established. It is important that the newer bodies put mechanisms in place to ensure that a so-called democratic deficit does not emerge. They must engage fully with the public they serve and ensure that they operate in a democratic manner.</P>
    <P>The Bill stipulates that local government elections must be held every five years and cannot be deferred. This is welcome as what happened in the past was outrageous. The frightening reality is that nobody really noticed or cared when local government elections were deferred in the past. That is the real challenge of this Bill: to ensure that the public participates fully in the local government process.</P>
    <P>I fully support the proposal in the Bill for a directly elected mayor or chairperson. An election for this position would be keenly contested and would bring about greater public participation in local government generally. A directly elected mayor or chairperson, with a mandate from the people, would be a respected figure and would be a powerful force for change and development. At present this office is largely ceremonial and terms of office are generally for one year. This gives the unelected city or county manager a greater role and effectively puts him or her in the driving seat. The lord mayor or local authority chairperson has a key role in ensuring that the council and its committees operate effectively and efficiently. He or she has a leadership role, especially after a new council has been elected. Therefore the lord mayor or chairperson must have some experience in public administration or public life at national or local level. I understand the Minister said something in this regard and may return to the matter on Committee Stage to ensure that that is the case.</P>
    <P>The mayor or chairperson should also be adequately paid. From my experience in Dublin, the lord mayor is an extremely busy person. It is a full time job dealing with half a million people and if we are to attract people of the right calibre the income should be set somewhere between the income of a Minister and that of a Minister of State. As other speakers have said, if we opt for directly elected mayors or chairpersons, more powers will have to be devolved to local government. That would be essential for local democracy generally.</P>
    <P>In principle I favour the abolition of the dual mandate. This is something we should work towards, as local government is now a very complex area. It can be difficult, though not impossible, to do both jobs effectively. Nevertheless, if we are to achieve this a major change in the political culture of the country is needed. In their hearts and souls the electorate still wants Deputies to be available locally and to attend to local matters. Their legislative role, important as it is, is still seen as secondary, which is unfortunate, though the results of elections demonstrate this. Before we abolish the dual mandate it would be in our interests to initiate a comprehensive education of the electorate regarding the differ<Col N="166" /> ent roles played by Deputies and councillors in the political system. The Bill and its proposed reforms make up the first step in that process.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing away with the term &ldquo;alderman&rdquo;, which is a mistake. That is a tradition peculiar to this country and I see no good reason to do away with the term. It is a keenly contested title in the cities and we should not do away with it in the interests of tradition and local government generally.</P>
    <P>The strategic policy committees are given statutory recognition in the Bill but they are not working properly. Management is not committed to real partnership in decision-making through these committees. Management tends to dictate the agenda of these committees and is not responsive to ideas from the membership. If we are to give statutory recognition to the SPCs we need to deal with that problem and to think it out more to ensure that is not the case in the future. Local government has, on occasion, failed the citizens. In the Dublin area in particular, the taxi issue is an example. Insufficient taxis were available and local government did not deal with the problem effectively. Central Government had to step in. The local authorities are also failing to deal with the issue of waste management. Again, central Government must step in here. It has brought forward the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001, which I fully support.</P>
    <P>Local government has faced major challenges in the past in housing, sewerage and public water supply. Local authorities dealt with these matters effectively. However, we have had our failures in relation to taxis and waste management. We need to be conscious that from time to time central Government will have to step in to deal with problems which are not being tackled at local level.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill for salaries for local authority members. It is a recognition of the work which local authority members do. I fully support the position in relation to ethics. Revelations from the Flood tribunal make such provisions in the Bill very relevant. It is interesting to note that we will no longer have the famous and much abused section 4 motions throughout the local government system. The section dealing with this issue will now be section 139. We will have to get used to the new terminology and I hope the new section 139 will not be abused in the way the old section 4 was.</P>
    <P>Local authorities need to be increasingly responsive, customer orientated and less bureaucratic; that is the tone of this Bill. Section 225 deals with reclaimed land and the position in relation to planning permission. I oppose the application by Dublin Port for the infill of 52 acres of Dublin Bay. Section 225 will be relevant to that and I have no doubt Dublin Corporation will refuse planning permission when the effective legal framework is in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Dukes. I am far from satisfied with the <Col N="167" /> main thrust of this Bill. It proposes to give more power to local councils and local councillors and I would welcome that if that were to happen. However, I have been in local government for a long time and am a county councillor. I have severe reservations about the thought that lies at the back of this Bill. I find it very difficult to understand that tonight, the day before the Bill goes on to its next stage, a Minister would try to con this House into believing he is on the side of local democracy. In fairness to the Minister, I have heard him talk on this subject for many years, and before he was a Minister. He gives the impression that there is little about local government that he does not know. Perhaps he is right. However, what people do in opposition is very different to what they do when in power.</P>
      <P>If one was to take this Bill at face value, it is hard to see much wrong with it. However, next week in this House, in front of the same Minister, we are to have another Bill that will over-rule 30 Galway councillors of every shade of opinion, from every location in the county. These are 30 people who would literally not join each other in saying the rosary, or on any other topic other than waste management. On two occasions in Galway County Council they have unanimously refused to pass the Connacht waste management plan for a variety of excellent reasons. Everyone except the Minister would appear to be wrong on this issue at the minute.</P>
      <P>The same Minister tells the House tonight that he is in favour of local democracy. When I see what is happening I take this with a grain of salt. I hope to get the opportunity of speaking further when the Bill comes back to the House, but it is a most draconian measure and the greatest attack on local government in several generations. I will fight it tooth and nail the next day the Bill is in the House because it is an insult to me and my 29 colleagues on Galway County Council, and members of several other councils.</P>
      <P>The news around the House this evening is that the dual mandate as contained in this Bill will be withdrawn tomorrow. I do not know if that is true but, usually, the voices are not wrong on such matters. If that is the case I find it difficult to understand what is going on in the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party. It takes only Deputy Healy-Rae to overturn the whole thing. To bring legislation to the House, the Minister must have the backing of his party and it must be Government policy, which I assume this was. The situation is similar to the Nice treaty referendum result. The Government failed to deliver. It could not deliver then and it obviously cannot deliver on this matter either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Morally, the Government is bankrupt. If it is decided through a party machine and through Government that a measure is to be implemented in the House, and then at the final moment the most important leg of the stool is pulled out from underneath, the Government is on a very weak wicket. It is time to ask who runs this Govern<Col N="168" /> ment. I hope the Minister in his reply will let us know whether this part of the legislation is to be withdrawn tomorrow. Members deserve to know. If the Minister set out to help local authorities &ndash; and I assume that was the basis of this Bill &ndash; then I agree with the principle that councillors should be paid. They have been used as a mud-splasher for years. Theirs has not been a nice position in community life. They deserve what they are to get. I am amazed that it took so long to bring this measure in but I hope that, at least, it will go through tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by repeating an old grievance of mine. I have consulted Standing Orders, particularly the provisions of paragraph 3 of Standing Order 111, under which interventions in this House on the Second Stage of a Bill are limited to 20 minutes for Members other than Ministers. That is a totally anti-democratic provision. To properly discuss a Bill of this size in 20 minutes is an impossibility. Any Member of this House with a real interest in local government, and who is not a member of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, is seriously constrained in what he or she can say on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me to be reminded what Government was in power when the Whips agreed to that. However, it is fundamentally anti-democratic and was a piece of this mindless political correctness that we give in to far too often in the House. We should have the confidence in ourselves to believe that if a Deputy has something to say, he or she should have the time to say it. I do not take the view that I got elected to keep my mouth shut and I would like to see the back of that Standing Order. I have little hope that I will be in a position to do that in the near future, but perhaps some day, common sense will break through and overcome this nonsensical political correctness.</P>
      <P>To come to the Bill, I agree with Deputy Connaughton that the claim of the Government that the Bill is part of one element of a broad programme of measures for the renewal of local government is entirely spurious. Members of local authorities have, in law, the power to settle their policies. This is repeated in section 129. However, the role of local authorities is very restricted in practice. Neither individual councillors nor groups of councillors have the resources or the backup required to play a full part in determining local authority policy. In practice, the power rests with the city or county managers. As long as this is the case, we will not have true democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to have a directly elected cathaoirleach who might and is most likely to have no connection with any group and possibly no experience of local government. Faced with the existing management structures, this popularly elected cathaoirleach will have no real power, although public expectation will be different. This is not a criticism of any local authority <Col N="169" /> manager or local authority managers in general. It is far from it because they are also seriously under-resourced. Successive Governments in successive and ill-judged so-called reforms of local government have added new functions to, and have made new demands of, local authorities without a commensurate allocation of resources.</P>
    <P>Although section 129 solemnly states what are the powers of councillors, I defy any Member in the House to say with a straight face that it is councillors who decide the policy of the local authority having examined the operations of any local authority. Meeting after meeting councillors are faced with a large bundle of documents containing a series of proposals that they do not have time to read, let alone digest. They are told the proposals have to be passed before a certain time or the Minister, or the county manager, will do the job for them.</P>
    <P>Most county councils make the decisions recommended to them by the county managers. As I said, I am not criticising county mangers. I know many of them and they are, largely, upstanding people who provide a good and dedicated service for their communities. However, the law, which states that it is councillors who make the policy and managers who execute it, is just a fiction. I am not accusing councillors of incompetence in saying they merely rubber stamp the policies made by the managers. As long as this is the case, the Bill will not be part of any programme of measures for the renewal of local government. We will not have local democracy as we are supposed to have it. We have only the appearance of local democracy &ndash; the reality is very different.</P>
    <P>Recent high growth rates in the economy, which we are delighted to see, have caused a boom in construction and infrastructure provision generally. Local authorities have been severely restricted in their ability to respond to emerging demands. Not least of their problems has been the very tardy adoption of information technology in the local government system.</P>
    <P>Infrastructure provision was discussed in the House earlier. Those who think or pretend that the local authority system is doing its job must ask themselves the reason the Government has apparently been converted to public-private partnerships. The Government has had several Pauline conversions on its road to Damascus. Some time ago it would never have dreamed of selling off a State asset. Now, it is talking about a car-boot sale of Aer Lingus. It is a Government which would never have dreamed of allowing a bank in national ownership to pass into private ownership, but it later tried to put three banks together and sell them off. The Government would never have accepted that the private sector had any contribution to make to public infrastructure, but what is happening is that it is touting public-private partnerships as a way of getting roads built quickly. We know this is not the case. It is doing it not because of a conversion to the more liberal economic doctrines of its smaller partners, but because it knows our local authority <Col N="170" /> system cannot handle the volume of work that needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The Bill, like many of its ill-judged predecessors, adds new obligations to local authorities at a time when they are coping with the formidable challenge of drawing up housing programmes to comply with the provisions of last year's Local Government (Planning and Development) Act. In addition to this, the Bill requires them to prepare a corporate plan &ndash; more politically correct rubbish being foisted on them. This plan must be prepared in addition to the county development plan. On top of this, they have to prepare a rolling three year capital programme as if it were not part of a county development plan or a proper corporate plan. County development plans spawn a series of town and area action plans, all of which require close and detailed attention by the manager, his staff and councillors.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are being told to do all these extra things and I am not sure anybody has thought out their function. Local authorities will now spend virtually all their time making plans and no time doing anything constructive. Is any Minister prepared to acknowledge what we are heaping upon local authorities and ask if it contributes one jot to human health, wealth and happiness, which should be the proper job of local authorities? Local authorities are being buried in bureaucracy and drowned in plans, thus making it difficult for them to provide the infrastructure and services people expect. The net result is that our local government system is becoming inefficient through over-burdening.</P>
    <P>We have planning departments throughout the country which are unable to cope, partly because they cannot keep staff. I am sure all Members have had the experience of finally making a connection with the relevant, responsible person in the planning department of a local authority only to find that he or she was gone in a few months having been headhunted by the private sector which can afford to pay them better. Local authorities are engaged in an unequal contest with the private sector. I am not accusing anybody of bad faith, but the local authorities simply cannot keep pace. The result is that an increasing number of matters are being kicked upstairs to An Bord Pleanála and everyone becomes more frustrated.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the partnership model <i>via</i> strategic policy committees. I know such committees are not an invention of the current Government; they were invented by a previous Administration. I did not like them at that stage and I do not like them now. This is not because I object to proper consultation with the people, quite the contrary. I ask the Government to consider what is being done. We have gradually reduced the power of councillors and their ability to respond to the communities they represent.</P>
    <P>We have taken away councillors' powers and they now cannot add new expenditure or programmes &ndash; they cannot even shift expenditure. <Col N="171" /> As a result, communities have become completely disenchanted with councillors and the entire system of politics. On recognising this, the Government, instead of seeking the root cause looks for a politically correct response to it. The politically correct response to such disenchantment is not to give councillors the resources to do their job, but to make them directly available to community groups. Councillors who have for many years been trying to get things done are finding that community groups no longer need to consult them because they can obtain funding through any other of the myriad other programmes we operate. We are surprised that people are fed up and becoming cynical and sceptical about the value of our political system, when we deliberately set out to undermine it by not giving councillors adequate powers. In addition, we deliberately undermined it from the other side by giving other people greater powers to deliver. That is nonsense and any Bill that rests in part on that kind of process is doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>Will we obtain a reply tonight in respect of question about the dual mandate? Has anyone in the Government ever considered whether it would be constitutional to do what the Minister proposed to do? Is it constitutional to say that membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas constitutes a disability in law from being a candidate for election to a local authority? Is it constitutional to inform a Member of this House &ndash; for the numerous reasons that have been put forward, including the fact that we are very busy &ndash; that he or she has a job to do here and, therefore, cannot seek another job with a county council? Is it acceptable to inform a person who might be the managing director or financial manager of a company, a farmer, a self-employed auctioneer, etc., that it does not matter how busy they might be in their occupation, they are entitled to serve as a councillor? What sense does that make?</P>
    <P>I know it is not politically correct to say this and I should not do so, but sometimes the truth must come out. If we have seen the end of that provision &ndash; I do not know to whom the thanks for this are due, it could be Deputy Healy-Rae or someone else &ndash; that would not be a bad development. I agree with the Government if it intends to give a different kind of mandate to councillors. I can foresee the day when, if we are serious about local government, councillors will be full-time, elected, properly paid officials. If the Government wants to proceed in this manner, it should do so and should not present us with a rag such as this Bill.</P>

      <P>This appears to be a major Bill and it is certainly large enough. It is probably the most wide-ranging legislation which has appeared <Col N="172" /> for a long period and I hoped it would have been fundamental in nature. However, that is not the case. Perhaps it will prove otherwise when the Committee Stage debate commences.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of discussion in the Bill about enhancing the role of public representatives. I do not see how the Bill will achieve this and it has certainly not been achieved in recent years. I have been a member of a local authority since 1985 and the powers and the role of public representatives has been continuously run down. I would hate to set out on a career as a councillor now because the local authority system is not as good as it was 15 or 16 years ago and it is much more difficult for new arrivals to make a meaningful input.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of discussion on the part of the Government, the Minister and the previous Administration about enhancing the role of public representatives and giving them additional powers. The Department has been pushing this policy for the past six or seven years. I am a councillor in this city and I was extremely annoyed when the council's powers relating to taxis were removed. Other powers will be removed by the Waste Management Bill, but at least this is being done through the avenue of legislation. The taxi issue was dealt with by order of the Minister. There has been a great deal of talk, but to date people's actions have failed to back this up.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the policy to which I refer is being pushed by the Department. The explanatory memorandum states that the aims of the Bill are to enhance the role of the elected member and support community involvement. That latter is probably the real purpose of the Bill, because it is the direction in which local government appears to be going. I am extremely concerned about that. I agree with Deputy Dukes that the role of public representatives is being reduced and they are being sidelined. Many of the changes to the SPCs have not been fully implemented and there have been industrial relations problems. However, in the past six or seven years there appears to have been a policy to remove all power from councillors. Anything the Department can get its hands on is being transferred to those involved in community involvement, namely, various quangos &ndash; be they established under the community pillars, the area partnerships or, more recently, the RAPID programme &ndash; which are answerable to no one.</P>

      <P>The city and county development boards have been strongly pushed by the Department, but they are a disaster. These boards use a dual form of reporting to the city or county manager and to the Department. That is a crazy model and I do not know who was responsible for developing it. It is similar to placing a cuckoo in another bird's nest, because all that is <Col N="173" /> happening is that internal tension is being created. The Minister often states that county development boards come under the aegis of local authorities. However, all they do is fight and squabble which is an extremely negative development.</P>
      <P>Some of the boards to which I refer display a strong anti-public representative bias. As far as I can see, they consult the agendas of elected public representatives and try to arrange to hold committee meetings, seminars, functions, etc., on days when those representatives are otherwise engaged. On budget day, the diary of every Member was full of functions being run by these quangos because they knew public representatives of all shapes and sizes would be tied down. They chose that day to hold events and exclude public representatives.</P>
      <P>Some of these groups believe they are the Cabinet in waiting. Before every city council meeting, one is usually given a cup of tea and a sandwich. However, I have heard rumours that city and county development boards hold their meetings or barnstorming sessions at some grand hotel or castle. I do not know when the Department of the Environment and Local Government will wake up to this fact, but I do not believe it will be before some of these partnership groups storm the gates of the Custom House and instigate a coup.</P>
      <P>The jargon used in the Bill, such as &ldquo;empowering&rdquo; the community, is fine and it sounds great. However, there are people, be they in this House or outside, who put their necks on the line and, while they may fight and squabble among themselves, they were elected to the offices they hold. It is all very well to put in place structures and encourage involvement from community representatives. However, public representatives have been sidelined and all power and resources is being transferred to the groups to which I refer. This has gone too far. The Department's policy, which it has pushed strongly, is wrong. Officials of the Department and Ministers will state that it has been a great success but it has been a flop. However, they continue to issue propaganda in favour of it in the hope that someone will believe them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of a city council for 16 years, I am strongly opposed to the notion of abolishing the dual mandate. If all the rumours are true about a recent development in this regard, I very much welcome it. It is vital for larger parties with a number of candidates running for office to be involved in local government. If the referendum on the Nice treaty last week showed anything, it is that the people want their public representatives to be involved locally and not always to be in Dáil Éireann debating international issues. We often wonder why only 65% of people vote in a general election, but it would be much lower if we had this pure system where we were not as close to the people. At the same time, power is being given to people who do not stand for election. I hope there is a change in the Bill regarding <Col N="174" /> the dual mandate. It is more difficult for public representatives for Galway, Kerry or Donegal to attend corporation or county council meetings than for those in Dublin where they manage to combine the two.</P>
    <P>It was proposed that councillors be paid, but that is unnecessary. The expenses system should be left as it is and any amendment to it should give people the option to drop out or stay in as they require. At least two councillors on Dublin City Council do not want a salary because they are on invalidity pensions and want to remain on the expenses system. The idea is that TDs must vacate their council seats because councillors will be paid, but I do not want any payment. I am happy with the system of expenses and many councillors and TDs do not want payment.</P>
    <P>The concept of a directly elected lord mayor or chairman sounds fine in theory, but there is no point in changing it unless real powers are given to the position. The present set-up is that every councillor has a turn in the position which is mainly ceremonial. The notion of a strong, political figure driving the needs of the city or county is good, sound logic and is how many cities and counties progress, but there is no point in having him or her directly elected unless powers are brought to the position. Those powers are not provided for in the Bill. If they were to be provided, it would require a change in the legislation governing city and county managers, something which might take 20 years if the small changes made under the strategic policy committees in recent years are anything to go by. I do not see the point of having directly elected lord mayors or chairmen unless they are given real powers.</P>
    <P>That raises another point about these changes. I thought the Minister had it in mind a few years ago to change the electoral system. The Bill is putting the cart before the horse in that the electoral system needs to be changed to single seat constituencies and some form a list system before we can begin to discuss abolishing the dual mandate.

      <P>I hope all the rumours about the Bill are true and that there will be a change. I generally support local government but we need to be fair. I agree with the previous speaker that we need to give power to public representatives. If they are given the resources and support, be they Members of the Oireachtas or members of local authorities, progress will be made.</P>

      <P>The Bill is a Pandora's box which, now that it is open, has allowed a number of issues out into the open which many of us want to tease out, tackle and understand more to bring forward legislation which deals with them in a much better way.</P>
      <P>I stated publicly my position on the status of Kilkenny city. I publicly declared my interest in ensuring the city status for Kilkenny was maintained. The Minister and the Taoiseach not only gave a commitment to me but echoed it on their visit to Kilkenny city for the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting that specific amendments would be tabled on Committee Stage to protect the charter of Kilkenny, given to us in 1609 and later in 1687 and 1862, which declared Kilkenny a city.</P>
      <P>We are very proud of the rich heritage and culture which exists there and I consider the trappings of local government, be it the robes or name of Alderman, to be part of our history and heritage. We are proud that we have been a corporation for so long and a city since 1609. We are anxious to retain that structure and I ask that the appropriate amendments be made available as soon as possible so that we can relax in the knowledge that the city status is protected in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I also make perfectly clear my position on the dual mandate. I know it was represented throughout the country, perhaps by people who did not have my interests at heart. It reminded me of Chinese whispers. My position, by the time it reached the final whisper, had been drastically distorted. I support the dual mandate. Local government lost a certain amount of its strength when many of the long-serving public representatives were bought out. That weakness still exists and newer members are only now coming to grips with what was and is involved in local government and what we expect to be involved in it in future. A huge learning process is in train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To remove Members of the Oireachtas from the local government system would weaken it further and would break a unique connection established through generations of politicians between local government and Members of the Oireachtas. It would also kill off the platform of information on many issues confronting the country which we end up airing in this Chamber. As bad as local government might be and as much as <Col N="176" /> it needs reform, this House needs a great deal of reform to make it much more meaningful to the lives of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>I have been a local councillor for 22 years and my father spent 50 years before me on the local authority. My family service to the local authority dates back to the early 1900s. I appreciate the role local authority members play in the make-up of democracy in Ireland. It is high time we acknowledged the voluntary role they play by giving them a direct payment. Whatever form it takes, be it payment or expenses, does not concern me. What does is that councillors would at least be compensated for the work they do.</P>
    <P>As regards the dual mandate and expenses, as a Member of the Oireachtas, I do not expect to be paid. I want to play a role in local government. I have raised the point directly with the Minister that I have a constitutional right to fight local elections if I choose to do so. I do not notice any cry from the public to change my mandate as a local government member and as a Member of the Oireachtas. They had the opportunity in 1999 but they did not take the seat from me. They endorsed my position. As a result, I support the role played by Oireachtas Members in local government. The only time I will change my mind about that is when the Oireachtas is overhauled and we are given a more meaningful role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Naughten. I appreciate the Chair giving me the opportunity to raise this issue and welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
      <P>For young drivers, particularly provisional drivers, the cost of maintaining a car has become prohibitive. The primary reason for this is the excessive insurance premiums with which young drivers are burdened. Provisional drivers are also faced with restrictions in having to be accompanied while driving and being prohibited from using motorways.</P>
      <P>This morning Macra na Feirme launched a set of proposals to deal with this problem. I was privileged to attend the launch and congratulate Macra na Feirme on its initiative. The proposals are aimed at ensuring provisional drivers receive more training before using the roads and that they take more responsibility while doing so. In return, Macra proposes the removal of the requirement of accompanying drivers and the ban on provisional drivers using motorways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the current insurance situation for young drivers is unsustainable. Premiums are unaffordable for most young drivers and rates <Col N="177" /> continue to increase. In a survey carried out in preparation of the Macra na Feirme proposal almost all the main insurance companies refused to quote young male drivers. The lowest quote available for a 21 year old male driver on a provisional licence was in excess of £3,200. This was £200 higher than one month earlier. The situation for female drivers was better, but the rates were still very high.</P>
    <P>Provisional drivers have been castigated in recent times. Their existence has been put forward as a major contributor to the current high accident and subsequent claim rate. While it is not a good policy to have a large number of unqualified drivers on our roads, it has to be remembered that the reason for the large increase in the number of provisional drivers is the excessive waiting list for driving tests. At one point waiting lists of one year were common. There are still long delays in some counties and the average waiting time is 14 weeks. Provisional drivers have been seriously disadvantaged because of this. They have put up with punitive insurance premiums and other restrictions such as not being allowed to drive on motorways and having to be accompanied by qualified drivers. Provisional drivers, and young drivers in general, are paying exorbitant rates for car insurance. Under the law, if a person wants to drive, he or she must be insured. It is not acceptable that the Government can then stand back and allow the free market to be the sole determinant of what the customer pays for the product. This is particularly unacceptable when there is such high price discrimination. The situation for provisional and all drivers is now intolerable. In a survey carried out by Macra na Feirme none of the five major companies would quote a price to any inexperienced driver under 25 years.</P>
    <P>The new penalty points system should be more severe on provisional drivers. There should be a much lower threshold for provisional drivers, particularly in relation to speeding offences. Any provisional driver caught speeding twice should be banned. For many drivers speeding is simply a bad habit. It is important that drivers are conscious of speeding from the day they start driving. A proper focus on speed detection rather than looking for L plates on motorways and monitoring the farcical rules of being accompanied would be a more effective way of ensuring provisional drivers are not a risk on our roads.</P>
    <P>The current insurance rates are excessive and the Government should impose controls on the amounts insurance companies can quote for third party cover.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work done by Deputy Naughten in this area. He has produced an excellent set of proposals and I ask the Minister to examine them carefully. He proposes the introduction of a novice driver's log book and the establishment of a statutory register of driving instructors and has considered compulsory lessons. Above all, he calls for a reduction in the waiting times for tests and the appointment of <Col N="178" /> additional driving testers who would be recruited on a permanent and contractual basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter and thank Deputy Neville for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P>The proposals put forward today by Macra na Feirme are very realistic. They complement the proposals we published last August. In the last five weeks since the introduction of the theory test insurance for young drivers has gone up £200. The theory test was supposed to improve the experience of provisional drivers and there should have been a recognition by the insurance industry of this fact. Instead, the insurance industry has increased the cost of insurance. The Government has again ignored the issue of insurance for young drivers and not tied the theory test into it.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister of State give the House an update on the Motor Insurance Advisory Board? When will we see a result from it? Will the Government consider putting a cap on insurance premiums for young drivers? A realistic proposal has been put forward by Macra na Feirme. It should be given serious consideration.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville has highlighted a very important issue. I ask the Minister of State to wake up and do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the early 1990s successive Governments have grappled with the issue of insurance costs, in particular, insurance costs for young drivers. There has been extensive research into ways of reducing insurance premiums. This research has indicated that costs of settling claims, particularly personal injury claims, are largely responsible for high insurance costs.</P>
      <P>When I became Minister of State with responsibility for commerce I provided that research that had begun into personal injuries compensation should continue. This research has resulted in the second report of the special working group on a personal injuries tribunal.</P>
      <P>The Government, having considered the report, has adopted its major recommendation to establish a personal injuries assessment board and an interdepartmental implementation group is now considering the logistics of this. The purpose of the new board is to reduce the costs of delivering compensation to claimants, not to reduce the amount of compensation paid. Costs of delivery, that is, fees to solicitors and barristers, fees to expert witnesses and insurance administration costs can account for up to 40% of the total cost of settling a claim. The proportion can be much higher for awards of £10,000 or less. There is anecdotal evidence that for an award of just £10,000, a further £15,000 may be incurred as delivery costs. Accordingly, the Government expects that the PIAB will result in lower total claims costs, leading to lower premium costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> While there is no denying the significance of the high cost of settling claims as a factor in the overall cost of insurance to the consumer, I took the view that there was a need to inquire into the bases on which premiums were charged to people of both sexes and different age groups. Accordingly, I established the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in 1998 to examine the factors that influence the cost of motor insurance, in particular the relationship between the premiums charged to different categories of drivers and the claims experience of those categories.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board is chaired by Ms Dorothea Dowling, claims manager of CIE and a Fellow of the Chartered Insurance Institute. The board members are representative of the various groups interested in motor insurance.</P>
    <P>The MIAB submitted an interim report to the Department last June. Deputies will recall that this document was released under the Freedom of Information Act last March. The board was very conscious that the data on which it had based its interim report were incomplete and that the findings were, therefore, tentative. Thus, the interim report clearly stated that the board required total acess to the individual raw data from each insurance company before any firm conclusions could be reached.</P>
    <P>Most of that data has now been delivered to the board and the remainder will be forthcoming within a timetable acceptable to the board. It is vital that any consideration by the Government of issues arising from the levels of motor insurance premiums should be on an accurate and well-informed basis. The Government has a statutory duty to require insurance companies to comply with solvency legislation. Consumers have a right to expect that the insurance companies with which they deal will be in a position to pay claims and generally meet their obligations to their policyholders. The House does not need reminding that motor insurance companies have failed in the past. The only sensible course is the one taken by me, which is to allow the board to continue its work in order that it may carry out a full and detailed analysis on reliable and robust data. Thus, the Government may consider the recommendations of the board, confident that they are derived from a rigourous analysis of facts.</P>
    <P>I understand Macra na Feirme has today launched a very thought provoking paper on insurance for young drivers. While the Department has just received these proposals, it might be worth commenting on some of them. One of the proposals involves compulsory driving lessons for provisional licence holders. This is a matter for my Government colleague, the Minister for Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. However, it is worth bearing in mind that compulsory lessons will add to the costs that young drivers have to bear.</P>

Further, the Government expects that the personal injuries assessment board, when operational, will contribute significantly to reducing insurance costs. Apart from these two major initiatives, the Government is continuing to keep this matter under active review, conscious of the need to alleviate the difficulties experienced by motorists in general and young motorists in particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great disappointment that I have to raise again the issue of the extension that is urgently needed for St. Colmcille's National School, The Quay, Westport. In recent months I have raised this matter many times with the Minister, having first raised it in February this year. The response from the Minister to date has been disappointing. The situation at the school is serious. The school was built in 1992 to cater for 150 pupils but the current enrolment is 182. This number is expected to increase to almost 200 in September. At present the school has six classrooms but some of the facilities, including the assembly hall and the principal's office, are being used for children with special needs. Several activities can no longer be carried out in the school because of the overcrowding. This case is a most urgent one. I have been contacted by the school's board of management, teachers and parents about this matter. As I pointed out a few months ago, the school is in the middle of a town, yet it has a large rural catchment area which has grown considerably in recent years. The management, teachers and parents are disappointed with the slow reaction of the Department. Instead of taking this extension stage by stage, the Minister should take a number of stages together. The necessary money should be approved immediately so that the school extension can be built. In that way it would be ready for September or, if not, then sometime later this year. What is happening at the moment amounts to stalling tactics by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am led to believe there is a go-slow in the Department because no funding is in place for school extensions. There is a problem within the Department and the funding is not there. I would like the Minister to respond to that point. What is the up-to-date position with that school? Will it be grant aided? When can we expect work to start on the school extension? Those are the questions that parents are asking me. I will meet the board of management and parents in the next few weeks so I want to have the exact answers for them. I have tabled Parliamentary Questions but, <Col N="181" /> while I mean no disrespect to your office, a Cheann Comhairle, the kind of replies I have received would not be acceptable to any public representative. It is embarrassing to have to convey them to the school's board of management, teachers and parents. I hope I will get good news from the Minister tonight. I want to receive an update on what is happening. I hope that funding will be put in place and that we will see action tomorrow so that neither parents nor their children will be worried about the position in future.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of outlining to this House the current position regarding the provision of improved accommodation at the school referred to by the Deputy. At present, St. Colmcille's National School has a staffing level of one principal, six mainstream class teachers and a shared remedial and resource teacher. The latter is not based in the school. The enrolment at 30 September last was 182 pupils. The school's present facilities consist of six classrooms with sanitary facilities and ancillary accommodation.</P>
      <P>The Department has received an application from the management authorities of this school for grant assistance towards the provision of an additional classroom and additional ancillary accommodation. This application is one of several hundred applications being processed by the Department's building unit. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that in view of the significant increase in the number of applications received, it is not possible to provide a time frame as to when this project will proceed to architectural planning.</P>
      <P>I assure both the House and the Deputy that the case will be kept under review. I thank him again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position to this House.</P>

      <P>The final date for the submission of applications for this year's suckler cow premium scheme is 30 June. Livestock marts will reopen on 18 June, just 12 days prior to the final date for the submission of applications for this scheme. The Minister knows as well as I do that by this time each year there would normally have been a substantial trade in in-calf heifers from dairy farms to suckler farms. That trade has been completely disrupted since 26 February last, the date on which strict movement controls were applied following the precautions taken against foot and mouth disease. A 12-day period between 18 and 30 June is simply not enough time for that pent-up trade to take place. It will take time to organise the necessary sales of in-calf heifers so that the normal business of both suckler and dairy herds can be resumed. It will take time for the marts to organise the necessary sales as well as for all the people in the market, both buyers and <Col N="182" /> sellers, to get themselves organised so that the trade can take place. The final date for applications for this year's suckler cow premium scheme should be extended to 15 July so that the trade and the applications can be carried out in a normal and orderly fashion. I hope the Minister will agree with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>EU regulations provide that applications under the suckler cow premium scheme may be submitted within an overall period of six months during a calendar year. In 2000, the application period ran for only two months, from 3 April to 31 May 2000. Following representations from the farming organisations the application period in respect of the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme opened on 2 January 2001 and applications will continue to be accepted by my Department up to 29 June 2001, as provided under EU regulations. Furthermore, applications may also be submitted for 25 days after the closing date &ndash; that is, up to 24 July 2001 &ndash; but will be subject to a 1% penalty for each late working day.</P>
      <P>Producers are allowed to apply for the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme on heifers over eight months of age. The number of heifers allowed is limited to 20% of the overall number of animals declared. Since 14 May 2001, farm to farm sales are allowed under permit. This development has provided producers with the opportunity of purchasing animals to fill their quota.</P>
      <P>On 29 May 2001, I announced a concession for applicants who lost or disposed of animals which were declared for the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme and which could not be replaced within 20 calendar days, as required under EU regulations, while movement restrictions were in place due to foot and mouth disease. Under new arrangements agreed with the European Commission, applicants who lost or disposed of animals in the period from 11 February to 13 May 2001 now have until 12 July 2001 to replace any such animal with another eligible animal.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, following receipt of the latest recommendations of the expert group, I was able to announce that as and from 18 June marts may reopen. This will further facilitate producers who wish to purchase animals in advance of applying for the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme.</P>
      <P>Since the application period for the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme will remain open until 29 June, I do not consider that it will be necessary to extend the application period. However, I will closely monitor the matter over the coming days. In any event, an extension to the current six months application period would require the approval of the European Commission, which is not the easiest thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment and I am also glad the Minister of State is here to respond. I will highlight the discrimination that is being inflicted on a member of the Garda Síochána who has been confined to indoor duties because he has to wear a beard. I know the person in question very well. I understand that he has suffered from a facial skin disorder since his teenage years when he first started growing a beard. It is commonly accepted that the only effective relief for this condition is to cease shaving. The member in question joined the Garda Síochána in September 1982. Obviously his membership of that force required that he shave daily which was a cause of serious discomfort to him.</P>
      <P>While attending the training college in Templemore, the superintendent in charge noticed the discomfort of the garda trainee on a constant basis. Six years later the garda sought medical assistance due to the serious discomfort. An appointment was made with the then Garda surgeon and the member attended the Garda depot hospital in August 1988. The Garda surgeon, although not a dermatologist, granted permission to the member to grow and wear a beard but that direction was not followed through administratively and subsequently the garda was not allowed to wear a beard while in uniform.</P>
      <P>In February 1999 the garda sought the assistance of his own GP in Dublin and he was referred to an eminent dermatologist, who examined him and diagnosed that he was suffering from a medical condition known as folliculitis barbae. The dermatologist explained that the only treatment is to allow the sufferer to grow a beard. He sent a copy of his findings to the then Garda surgeon who concurred with his findings. Unfortunately, the Garda surgeon subsequently died and somebody else took up his duties.</P>
      <P>The member in question, who must shave on a daily basis, still suffers serious facial discomfort. Nothing has changed to improve his position and Garda management at local level, while sympathetic to his needs, state they are governed by the regulations contained in the Garda code, which prevent gardaí in uniform from wearing beards.</P>
      <P>A person is being discriminated against. A garda in uniform cannot wear a beard because of an outdated regulation. Uniformed members of other police forces throughout Europe who have skin disorders can wear beards. A garda in such a position should not be deprived of the opportunity to participate in all facets of the force's work. A member of the Garda should not be treated as a second class citizen because of a skin disorder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is beyond the time that the needs of members of the Garda who suffer from diagnosed medical conditions should be given fair consideration. I appeal through the Minister of State to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="184" /> Reform to instruct the Garda authorities to exercise common sense and stop hiding behind the code of regulations which are discriminatory to an individual who has been diagnosed with a skin complaint. It is absolutely wrong that a citizen of this State should be denied a basic civil right through an outdated and totally ridiculous regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to promote Government policy on policing; to provide the regulatory and structural framework within which the Garda Síochána operates; to provide the necessary resources for the Garda to carry out its role; and to promote measures which will contribute to greater efficiency, effectiveness and accountability. The Minister's record in this regard is open to public scrutiny and the facts speak for themselves. The Garda force has never been as well resourced as it is today. The Garda budget has increased from some £457 million in 1997 to more than £690 million and Garda strength has now reached 11,640 &ndash; an all-time high compared to 10,800 in 1997. Furthermore, it is on target to reach 12,000 by the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>While the Minister has responsibility for policing policy and is accountable to the Dáil for the Garda, it is appropriate for him to get involved in the day-to-day management of the force. Section 8 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, vests in the Commissioner the general direction and control of the Garda, subject to regulations.</P>
      <P>Turning to the specific subject matter of the debate it is not the Minister's role nor does he intend to comment on the merits of an individual's case within the Garda. He has been advised that the regulations contained in the Garda code require male members to be clean shaven when on duty, except for moustaches. Divisional officers may allow a member working in plain clothes to wear a beard. The policy of the Garda is to take a sympathetic approach to members suffering from any medical condition. In that regard I understand that the Garda authorities have made genuine efforts to accommodate the individual concerned.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has raised the question of discrimination. Three years ago there was no comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in this jurisdiction. Since then the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, have been enacted, which, together with the equality infrastructure &ndash; the Equality Authority and the Office of the Director for Equality Investigations which have been put in place to give effect to the legislation &ndash; are regarded by some commentators as the most comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in the European Union.</P>
      <P>If there is any improper discrimination, the mechanisms are in place to address it.</P>
      <P>
      </P>

      <P>The level of staffing resources of the Competition Authority is kept under continuous review by my Department in close consultation with the authority. In the period since the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, the total authorised staff level of the authority has increased from about 17 to the present level of 29. Arising from a review carried out by Deloitte &amp; Touche, I propose to increase this number by 15 to 44, a level which I am satisfied will be sufficient for the authority's statutory responsibilities going forward.</P>
      <P>The authority has in the past experienced difficulties in retaining staff but the situation has improved considerably over the past year mainly as a result of improvements in staff terms and conditions. As regards the impact of staffing difficulties on searches, I understand from the authority that while some problems were experienced in late 1999 and in 2000, these problems have now been resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under current arrangements, members of An Garda Síochána do not participate in the operations of the authority. However, it is proposed <Col N="186" /> to include three garda posts in the additional 15 new posts referred to above.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Department has specific responsibility for providing information to assist all businesses, including SMEs, with their preparations for the changeover to the euro. The EMU business <Col N="187" /> awareness campaign, which is managed by Forfás on behalf of our Department, has undertaken this task since it was launched in December 1996. To date, the campaign has produced a comprehensive range of publications which have been widely disseminated to Irish business.</P>
    <P>A detailed booklet dealing with the specific needs of SMEs was published recently covering key areas of preparation, including accounting, software, payroll, Revenue and other issues and 110,000 copies have been issued to SME representative bodies and individual SMEs. A training pack is being produced specifically for retailers for the purpose of staff training; this will be widely distributed to retailers commencing in July.</P>
    <P>As regards the general lack of preparation, a survey conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, in December last shows that 72% of Irish firms have received information on the changeover and have expressed high levels of satisfaction with the information received. However, it is clear from the same research that a considerable number of firms have yet to act on the information provided, particularly in the case of SME firms.</P>
    <P>During the second half of this year Forfás will intensify its activities in preparing SMEs for the changeover. These intensified activities will include a major media advertising campaign and continued monitoring of progress through surveys and presentations to business groups. Since the start of this year the Forfás EMU business awareness campaign has included the following specific activities: new guidelines to assist retailers in planning for the changeover, of which 200,000 copies have been distributed through a wide variety of channels including direct distribution by post to retailers; presentations on the relevant EMU planning issues for business at meetings, conferences and-or seminars of professional, trade and business organisations, particularly those that represent companies in the SME sector; exhibition stands at appropriate conferences, trade and business exhibitions that facilitate dissemination of campaign messages, particularly to companies in the SME sector; articles/features in relevant publications, newsletters and journals of trade, business and professional organisations, particularly those focused on companies in the SME sector.</P>
    <P>In addition, the campaign will continue with its joint information initiative with <i>Running Your Business</i>, the magazine of the Small Firms Association which is circulated to a dedicated list of 30,000 small firms. There is a LoCall helpline to assist businesses with their queries regarding changeover issues. A national conference on the euro, which was held in Loughrea, County Galway, highlighted the changeover experiences of the SME firms involved in the Loughrea euro town project as they switched to euro based trading. The Loughrea project, which has been run under the auspices of the Forfás EMU business <Col N="188" /> awareness campaign, has identified many practical issues for SMEs in preparing for the euro throughout Ireland and beyond.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, however, it is the responsibility of each firm to ensure that they are able to conduct their business in euro from 1 January 2002. The EMU business awareness campaign can only assist by providing the necessary information that will assist them to do this. I am satisfied that the necessary information has been, and continues to be, provided to Irish businesses to facilitate them with this task.</P>

      <P>The new Equal community initiative which I formally launched on 6 June 2001 is the successor to the previous employment and adapt human resource community initiatives. Equal, with support from the European social fund, ESF, will fund and support, on a transnational co-operation basis, innovative activities aimed at combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market. These activities will be based on the four pillars of the European employment strategy and within the following themes: employability &ndash; access and return to the labour market; entrepreneurship &ndash; business creation process to be open to all; adaptability &ndash; inclusive workplace practices and lifelong learning, coping with information communication technologies and upgrading skills; and equal opportunities &ndash; work-life balance and new forms of work organisation.</P>
      <P>A partnership approach, the Development Partnership, involving all the actors will be the framework for project activity under Equal. Only Equal development partnerships will be eligible to receive funding under this new initiative. In pursuance of the North-South provisions of the Belfast Agreement, the operational programme contains arrangements for co-operation on common policy areas at development partnership level and at operational level between Equal managing authorities in Northern Ireland and the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development partnership's activities will be funded through the ESF at an intervention rate of up to 75%. ESF funding available totals 33.9 million &ndash; £26.7 million &ndash; and together with public and private match funding, the total fund will amount to 47 million &ndash; £37 million &ndash; over the period of the round 2001-06. My Department will act as the managing authority for Equal. The Department will be assisted in this task by the Work Research Cooperative, social and economic consultants, who have been <Col N="189" /> appointed as the technical support structure for the initiative in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Selection of development partnerships for funding will follow a public call for proposals targeted for the end of June 2001. It is expected that applicants will be given eight to ten weeks to complete their applications for entry into the developmental stage of the programme, Action 1, which begins on 15 November 2001. It is proposed to fund up to 15 development partnerships in a first round call under Equal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 94, 101 and 110 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are currently in the region of 33,500 participants on the community employment programme, of whom 10,520 are over 50 years of age. Participants can remain on the programme for a period of one to three years depending on their age and unemployment status. The maximum <Col N="191" /> duration on CE for all participants is three years, with the exception of offshore island inhabitants and participants on drugs task force projects.</P>
    <P>Participants on CE are usually within the age range of 25 to 65. A person who is on CE when they reach the age of 65 may finish out their term and is not automatically terminated from the programme. The primary purpose of CE is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into employment in the open labour market. The person who is on any FÁS programme on reaching the age of 65 will have been eligible due to the eligibility criteria at the time of applying and will remain on such a programme until the approved eligibility period elapses, even if such date brings them past 65.</P>
    <P>The rules of eligibility for FÁS programmes are focused on those who are in receipt of benefits due to unemployment &ndash; live register status &ndash; and other social-physical disadvantage. These benefits would normally be aimed at people aged under 65. My Department is finalising proposals for a high supports process, as required under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which will enhance the range of options available for job seekers with employment barriers, including older persons on community employment who have limited employment opportunities in the open labour market. Further consultations with the social partners on the high supports process are due to take place shortly and I hope this process can be put in place at an early date.</P>
    <P>Opportunities to obtain permanent employment for CE participants who have completed their term on the programme are influenced by location, education and the skill level of the participants. The last ESRI survey conducted for FÁS, covered participants who had left the programme from January to March, 1999 and was carried out in the period April to July 2000. This survey indicated that 59% of former participants had secured employment. There are now more job opportunities available than ever before.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in either the Nice Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union or under national legislation, which in any way restricts the above mentioned policy on eligibility for FÁS programmes.</P>

      <P>My Department is the designated managing authority for two of the operational programmes under the national development plan. These are the productive sector operational programme and the employment <Col N="192" /> and human resources development operational programme.</P>
      <P>The structure of the productive sector is that there are four priorities covered &ndash; research; technological development and innovation; industry &ndash; indigenous and foreign direct investment; marketing and sea fisheries development. The total OP allocation over the plan is 7.3 billion. These priorities are further broken down into 21 measures which are further broken down into 41 sub-measures. These sub-measures are administered by the relevant bodies with responsibility for the particular areas and contain numerous projects which will receive funding under the national development plan. At this time it is not possible to ascertain the exact number of projects. Some of the measures are competitive and the projects themselves are evaluated only at time of application.</P>
      <P>The human resources development OP is almost exclusively a multi-annual rather than project based programme; that is, the essential mode of delivery is the provision of publicly funded education or training programmes over the period to 2006. The total allocation over the plan is 14.2 billion. Again, significant expenditure is planned on construction work, particularly by the Department of Education and Science, to provide the facilities needed for educational courses on over 2,500 projects of all sizes. In the social economy area, however, a project based approach is being used. It is projected that there will be over 400 projects over the OP lifetime.</P>
      <P>The objectives and strategies outlined in the national development plan, which relate to my Department, were drawn up in close consultation with Government Departments and the implementing agencies, which include Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and FÁS. Under the plan, the Departments and agencies have been set ambitious targets, in particular in relation to the development of the Objective One BMW region. For example, under the productive sector operational programme, IDA Ireland has a target to locate 50% of all new green field jobs in that region.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committees of the operational programmes have responsibility for the implementation of the programmes in respective sectors. These committees include Government Departments, the EU Commission, implementing agencies, regional assemblies, regional authorities, employers/business representatives, trade unions, farming representatives and the community and voluntary pillar. Targets have been put in place to measure the progress of the operational programmes at mid-term in 2003 and on completion in 2006. I am confident that over the period of the plan the targets for both programmes are realistic and achievable.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>In the year 2000 there were 524 IDA Ireland supported US companies operating in Ireland employing a total of 94,100 people. The slowdown in the US economy is having a negative but limited impact on the overseas owned manufacturing sector in Ireland. The most vulnerable jobs in Ireland are those in relatively low skill areas, where Ireland is becoming an uncompetitive location for manufacturing. In this respect, a primary element of current IDA Ireland policy is to assist client companies to move up the value chain into higher tech jobs, requiring higher skilled and better paid employees which will help to secure employment levels into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, IDA Ireland job losses directly associated with this downturn that have either already happened or have been announced total about 1,400, virtually all of which are in US companies. In addition, some of the major multinationals have temporarily halted recruitment or slowed the build up of planned expansions. Overall IDA Ireland still hopes to create about 12,000 new jobs in 2001, which is not as strong as in 2000 but still high by historical standards. However, further <Col N="194" /> softening of the US and European economies could affect this outcome.</P>
    <P>Given the scale of the downturn in the US economy over recent months, particularly in the manufacturing sector, the impact to date on the Irish economy in terms of GNP growth and employment-unemployment has been quite small. This is due to the following reasons: the downturn, while sharp, has not been in progress very long; the impact has been confined to the information technology related sectors to date and our base of companies in this sector is relatively young and focused on higher value products, often incorporating functions such as customer/technical support, software development and logistics, which make them less vulnerable than basic manufacturing plants; other sectors such as pharmaceuticals/healthcare and most international services and financial services sectors are to date largely unaffected; economic conditions within the EU are, in contrast to the US, still strong. Since, this is the main market for the output of US owned companies in Ireland, Irish operations are somewhat less likely to be affected by any slowdown than those in the US; the current buoyant labour market conditions in the economy as a whole mean that those losing jobs are unlikely to experience significant difficulty finding new positions.</P>
    <P>However, it must be emphasised that a stronger and longer lived slowdown in the US economy than most commentators are predicting at this time would potentially have serious consequences for growth and employment in Ireland. This makes it more important than ever that those issues over which we actually have some control and which impact heavily on the competitiveness of Ireland as a base for foreign direct investment continue to be given priority. Among the key factors to maintain competitive advantage in the future will be a greater focus on education, skills and research and the roll out of infrastructure particularly into the regions.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that arising from positive Government actions the economy is now in a much more robust condition to weather the vagaries of the global economic cycle and that foreign direct investment will continue to play a key role in our economic success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of rising insurance costs has been a matter of concern to Government for a number of years. The cost of insurance is related to the cost of claims. Our Department currently has three initiatives in place to address this issue.</P>
      <P>Following studies which showed that the cost of delivering personal injury compensation through the courts can be as high as 40% of total costs, the Government recently decided to approve the establishment of a personal injuries assessment board, PIAB. An interdepartmental implementation group has been set up to progress the establishment of the board, with the PIAB becoming operational in 2002. It is expected that all personal injury claims arising from employer's liability and motor insurance would have to be referred to the PIAB.</P>
      <P>The motor insurance advisory board, MIAB, has been charged with advising us on motor insurance costs and, in particular, with examining the relationship between the incidence of claims and the premiums charged for various classes of policyholder identified by age and sex. This is the issue of most interest to the policyholders. The final report of the MIAB is expected at the end of this year and any further action will be decided upon at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the workplace safety initiative is aimed at reducing the cost of insurance and is supported and promoted by the ICTU, IBEC, the Health and Safety Authority, our own Department and also the Irish Insurance Federation. Under this initiative a voluntary code on safe working and <Col N="196" /> accident prevention has been developed. Many companies have already adopted the voluntary code proposed under this initiative. The objectives are to reduce workplace accidents, to encourage injured workers to return at the earliest possible date to the workplace and to improve claims handling procedures, thus reducing insurance costs.</P>
    <P>While the Government does not wish to rule out any particular course of action, EU law prevents us from requiring the prior approval of scales of premium.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>The processing period for obtaining work permits for non-nationals is always dependant on the individual circumstances of each case. The processing period for work permits is currently taking up to seven weeks. The number of applications received by my Department is continuing to grow at an unprecedented rate. It increased from an average of 600 per week at end year 2000 to an average of 1,000 per week recently. Some 4,400 applications for processing, including cases not yet registered, were received in the month of May, the highest so far this year. The highest comparable monthly figure received last year was 2,300.</P>
      <P>The number of work permits issued for the first five months of this year was 14,200 compared to 4,175 for the same period in 2000. This reflects the considerable commitment being made by my Department, through increased staffing levels and overtime working, to meet the ever increasing demands of employers applying for work permits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently examining options for speedier processing of work permit applications with a view to providing an improved service to employers. I introduced a fast track system last year through the working visa-work authorisation scheme to facilitate the recruitment of suitably qualified people from outside the EEA for designated sectors of the employment market where skill shortages are particularly <Col N="197" /> acute, for example, in the IT and construction sectors and for registered nurses.</P>

      <P>Employment rights legislation in Ireland establishes the minimum statutory rights applicable to all 1.8 million people working in Ireland whether part-time or full-time, high or low skill, national or non-national. Employment rights legislation makes no distinction between the rights of foreign workers and any other workers. All workers in Ireland, without exception, are entitled to the same statutory employment rights and protections.</P>
      <P>Over the years legislation has been enacted in areas such as holidays, working hours, payment of wages, minimum notice, minimum wage and others. The labour inspectorate of my Department has responsibility for enforcing this employment legislation generally and the inspectors therein operate in a fair, objective and impartial way without any differentiation with respect to nationality. They investigate complaints about infringements of employment rights and, where breaches are identified, seek to have the employer redress matters. They may also refer the case to the Chief State Solicitor's office for prosecution.</P>
      <P>The complement of authorised officers now in the labour inspectorate is 17, having been increased last year on foot of an earlier Government decision. Recently, however, as a consequence of career breaks and promotions, three officers have left the service. Steps are in train at present to restore the service to its full complement.</P>
      <P>Apart from the staffing issue, the labour inspectorate has undergone a major review of its operations. That exercise is coming to a conclusion now and it is anticipated that the effectiveness and efficiency of the service will be improved significantly as the outcome of the review is implemented over the next few months.</P>

      <P>As with all EU directives, member states will be given a set period of time within which to transpose the directive into national law. The current proposed transposition period for this directive is three years. Following adoption of the directive, my Department will take the necessary steps to ensure that the transposition date is met.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the statement by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions referred to by the Deputy. The change to an elective right to information and consultation under the proposed directive was widely accepted by member states, as this was the approach taken in the European works council directive which provides for information and consultation in transnational companies with over 1,000 employees.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the potential of the candidate countries, following their accession to the European Union, to help meet the labour supply needs of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>The employment action plan sets out the strategic objectives of labour market policy in Ireland. A key objective of the plan is to &ldquo;mobilize labour supply, including through increased female participation, equal opportunities and a balanced increase in immigration, in order to contribute to a consistent, strong, sustainable and non-inflationary level of economic growth&rdquo;. Consistent with that approach Ireland currently operates polices which encourage inward movement of both European Economic Area, EEA, and non-EEA nationals to fill job vacancies.</P>
      <P>The European Union represents a common labour market of 160 million people. Under the treaties of the European Union, nationals of other member states have the right to take up employment in Ireland on an equal basis with Irish citizens. Over the longer term, provided economic and employment growth is maintained and subject to the extension of the more liberal movement of workers under the EU treaties to the accession countries, this should further facilitate the recruitment of workers from those regions into the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> In relation to non-EEA nationals, a work permits and work visa authorisation regime is in operation. Work permits are issued to employers to recruit named individuals to fill vacancies in the firm. A work visa scheme was introduced last year to facilitate the recruitment of suitably qualified people for designated sectors of the labour market where shortages were particularly acute.</P>

      <P>There are a number of such proposals in place including, as a result of a recent Government decision, the establishment of a personal injuries assessment board, PIAB. It is hoped that the work of the PIAB would, in the course of time, substantially reduce the number of personal injury claims being brought to court, thus reducing the legal and other costs involved in the delivery of personal injury compensation. The interdepartmental implementation group set up to progress the establishment of the PIAB has convened a number of meetings and it is expected that the board will be operational next year.</P>
      <P>The work of the motor insurance advisory board is aimed at providing me with information and advice on trends in motor insurance costs and with policy recommendations for addressing those costs. The issue of the high cost of insurance for young drivers is especially being examined by the board. The MIAB will undertake an analysis of more complete data being provided to it and its final report is expected by the end of the year. Upon receipt of this report and taking all other initiatives into consideration, I will then decide what further action is appropriate to reduce the cost of motor insurance.</P>

NTF moneys are being applied to schemes of training in and for employment operated by FÁS, Shannon Development, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Skillnets, as set out in the appendix to my Department's Vote in the Estimates. To date FÁS and Shannon Development have drawn down a total of £36.5 million. The balance of moneys in the fund is available for allocation to approved schemes under the fund.

The Act also provides that the Minister shall consult with representatives of employers and employees in regard to the functions specified under section 7.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Making accurate comparisons between motor insurance costs in Ireland and other European countries is difficult because of variations in the type of insurance cover, age groups, types of vehicles and even regional differences within countries. Most significantly, there are differences in how compensation for personal injuries is paid in these countries.</P>
      <P>Countries such as France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden provide compensation benefits almost exclusively through the medium of social security benefits with a high level of earnings related income support. Ireland, on the other hand, effectively operates two parallel systems of compensation provision, that is, a social security scheme of occupational injury benefits, paid on a flat rate basis with increases for qualified dependants, while allowing unrestricted access to tort liability claims for compensation for loss of earnings and pain and suffering. A similar system operates in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this and other complex reasons, claims paid through insurance are more costly in Ireland than in other EU member states. This Government has taken a number of initiatives, for example, in the areas of road safety and licensing and testing of drivers, to reduce the number of accidents and, therefore, claims costs. In our Department's area of responsibility, the main initiative arises from the second report of the special working group on a personal injury tribunal. The Government has decided to adopt the principal recommend<Col N="203" /> ation of the group and establish a personal injuries assessment board to reduce the costs of delivering compensation to injured parties. These costs can account for as much as 40% of the total cost of settling a claim. Indeed, at some levels, it can exceed the amount of compensation paid to the injured party. For instance, to pay £10,000 in compensation can cost up to an additional £15,000 in legal fees, fees to medical experts and insurance administration costs. It is expected that, once the board is operational, it will reduce the costs of settling claims and have a consequent favourable effect on insurance costs in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Figures published by the Central Statistics Office at the beginning of April show that there were 39 strikes and 97,046 man days lost in 2000 compared to 32 strikes and 215,587 man days lost in 1999. While the reduction in man days lost during 2000 is a positive development, I am concerned at the extent and nature of industrial action currently taking place.</P>
      <P>Some employers and unions are not using their own agreed industrial relations procedures and are resorting to taking unilateral action. Equally, there is a noticeable increase in the incidence of unofficial industrial action. There has been disruption to building work on a number of construction sites in the past year. Unofficial action is undemocratic and does not serve the interests of workers. It is to the benefit of all parties that third party machinery is used before action is taken by either side in pursuit of their aims. A fast track procedure for processing disputes has recently been put in place for the construction industry.</P>
      <P>More than four fifths of cases dealt with by the Labour Relations Commission are settled at conciliation. Issues that are not resolved through the use of the Labour Relations Commission's conciliation service are normally referred to the Labour Court for investigation. The majority of Labour Court recommendations are accepted by the parties. Internal dispute resolution machinery within individual companies has also been successful in resolving conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our voluntarist approach to industrial relations has been favoured by successive Governments and our social partnership model, in place since 1987, has been a critical factor in achieving our current economic wellbeing. The Labour Relations Commission has recently embarked on a round of consultations with the social partners <Col N="204" /> and interested parties on how it can improve its services. The National Centre for Partnership and Performance is also committed to improving enterprise level partnership arrangements.</P>
    <P>We need to build on partnership as set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I am satisfied that the existing industrial relations structures can do this and I will consult ICTU and IBEC on how we can best enhance partnership arrangements based on mutual gains principles in preference to old style adversarial approaches.</P>

      <P>The board of FÁS, which I appointed earlier this year for a five-year term, has recently commenced a strategic review of its role and operations. I have welcomed this initiative by the board, which, I believe is timely in light of the changed and very positive labour market conditions which now prevail.</P>
      <P>If we are to maintain our economic and employment performance over the longer term, continuous up-skilling of people, both in and seeking employment, must become the norm. In tackling these issues we are also presented with a social opportunity to address long-term unemployment and disadvantage.</P>
      <P>In the context of its strategic review I have indicated to the board that I consider FÁS to have a key role in achieving the Government's objectives of full employment and I have asked that a particular focus continue to be placed on the long-term unemployed with a view to helping them make the transition to work.</P>
      <P>In more specific terms I believe that the core activities of FÁS &ndash; matching jobseekers and skills with vacancies, training and integration of those who are disadvantaged and targeted training of the labour force &ndash; will need to tackle certain key challenges including the provision of an effective and efficient employment service; increasing female participation in the labour force; providing older workers with the option of staying longer in the workforce; encouraging migrant workers in a targeted way to meet labour and skills needs in the economy; eliminating remaining long-term unemployment; integrating into the workforce persons suffering from economic or social disadvantage; up-skilling the Irish labour force to become more adaptable in the face of change and encouraging a culture of lifelong learning in the workplace.</P>
      <P>While I have no specific plans to privatise FÁS activities, as has happened in other countries, I believe that FÁS needs to examine whether it should be the direct service provider for all of its activities or whether in any case there are means by which FÁS can meet its objectives in a more effective and flexible manner. I am also anxious to ensure that there is no duplication of activities with other public or private sector organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My overall objective is to establish clear poli<Col N="206" /> cies for implementation by FÁS based on the new labour market challenges as outlined above and to assess the agencies success by reference to the results in those areas. I look forward to receiving the outcome of the board's deliberations which I will take fully into account in setting policy for FÁS for the medium term.</P>

The reduction in absolute numbers participating, together with the changed eligibility criteria, are considered to be appropriate given the current economic climate and buoyancy in employment projections.</P>
      <P>Consultations with relevant Departments are currently taking place in order to progress the mainstreaming of essential services currently undertaken by participants on the CE programme. The mainstreaming of these services should enhance the services being provided and provide employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed. The mainstreaming of CE services will further reduce participation levels.</P>
      <P>Discussions with the Department of Education and Science with regard to schools services are at an advanced stage and I intend to begin the mainstreaming process and to transfer CE funding freed up by the reduction in CE positions in schools to that Department in time for the new school year in September next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is finalising proposals for a new high supports process, as required under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which will enhance the range of options available for job seekers with particular employment barriers. Further consultations with the social partners on the high supports process are due to take place <Col N="207" /> shortly and I hope this process can be put in place at an early date.</P>
    <P>My Department is also considering the position of older persons, workers in rural areas and others who have previously participated on CE, and who are having difficulty progressing to open employment. This issue will be also considered in the context of developing policy for the high supports process, and in the light of the implications of both elements for the future operation of CE following the mainstreaming of essential services.</P>
    <P>FÁS prioritises projects based on the services being provided and on the particular needs identified in the Community. In this regard, rural disadvantage is taken into account by FÁS when prioritising the renewal of projects, and approving the allocation of CE places. However, CE participants working on rural projects are required to meet the general eligibility criteria regarding age and employment status.</P>
    <P>In the context of labour shortages and the dramatic reductions in the numbers of long-term unemployed I believe we must continue to gradually reduce the overall numbers participating on active labour market programmes. This can be achieved through a process of mainstreaming jobs and targeting available resources at those most in need. There are now more job opportunities available than ever before. However, a reducing level of CE will remain an important intervention for the long-term unemployed and socially excluded for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>On foot of a general complaint, an authorised officer from my labour inspectorate visited this company a week prior to the recent media reports. The company was inspected for compliance with requirements set down under the Minimum Wage Act, 2000, the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, and the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 which covers holidays, rest periods and maximum working time. The examination of the records presented during that visit indicated that <Col N="209" /> there was no breaches of labour law in regard to the various Act mentioned. The records presented were well maintained, of a high standard and the company representatives were fully co-operative with the inspector.</P>
      <P>Arising from the subsequent reports, the inspector has been in contact with all the parties concerned and has arranged meetings with existing and previous employees. The issues, which have been highlighted already, and anything else of concern will be examined and the relevant employment regulations and appropriate redress mechanisms will be explained fully to the individuals concerned. Where it is indicated that there have been violations of employment rights by the company the inspector will record the pertinent details and follow up with the company.</P>
      <P>In the event that evidence of non-compliance with labour legislation is found, my inspectorate will seek redress for the individuals who have been mistreated and, if appropriate, a prosecution will be initiated.</P>

      <P>However, I am assured by IDA Ireland that industrial property is being provided in order to assist industrial development in west Waterford.

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, the national authority for occupational safety and health, known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body charged with overall responsibility for the administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day-to-day function of the authority.</P>
      <P>Statistical information concerning the number of fatalities and injuries in any work sector is collected by the Health and Safety Authority and is therefore obtainable directly from the authority.</P>
      <P>I have, however, been informed by the authority that there were 24 construction-related fatalities in 2000, while seven construction related fatal accidents have been reported to the authority this year to date. The number of accidents in the construction sector, resulting in more than three days absence from work, reported to date to the Health and Safety Authority, for 2000, is 1087.</P>
      <P>The management of health and safety in all sectors of employment is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, information and awareness-raising coupled with a partnership approach. There is a strong legislative base by which safety standards in the construction sector can be managed and this legislation is enforced in a pro-active manner by the Health and Safety Authority. The additional resources, both financial and staffing, which I have secured for the authority, are being put to good effect in the construction sector through targeted inspection, enforcement and awareness-raising activities.</P>
      <P>However, both I and the authority are of the firm belief that for greater health and safety improvements to be brought about in the construction sector, a strong partnership approach to the issue of safety is crucial. This partnership approach was further developed and strengthened in 2000 in the context of the Construction Safety Partnership, CSP, which includes representatives of the CIF, ICTU and SIPTU as well as the Health and Safety Authority and other relevant Departments-agencies.</P>
      <P>The report of the CSP sets out a detailed three year plan to improve occupational safety, health and welfare standards in the construction industry, and the parties to the plan have made a number of wide-ranging commitments which they have undertaken to implement over that period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations of the plan cover measures to improve safety consultation and <Col N="211" /> safety representation, safety training, introduction of safety management systems and increased inspection activity by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>The partnership has recently produced its first progress report outlining the main areas of progress over the past 12 months. These include the initiation of a safety representatives pilot project which resulted in the distribution of information to 30,000 construction workers and the provision of training for 118 safety representatives, the undertaking of a major training programme for safety officers and safety managers, increased inspection by the Health and Safety Authority, the establishment of a Joint ICTU-CIF Safety Council to collaborate on information, promotion and research activities, as well as the development of legislative amendments to the existing 1995 construction regulations to underpin the recommendations of the plan. These amendments are at present being examined by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of reports regarding the mistreatment of certain non-nationals placed in employment here on foot of work permit applications and my condemnation of these abuses is already on record. Such reports indicate that a small number of employers are engaged in these practices and that there are particular sectors, including the agricultural sector, where such practices seem to be a feature. In this connection I wish to put such employers on notice that I am quite determined that they will not be allowed to get away with exploitation of vulnerable people.</P>
      <P>Employment rights legislation in Ireland establishes the minimum statutory rights applicable to all 1.8 million people working in Ireland whether part-time or full-time, high or low skill, national or non-national. The legislation makes no distinction between the rights of foreign workers and any other workers. All workers in Ireland, without exception, are entitled to the same statutory employment rights and protections so the protections of Irish labour law apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as to native Irish workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Inspectorate of my Department has an ongoing responsibility for monitoring the employment conditions of various categories of vulnerable workers, including immigrant workers. In this regard the Inspectorate can pursue alle<Col N="212" /> gations of workers being subjected to excessive working hours, illegal deductions, eg, excessive accommodation fees, non-payment of compensation for Sunday working or of holiday-public holiday pay, etc. The inspectorate operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation with respect to nationality.</P>
    <P>Because of the restrictions necessitated by the recent foot and mouth disease crisis the inspectorate was constrained in pursuing certain cases, including following up on reports of mistreatment of certain workers in the agricultural, horticulture and food sector. Upon relaxation of the controls the Inspectorate has intensified its efforts in this area.</P>
    <P>In the event that evidence of non-compliance with labour legislation is found, my Inspectorate will seek redress for the individuals who have been mistreated and, if appropriate, prosecutions will be initiated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Strong economic and employment growth has resulted in substantial decline in unemployment and particularly long-term unemployment. Based on the most recent Quarterly National Household Survey, for the first quarter 2001, the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.7%, down from 4.7% one year earlier.</P>
      <P>There were 65,600 persons unemployed in the first quarter of 2001, an annual fall of nearly 16,000. Of that total, there are now just over 21,000 persons who are long-term unemployed based on the ILO measure. The fiscal and job-creation policies pursued by the Government in recent years have contributed to an overall reduction of 93,000 in the numbers unemployed since April 1997. Nevertheless there will always be an element of short-term unemployment in the economy. These persons represent a pool of unemployed who remain for short periods in unemployment pending their transition to a job.</P>
      <P>For persons who are long-term unemployed, studies indicate that such persons face multiple barriers to taking up work for example a lack of education and skills, misuse of drugs, literacy problems or age barriers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has in place a range of measures aimed at tackling remaining levels of unemployment, including through raising skills. Under the Preventive Strategy where unem<Col N="213" /> ployed persons are referred to FÁS, the supports provided to help them enhance their employability include education and training programme provision. There is available a large range and scale of active labour market programmes to assist in the re-integration of the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged in their transition to work, covering education, training and work experience. In addition to substantial FÁS supports, with total expenditure of £650 million in 2001, other Departments also have significant measures in place, including the &ldquo;Back to Work Allowance&rdquo; scheme operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the vocational education and training opportunities scheme, VTOS, by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The above represent some key elements of the overall employment and labour market strategic approach, as notified in the Employment Action Plan 2001 designed to match labour supply and demand. Nothwithstanding the considerable efforts and successes at integrating unemployed persons and other jobseekers into the open labour market, it is anticipated that some level of labour immigration will be required for the foreseeable future to meet the needs of the expanding economy.</P>
    <P>Based on trends in recent years, around half of the numbers of migrant workers joining the Irish workforce have been returning Irish people. Under the Treaties of the European Union, nationals of other member states have the right to take-up employment in Ireland on an equal basis with Irish citizens. In addition, employers may apply for work permits in those cases where non-European Economic Area, EEA, nationals are required to fill employment vacancies in Ireland. Last year, in the context of a very tight labour market, a work visa authorisation scheme was introduced to facilitate the recruitment of suitably qualified people from non-European Economic Area countries for designated sectors of the labour market where shortages were particularly acute.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that we are fully exploiting the domestic sources of additional labour supply. The unemployed and disadvantaged groups, together with increased female participation, will continue to be targeted as significant sources of labour supply. This is being complemented with a balanced focus on migration in the event that local sources are insufficient to meet the demand for labour and skills in the economy.</P>

      <P>However, I understand from Enterprise Ireland that the value of Enterprise Ireland's holdings in quoted technology companies at the beginning of January 2000 was £121 million.

      <P>An Action Plan 2000-2001 will protect consumers as far as possible against unwarranted price rises during the changeover to the euro, which I launched last December and which is being implemented by the Director of Consumer Affairs. The secretariat of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland was consulted when the action plan was being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key action under the plan relates to the dual display of prices: a special logo, to be associated with adherence to either the national code or approved, sectoral codes of practice on dual pricing, will be available from the Director of Consumer Affairs. Display of the logo means that the businesses concerned are publicly committed to carrying out the changeover fairly, without seeking any advantage from the conversion. Consumers should be able to feel confident that they will not be overcharged for goods or services where they see the logo on display. The Director of Consumer Affairs has written to over 200 trade associations, inviting them to sign up to the national code or to draw up a sectoral code of their own and seek the Director's approval for it. The Director's office is in the process of responding to close on 100 applications from potential individual subscribers to the national code. To date, nine companies and 10 trade associations have signed up to the code. In addition the Director has approved four sectoral codes, submitted to her by IBEC-EAN; the Irish <Col N="215" /> Petroleum Industry Association; the Irish Branch of the Booksellers Association of Great Britain and Ireland and the Insurance Federation of Ireland. A further two proposed sectoral codes are currently under active examination by the Director.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that consumers can contact the Director of Consumer Affairs with queries or complaints they may have on the euro at www.odcaeuroinfo@entemp.ie.</P>
    <P>Going beyond commitments developed at national level, under the action plan the idea of a voluntary commitment to overall price stability appears in the joint statement adopted on 02 April 2001 by representatives of the retail trades, SMEs and consumers in the eurozone: It states:</P>
    <P>Retailers undertake not to use the changeover to the euro to apply hidden price rises. They undertake to do their utmost to ensure the overall stability of their prices when converting them into euros and to publicise these commitments using appropriate communication tools. In order to reflect this commitment and to get the message across to consumers, they will use the European slogan &ldquo;new currency, stable prices&rdquo; as much as possible in all appropriate contexts.</P>
    <P>The full text of the joint statement is included at annex 3 to the report on the preparations in the eurozone for the introduction of euro notes and coins which is attached to the Commission Communication of 03 April 2001 and which can be accessed at: www.europa.eu.int/comm/economy</P>

      <P>The national authority for occupational safety and health, known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body with responsibility for the administration, monitoring and enforcement of occupational health and safety legislation. The carrying out of inspections and investigations is a day-to-day matter for the authority, as is the taking of enforcement action. I have no statutory function in this regard, and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on what enforcement action the authority may or may not consider in any specific case, as this could prejudice subsequent action which might ensue.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the call made at the Conference of the Association of Health Boards held in Bundoran on 27 April 2001 for additional funding and assistance for Irish immigrants in Britain; if she intends to provide any such additional funding or assistance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the call made at the Conference of the Association of Health Boards in Bundoran on 27 April 2001 for additional funding and assistance for Irish immigrants in Britain, and in particular, funding for voluntary organisations who assist Irish people who have health problems, including depression and mental health problems; and funding of repatriation programmes to assist elderly Irish people in Britain to return to live in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Funding for Irish emigrant welfare in Britain is provided through the Díon fund. Since 1984 the Irish Government has provided annual financial assistance under this fund to support Irish voluntary organisations in Britain who provide advisory and welfare services for Irish emigrants. Last year grants totalling £1,015,000 were paid to forty welfare organisations working with vulnerable and at risk' members of the Irish community in Britain. The Government has provided an additional £1 million for Díon this year to assist Irish people in Britain who are most in need, including those with health problems. This brings the total Díon allocation for 2001 to over £2 million &ndash; £2,051,000 &ndash; representing a new record level of support for this purpose.  This year's increase is the largest ever increase in the Díon fund and brings the total grant allocation since its inception in 1984 to almost £10 million.</P>
      <P>The Díon fund is provided from the Vote of my Department and it is administered by the Embassy of Ireland in London through the Díon Committee. In the main, Díon grants support the employment of professional workers in Irish voluntary organisations in Britain who provide advice and assistance over a range of areas, including housing and health and welfare entitlements, to both the newly arrived and to those who have been in Britain for some time, and in areas with significant Irish populations. Many of the welfare organisations funded by Díon assist elderly Irish people who are socially excluded and in poor health and circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, applications have been received from fifty seven voluntary organisations, and they <Col N="217" /> amount to over two and a half million Irish pounds. I will shortly be receiving the committee's grant recommendations for 2001. As usual, the grants will be paid to successful applicants in June.</P>
    <P>Since 1996 counselling-psychotherapy services were not eligible for Díon funding &ndash; in fact, such services were specifically excluded in the Díon Strategic Plan, 1998-2000. In drawing up its new strategic plan for 2001-2003, however, the Díon Committee have recommended that counselling costs be made eligible for Díon funding and that applications for funding for such services be considered on their merits. One such application has been received this year and has been considered for funding. A decision will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>The Bundoran Health Conference pointed to the need for Government support for repatriation of elderly Irish people who have been resident in Britain for many years. One such project was funded last year. The Safe Start Foundation which offers accommodation, employment opportunities and training to young Irish people in North West London, received a Díon grant of £16,000 for their &ldquo;Safe Home&rdquo; repatriation project to provide advice to elderly Irish people who wish to return to live in Ireland. This project has links with the Safe Home repatriation project in Mulranny, County Mayo. A number of Díon grant applications for repatriation projects were received this year, including one from the Mulranny project. Funding for there projects has been considered along with all the other applications received and a decision will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the Government is committed to establish a task force under the chairmanship of the Department of Foreign Affairs and comprising of social partner and other relevant interests, to develop a coherent long-term approach to Irish emigrants and their needs, building on the initiatives already being undertaken by that Department and by my Department, ie, the Díon fund. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is in the process of selecting members of the task force and setting terms of reference. Proposals will be put to the Government in the coming weeks. The issue of funding for services to Irish emigrants in Britain and elsewhere will be examined in this context.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Deputy &ndash; and, everybody in the House &ndash; will want to join me in the desire to ensure that introduction of the single currency <Col N="218" /> will be a positive experience for consumers, associated not with exploitation but, rather, with excitement at reaching the final stage of this momentous project for Europe, when citizens across the eurozone will have euro notes and coins in their pockets.</P>
      <P>We know that businesses are gearing themselves for the euro, but they need to prepare their customers as well. I would strongly urge them to subscribe to either the national code or to approved sectoral codes on dual display of prices. Subscribers will be entitled to display the special logo, which means they are committed to carrying out the changeover fairly without seeking any advantage from the conversion. This is an unambiguous, public undertaking not to engage in profiteering. Accordingly, consumers should feel confident that they will not be overcharged for goods or services where they see the logo on display.</P>
      <P>The national code is one of the key actions in the Action Plan, 2000 &ndash; 2001, aimed at protecting consumers as far as possible against unwarranted price rises during the changeover to the euro. The action plan, which I launched last December, is being implemented primarily by the Director of Consumer Affairs. It contains 17 specific actions in all, which are grounded in a strategy for increasing consumer confidence and empowerment. It may be of interest to know that the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs can be contacted about euro-specific concerns at odcaeuroinfo@entemp.ie.</P>
      <P>I have every expectation that consumer vigilance &ndash; backed up by initiatives such as the action plan and the various, on-going informational activities by the ECBI, Forfás, ODCA and ECC &ndash; will be instrumental in ensuring that consumers benefit from the introduction of the euro in notes and coins at the beginning of 2002, which should result in greater price transparency, further stimulating competition and increasing consumer choice.</P>

      <P>By way of clarification, I should point out that it is possible for credit unions to offer products under the special savings incentive accounts, SSIA, scheme. I understand that a large number of them are now doing so. However, the Irish League of Credit Unions have identified a provision in the Credit Union Act, 1997 which, in their view, is an impediment to promoting a particular kind of product and, after this matter was raised initially with the Department of Finance by the League in the context of discussions between them on the introduction of SSIAs, the League then wrote to me about it, given my responsibility for the Credit Union Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>The current position is that our officials, together with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, are considering different aspects of the matter and are in discussion with representatives of the League. If it becomes clear that the particular financial limit identified by the League, as set out in section 27(1)(b) of the Act, is a significant obstacle to full participation by the credit union movement in the Government's SSIA initiative, I will give consideration to amending it, having satisfied myself that to do so would not cause other difficulties regarding the preservation of the special character of credit unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 200,000 immigrant workers being necessary to achieve the growth targets set out in the national development plan, NDP, originated in a paper prepared by an economic consultant for Forfás. It formed the basis for the report of the Interdepartmental-Agency Group on Immigration Policy which was published in early 2000.</P>
      <P>The figure of 200,000 covered a seven year period 2000-2006 and was based on assumptions about the relationship between economic growth and employment growth in the period of the NDP. Other factors such as participation rates and emigration rates from Ireland were also used in the calculations.</P>
      <P>The report of the interdepartmental-agency group noted that a continuation of the immigration trends experienced in the late 1990's would suffice to meet our needs. It also noted that, based on recent experience, some 50% of those coming to Ireland would be Irish persons returning. However, the residual pool of Irish abroad both able and willing to return to Ireland is likely to be smaller in the next few years.</P>
      <P>More recently, the FÁS-ESRI manpower forecasting study, published in April of this year, which for the first time forecast manpower needs based on likely labour flows over the period, estimated that perhaps slightly more than 150,000 immigrant workers would be required in the period to 2006, depending on growth rates.</P>
      <P>In light of the varying projections and of the very high growth and employment figures experienced between 1999 and the present, I have requested my Department prepare a more up-to-date estimate of the extent to which our labour needs will need to be met by immigration in the period to 2006.</P>
      <P>In the meantime we will continue to advertise overseas the possibilities of work in Ireland and to facilitate the recruitment of such personnel by employers, as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of reports regarding the mistreatment of certain non-nationals placed in employment here on foot of work permit applications. In this connection I am already on record as saying that I do not intend to preside over a situation whereby a small number of employers will be allowed to get away with the exploitation of vulnerable people and I unreservedly condemn any abuses of the statutory employment rights and protections that immigrant workers may have been subjected to.</P>
      <P>Employment rights legislation in Ireland establishes the minimum statutory rights applicable to all 1.8 million people working in Ireland whether part-time or full-time, high or low skill, national or non-national. Labour related legislation makes no distinction between the rights of foreign workers and any other workers. All workers in Ireland, without exception, are entitled to the same statutory employment rights and protections, so the protections of Irish labour law apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as to native Irish workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fundamental tenet of my Department's approach to employment rights that the statutory rights and entitlements of all who work in Ireland will continue to be assured and enforced and that effective mechanisms by which they can vindicate their legal rights will be provided. The labour inspectorate of my Department has an ongoing responsibility for monitoring the employment <Col N="223" /> conditions of various categories of vulnerable workers, including immigrant workers. In this regard the inspectorate can pursue allegations of workers being subjected to excessive working hours, illegal deductions, non-payment of compensation for Sunday working or of holiday/public holiday pay, etc. The inspectorate operates objectively, fairly, impartially and without any differentiation with respect to nationality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance in their stability programme published on budget-day in December last, taking account of the full range of economic assumptions, forecast employment growth of 60,000, 37,000 and 31,000, respectively, in the period 2001-2003, average annual labour force growth of 2.2% over the three-year period, and a further fall in the unemployment rate to 3.2%.</P>
      <P>Thus, over the medium term, the economy is projected to slow appreciably from the recent highs, while unemployment is projected to remain around 3 %, suggesting that the labour market will remain tight for the foreseeable future. These economic projections reflect the available information available at that time and as a consequence they do not take account of the subsequent slowdown in the US economy nor any longer term impact from foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>Based on these assumptions, policies and actions are currently in place which represent a concerted effort to meet the labour and skill needs of the economy. The twin strategy being adopted is to provide supports and mobilise labour supply from all available sources, including immigration, and to provide the necessary education, training and lifelong learning opportunities to ensure that employed persons and those seeking employment have the required skills. The policy mix to implement this strategy is set out in the Employment Action Plan 2001. Key aspects of the policy mix and actions set out in the employment action plan include: fiscal policies, including personal tax reductions, aimed at enhancing the reward from work; the preventive strategy which intervenes at an early stage of unemployment to offer persons a job or support in the transition to a job, which is aimed at preventing the drift to long-term unemployment; a wide range of active labour market programmes to re-integrate the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged groups, especially people suffering from disabilities, into employment; fiscal and training policies aimed at increasing the participation of women in the labour market; a wide range of education and training policies aimed at increasing the skill levels in the economy. In particular the introduction of the national training fund heralds a new approach to investment in training in and for the business sector to enhance labour quality; a more liberal immigration regime to facilitate workers from outside the European Economic Area, EEA, to take up employment opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within that policy mix, FÁS has a major role <Col N="227" /> to play in meeting the labour and skills needs of the economy, including in the event of job losses in particular sectors or companies.</P>
    <P>FÁS operates a wide range and scale of programmes under three main headings. The employment and placement service seeks to mobilise labour supply and to match job seekers with available vacancies and to prevent unemployed persons drifting into long-term unemployment. Expenditure on this service in 2001 is estimated at £38 million. FÁS operates a range of training programmes and services to business to ensure that the skills are available to match the needs of the economy. Expenditure on training, for both persons in employment and job seekers, is estimated at over £172 million in 2001.</P>
    <P>In addition FÁS operates temporary work experience programmes, notably community employment, which are designed to encourage unemployed persons to progress to the open labour market. More than £412 million of expenditure is estimated in 2001 under this heading.</P>
    <P>Taking all of the above into account I am satisfied that the wide range of policies in place will ensure the adequacy of supply in meeting the labour and skill needs of the economy in the period ahead and that FÁS has sufficient resources to play its part in this area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 120, 129 and 130 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> Many of the recent jobs losses which have occurred are as a result of the restructuring process which is going on in industry in Ireland whereby activities, and hence jobs, at the lower end of the value-added scale are being phased out, as these activities become uneconomic in an Irish context.</P>
    <P>The most vulnerable jobs in Ireland are those in relatively low-skill areas, where Ireland is becoming an uncompetitive location for manufacturing. As companies located in Ireland continually upgrade their activities in response to the ever-changing economic environment in which they operate, this can sometimes result in a relocation of lower value-added activities to lower wage economies. In this respect a primary element of the policy implemented by the development agencies is to assist client companies to move up the value chain, from being, basically, mandated subsidiary operations to being strategically independent operations within their corporate structures world-wide. This will result in activities requiring higher skilled employees which will help to create more secure employment into the future.</P>
    <P>The agencies seek to ensure that as jobs are lost at the lower end of the scale, they are more than compensated for by greater numbers of jobs at the higher end. This process has been more than successful over the past decade.</P>
    <P>The slowdown in the US economy is having a negative but limited impact on the overseas owned manufacturing sector in Ireland. The impact has been confined to the information technology related sectors to date and our base of companies in this sector is relatively young and focused on higher value products, often incorporating functions such as customer-technical support, software development, and logistics, which make them less vulnerable than basic manufacturing plants.</P>
    <P>As regards developments in the world economy, those that may affect Ireland in a positive way are; interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the US Federal reserve; evidence that the EU economy is continuing to grow moderately, despite the downturns in the US and Japanese economies, and the continuing low rate of price inflation in OECD economies.</P>
    <P>To take advantage of positive developments such as these we must continue to focus on those factors over which we have some control, and which impact significantly on the competitiveness of Ireland as a base for investment. These issues include implementing the national development plan on schedule, particularly the rollout of infrastructure into the regions, wage and price inflation, ensuring a stable industrial relations environment and addressing the important question of skills supply.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>Since the transposition into Irish law of the EU Third Framework Insurance Directives in 1994, insurance companies authorised in any member state may provide insurance cover throughout the entire EU on the basis of their home country authorisation. This has opened up the Irish market to competition from insurance providers in other EU countries. In addition, I removed the cap on brokers' commission to encourage further competition in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>The decision of this Government to establish a personal injuries assessment board, by next year, seeks to address the issue of the high cost of settling claims by achieving a reduction in the delivery cost of personal injury compensation for work related injuries, in its initial phase, and later in road injury cases. This may also help to make the Irish market more attractive to insurers based in other EU member states, thereby increasing competition in the market.</P>
      <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board will be reporting to me later this year and following that, I will take whatever further action is appropriate towards the goals of reducing the cost of motor insurance and increasing competitiveness in the marketplace.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> The insurance Bill was discussed at length during last year, with the various interest groups involved, including the Professional Insurance Brokers Association. It was signed into law on December 20, last, becoming the Insurance Act, 2000. A commencement order was subsequently made bringing into effect various sections of the Act. The Part which amended the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, to allow for the transfer of regulatory responsibility for insurance intermediaries to the Central Bank, came into effect on the first of April last.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Central Bank issued consultation documents and engaged in intensive consultations with the insurance brokers associations in relation to the bank's taking up of regulatory responsibility for insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>While the regulation of insurance intermediaries is now strictly a matter for the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, I have recently chaired a meeting, attended by representatives of the insurance brokers associations and other interested parties, held in the context of further consultations being undertaken by the Central Bank. In my opinion, the meeting was a valuable positive contribution to the process of consultation being undertaken by the Central Bank. I understand that consultations are continuing in a satisfactory manner for all of the partners involved.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has agreed to pro<Col N="231" /> posals for the establishment of a new structure for financial services regulation in Ireland. The proposals include the drawing up of legislation to provide <i>inter alia</i> for the establishment of a financial services Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the current role of the Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland will be incorporated into that new Office. There will be further consultation and discussion between our Department and the Department of Finance on the best way to improve services to consumers in the financial services area, in the context of the establishment of a Financial Services Ombudsman. The new Irish financial services regulatory authority will itself have a strong consumer protection role and a separate statutory post of consumer protection director.</P>

      <P>Over the past three years, a total of 11 new head office undertakings have been authorised to write non-life insurance. In addition, four branch offices of foreign insurers entered the Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the transposition into Irish law of the EU Third Framework Insurance Directives in 1994, insurance companies authorised in any member state may provide insurance cover throughout the entire EU on the basis of their home country authorisation. This has opened up the Irish market to competition from insurance providers in <Col N="232" /> other EU countries. In the past three years, our Department has been notified of the intention of an additional 16 non-life insurers based in other EU member states to conduct business into the Irish market on a services basis.</P>
    <P>The new entrants to the market have been offset, to some extent, by take-overs and mergers of insurance groups at international level that have impacted on the Irish market through the consequent effect on subsidiary companies here. In addition, some insurers have ceased writing business in the market, mainly in the area of branch offices. Our policy is to see that as much competition as possible continues to take place on the Irish market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year my Department launched a number of important publications dealing with sustainable forest management in Ireland. These publications are: The Irish National Forest Standard; The Code of Best Forest Practice &ndash; Ireland; Forestry and the Landscape Guidelines; Forestry and Archaeology Guidelines; Forest Biodiversity Guidelines; Forestry and Water Quality Guidelines; Forest Harvesting Guidelines.  </P>
      <P>Copies of all of these publications have been placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of members.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the launch of the SFM publications a series of SFM workshops were held throughout the country, funded by the Forest Service and run in conjunction with Coillte Teoranta. Representatives of Coillte and the other forestry companies attended these workshops.</P>
      <P>A SFM monitoring group has also been established within my Department and included in its remit is the promotion and implementation of the principles of SFM, including biodiversity, in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> The new forest biodiversity guidelines recognise the importance of the maintenance and enhancement of forest biodiversity, and implement the objectives of the national biodiversity plan in a forestry context.</P>
    <P>They describe a range of measures to conserve and enhance biodiversity in forests, such as species and structural diversity, retained habitats and open spaces, the retention of deadwood, the control of troublesome species such as rhododendron, and the use and conservation of native provenances.</P>
    <P>Compliance with these guidelines is a condition of grant aid. The Forest Service monitors adherence to the guidelines through site inspections. It is worth noting that virtually all forestry planting in Ireland is grant aided under the afforestation grants and premium scheme and all payments under the scheme are contingent on compliance with the environmental guidelines.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the damage recorded in the Glencar catchment through the failure of Coillte Teoranta to install effective silt traps before clearfelling as recorded in the north west Fisheries Board's annual report for 2000; and, if so, the actions he intends to take to ensure that Coillte Teoranta observes the relevant forest service guidelines.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>An episode of flash flooding occurred in the Glencar area in June 2000. Much of the evidence washed away. However, it would appear that some sedimentation may have occurred and Coillte Teo undertook remedial action in consultation with the relevant regional fisheries board. This incident predated the release of the current forestry and water quality, and forest harvesting and the environment guidelines which were published in September 2000.</P>
      <P>I understand from Coillte Teoranta that as a result of the unforeseen weather event, the prevailing silt control facilities could not cope with the resulting deluge. In consultation with the relevant regional fisheries board more elaborate sediment traps were put in place.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the environmental inspector from my Department inspected the site and found that there were sufficient silt traps in place for the forestry operation under way. The aquatic zone, within and in the vicinity of the forest, was inspected and found to be clear of all silt and sedimentation.</P>
      <P>Strict adherence to all five guidelines is an essential pre-requisite of grant-aid approval and the award of felling licences. Officials from my Department inspect Coillte felling sites, on a sample basis as part of an annual environmental audit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1950's the Glengarriff area was predominantly covered by broadleaf trees. Some of these areas were cleared and restocked with exotic conifer species. As many are now reaching maturity they are being harvested by Coillte and will be replanted by Dúchas with broadleaf species.</P>
      <P>In 2000, two felling proposals for limited felling licences relating to the area in question covering circa 11.8 ha were referred to Cork County Council and Dúchas the Heritage Service, Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands &ndash; the relevant environmental authorities in these cases for their environmental observations. Neither expressed objections to the proposals as long as native broadleaf trees were not damaged and siltation of the streams was avoided. This condition was included in the felling licence which issued. Subsequently a further felling authorisation issued in April 2001 covering an area of 22 hectares which will facilitate the planting of broadleaf trees by Dúchas.</P>
      <P>My Department has received no complaints from Dúchas or the regional fisheries board in relation to the harvesting operation in the Glengarriff area. I have, however, on foot of the Deputy's question, asked for a detailed report on the matter.</P>
      <P>Strict adherence to all five environmental guidelines, published in September 2000, including those relating to forestry and water quality and forest harvesting and the environment guidelines, is a condition of felling licences awarded since that date.</P>
      <P>An EIA relating to tree felling is required when an excess of ten hectares of broadleaf high forest is replaced by conifer species. This criteria was not applicable in the case in question.</P>

      <P>Within the ICAO environmental issues associated with civil aviation are largely undertaken through its Committee on Aviation Environment Protection which was established in 1983 and reports directly to the council of the ICAO. Over the years the CAEP has developed a number of refinements to the noise certification procedures for all types of aircraft, noise measurements and calculation procedures and amendments on engine emissions. ICAO measures in this area are governed by ICAO Annex 16 to the Chicago Convention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> I have been advised by Iarnród Éireann that, consistent with the DTO plan to upgrade Dublin suburban rail services, it plans to provide for an increase in the number and size of DART trains. This will require improvements in signalling, increased traction power and the lengthening of platforms to accommodate eight car DART trains after 2002. As part of this next phase of development, Iarnród Éireann is planning to purchase 36 additional DART cars.</P>
    <P>My Department has allocated £3.5 million in 2001 in respect of the design and planning of this project. Further details of the timescale of the project will be determined as the planning and design progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The military authorities advise that anyone who is registered as being in excess of 21 days absent without authorisation from the Defence Forces is defined as an illegal absentee. On being registered as being illegally absent, notification is sent by the unit concerned to the military police and to the Garda inspector of the district in which the individual would normally reside. Thereafter, in consultation with the Garda, the military police will visit the last known address of the individual and, if found, he or she will be detained by them and returned to his or her unit.</P>
      <P>The procedure in military law with regard to such absentees is that a court of inquiry is held pursuant to section 147 of the Defence Act in respect of each such absentee. A record would exist in the service books of each unit to the effect that the person concerned had been declared to be absent without leave from a specific date. Pursuant to the provisions of section 135(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Defence Act that person is also presumed to have deserted the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>There is a simple procedure available for long-term absentees to surrender themselves and for trial to be dispensed with. Where such an application for dispensation on humanitarian grounds is approved by the deputy chief of staff, the applicant is then required to contact the officer commanding his unit and make arrangements to surrender and make a formal confession of desertion. A pragmatic and sensible approach is taken to the question of long-term absentees, particularly as many of these individuals are, by definition, well advanced in years.</P>
      <P>Each case is treated on its merits in accordance with the procedures outlined. However, the military authorities do consider all relevant mitigating circumstances evident in each case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently, overpayments are being recovered from the early retirement pensions of just over 1,000 participants in the scheme. The average overpayment is approximately £2,000. In the majority of cases the overpayment arose because the participant did not, as required of them by the scheme, advise my Department of the receipt of a national retirement pension from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Under the EU regulations governing both the 1994 and the new schemes, the early retirement pension is payable as a supplement to any national retirement pension to which the participant is entitled and the amount of such pension must be deducted from the early retirement pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such overpayments, which are debts owed to the EU, must be recovered. Where they cannot <Col N="244" /> be recovered fully by withholding future payments due to participants in the early retirement scheme, my Department is prepared to agree repayment terms that will not cause undue hardship to the people concerned. In the absence of such agreements my Department has to take other measures to recover the debts.</P>
    <P>While the onus is on participants in the scheme to notify my Department if they or their partners in joint management are awarded an old age pension, a significant number failed to do so and this has given rise to substantial debts. Procedures are now in place to avoid such overpayments in the future. Participants are now advised three months in advance of their 66th birthday that they must apply to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs for both the contributory and non-contributory old age pension and notify my Department of that Department's decision. If no response is received from applicants before their 66th birthday payment of the early retirement pension is suspended pending confirmation of their entitlement to the old age pension.</P>
    <P>A system of information exchange between my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has also been introduced to identify cases where a national retirement pension is in payment.</P>

      <P>It should be recalled that the foot and mouth disease animal movement permitting systems were designed initially with a view to minimising the risk of spreading the disease through animal movements and contact between high risk groups such as farmers. It was decided to use fax, telephone and post as the principal means of communication. I am not convinced that a change is warranted to the current arrangements at this stage as I believe that the system is operating well and that delays and hardship are not being imposed on applicants. Since the system commenced on 14 May over 38,800 permits have been issued in respect of 194,000 cattle.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that yesterday I announced further relaxations in the animal movement controls, including the permitting regime which will apply from Monday next.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the inequity being suffered by those people who are offering home help through the health boards and are being charged tax on the income which they receive; if he will examine the matter to see if home help payments could be declared exempt from income tax; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17473/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a principle of the taxation system that, in general, all income is reckonable in determining a person's income tax liability. In relation to home helps, in view of the low level of pay and the fact that many of them did not have any taxable income and would have been entitled to the PAYE allowance, Revenue decided many years ago to exclude payments to them from the PAYE system of taxation until further notice. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that, from time to time, they monitored the average amounts paid to home helps.</P>
      <P>The rate of pay to home helps has been reviewed and an agreement was concluded between the employers and the home help representatives. The revised rate of pay from 1 January 2000 is £5 per hour increasing to the group 1 non-nursing rate from 1 January 2001. The increases resulted in home helps having an hourly rate of pay which is higher than many employees who currently pay tax under the PAYE system. Consequently, it was necessary to bring home helps within the PAYE system of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the implementation from 6 April of the increase in tax credits that I announced in budget 2001, the first £144 of weekly income is free from tax in the case of a single person on PAYE. In the case of a married couple with one income on PAYE the first £308 per week is free from tax where the taxpayer is entitled to the home carer's tax credit; otherwise the weekly <Col N="246" /> income made free from tax for a married couple with one income is £250. Income in excess of these amounts, which is subject to tax, is taxed at a rate 2% less than the rate in the last tax year as a result of the reductions in tax rates announced in budget 2001. In my Budget Statement I also indicated that in the next budget the Government intends to increase the entry point to the taxation system towards the level of the minimum wage.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these factors, I do not propose that special arrangements be made in relation to the situation outlined by the Deputy. However, I will bear it in mind in the context of overall plans with respect to income tax matters to be outlined in my Budget Statement for 2002.</P>

      <P>I am committed to the development of a structured and quality based general practice out of hours service. Consistent with this approach, my Department is funding two major pilot out of hours projects in the NEHB and SEHB. It was always the clear and stated intention that no further projects would be commenced before those projects were fully and independently evaluated. The first phase of the evaluation process will be completed in late June and will facilitate a full consideration of how further progress can be made in this area. It will also allow a decision to be made on whether the co-op model is the best model for out of hours service delivery.</P>
      <P>It was for these reasons that no commitment was made to the Mid-Western Health Board for the introduction or funding of an out of hours project in that region this year. However, the board received £140,000 to facilitate work on progressing the infrastructural issues surrounding the development of a structured out of hours general practitioner model in their area. It has used some of that money to employ a full-time project manager. He is currently working with a geographically representative steering group of ten GPs in the region to ensure the fullest involvement of local GPs in this important area.</P>
      <P>Given a positive outcome to the evaluation process I hope to be in a position, in association with the Mid-Western Health Board, to fund this project.</P>

      <P>The Forum on Medical Manpower was established to examine problems, including inappropriate staffing, limited availability of senior clinical decision-making and obstacles which arise in medical career structures. The forum's draft report was presented to the Minister for Health and Children at the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>Both the forum's report and the report on non-consultant hospital doctors' working hours were recently considered by Government. The Government has decided to establish a national task force to prepare a detailed implementation programme on reducing NCHD working hours and to quantify the resource implications and costs arising from both reports. The results of these studies will be the subject of a further memorandum to Government. The Government has also approved the commencement of negotiations with the relevant parties on the core issues arising from the reports. The first meeting took place on 7 June. There are likely to be very significant financial and staffing implications which must first be quantified and then carefully considered by Government. The report of the medical manpower forum states that its recommendations should be quantified and costed and does not specify the number of consultants required.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance has a central role in the administration of Government given its responsibility in relation to public expenditure and the need to secure optimum social and economic benefits. The Department fulfils this role by negotiating the annual allocations for each Department through the Estimates process. Consideration of additional investment on the scale proposed in these reports must involve the Department of Finance and this is the case whenever a Department seeks additional funding to develop its services.</P>

      <P>On 30 May I met the Irish Medical Organisation in relation to the ongoing implementation of the non-consultant hospital doctors agreement, 2000. Many issues were addressed during the course of this meeting, in particular the ongoing difference in interpretation regarding the application of overtime rates. Again I requested that the matter should be referred to the Labour Relations Commission for its considered view. Both the HSEA and my Department agree to accept the outcome of such clarification by the LRC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to highlight again the fact that £90 million in additional funding has been allocated to <Col N="251" /> NCHDs in the current year. There has been, and will continue to be, very significant investment in the terms and conditions applicable to NCHDs. Further progress in this regard was reached at the meeting on 30 May.</P>
    <P>The NCHD training grant will be applied to the purchase of laptops with up to a maximum of £1,500 payable from the training grant once in every three year period. It was clarified that those specialist registrars who undertake research as an obligatory part of their training programme are entitled to the £3,000 training grant per annum.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has also been made in relation to the appointment of medical manpower managers. A highly successful Health Service Employers Agency and Department of Health and Children seminar for medical manpower managers took place on 28 and 29 May. As many as 16 of the new managers attended. The seminar covered areas ranging from the working hours and medical manpower reports to the NCHD contract, the management of change and local consultation with NCHDs.</P>
    <P>A review of current local consultation arrangements took place at the seminar and the need to pro-actively address this issue was recognised. To this end the IMO has agreed to furnish a list of its representatives in individual hospitals to facilitate a more proactive and successful institutionalisation of this consultative mechanism.</P>

The initial 12 months of the programme is being called the first phase, as opposed to a pilot programme, to indicate that it is intended to further develop it in years to come, following an evaluation of the first phase. However, this is a large and complex undertaking and it will be important to learn as many lessons as possible from the first phase which can then be applied as the programme is expanded.</P>
      <P>The evaluation of the first phase of the programme of structured care in general practice of patients with cardiovascular disease will permit more accurate quantification of the workload involved and the resources required to deliver the service. In addition, the progress evaluation will collect the views of all those involved, especially patients, GPs and practice nurses as to how the system can be improved before it is expanded. This evaluation will be carried out as part of the first phase and will permit the implementation of a more effective and efficient service to patients as the programme is further expanded. My Department will provide the manpower and monetary resources. A total of £2 million has been set aside nationally for this purpose in 2001.</P>

      <P>The Plan for Women's Health is the blueprint for improving and developing the health care services required by women and has as its main objectives: to maximise the health and social gain <Col N="255" /> of Irish women; to create a women-friendly health service and to increase consultation with and representation of women in health services. In accordance with a recommendation contained in the plan, the Women's Health Council was established on a statutory basis in 1997. Its mission is to inform and influence the development of health policy to ensure the maximum health and social gain for women in Ireland. While the health services are not organised on a gender specific basis there are a number of initiatives currently in operation specifically aimed at increasing the life expectancy of women.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, was formally launched on 10 October 2000. Phase I of the programme covers the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board area and will target 136,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64 which represents approximately 50% of the national target population. Phase II of the programme will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>Phase 1 of the national cervical screening programme commenced in the Mid-Western Health Board in October 2000. Under phase 1, approximately 67,000 women in the 25-60 age group will be screened free of charge at minimum intervals of five years. The extension of the programme to the rest of the country and the establishment of a structure to manage the national programme are currently being examined by an expert group and the chief executive officers of the health boards.</P>
      <P>Ante-natal and post-natal care is provided through the maternity and infant care scheme, which provides an agreed programme of care to an expectant mother arising out of her pregnancy and to her new-born baby for six weeks after birth. The scheme is free of charge and is available to all women regardless of means.</P>
      <P>While not specifically targeted at women, campaigns such as National Healthy Eating Week and Ireland Needs a Change of Heart will help to create awareness of the benefits of a healthy lifestyle for both men and women.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there are variations in the rate of caesarean section among different maternity units. My Department's chief medical officer sought the views of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the matter.</P>
      <P>The institute has advised that an increase and variation in caesarean section rates is also evident in many European countries. Reasons for the increase include the widespread use of electronic monitoring of the foetal heart and earlier intervention for deviations of the foetal heart from the normal pattern. Other reasons include more women with previous caesarean section and induction of labour in the primigravidia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institute has recommended that maternity <Col N="258" /> hospitals carry out a prospective audit of delivery by caesarean section. The masters of the maternity hospitals have also been asked to agree on an identical audit of caesarean sections.</P>

      <P>An expert consultative group which was established to advise my Department on the development of the programme submitted its draft report on 31 May 2001. The report has been sent for external peer review to the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle and to Wytenshaw Hospital, Manchester.</P>
      <P>The Mater Hospital, Dublin, has been designated as the surgical site for the programme. The provision of a transplant unit forms part of a major capital development at the Mater Hospital under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>Pending the establishment of an Irish based programme, an agreement has been entered into with the Freeman Hospital for the treatment of Irish patients requiring a lung or heart and lung transplant. Thirteen transplants have been performed on Irish patients at the Freeman Hospital since 1 April 1999. One hundred and eighteen persons have been referred for assessment and three are actively awaiting admission for transplant subject to donor availability and matching.</P>

      <P>The figures requested by the Deputy are shown in the tabular statement. These figures have been extracted from the annual financial statements of the health boards. The 1999 figures for the Eastern Health Board, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board are unaudited. However, it is unlikely that these figures will change significantly on audit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grade category of management-adminis<Col N="263" /> trative also includes staff who are of direct service to patients, such as consultants' secretaries, community welfare officers, out-patient department personnel, ward clerks, medical records personnel and telephonists who are engaged in front line duties.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the purpose of many of the staff classified as management-administrative is to support front line professionals in carrying out their duties more efficiently. Health professionals, especially consultants and nurse managers, require clerical support and request such appointments on an ongoing basis. The strengthening of the accountability of health boards in the context of the accountability legislation of 1996 has led to the strengthening of finance departments also. In addition, improvements in risk management, human resource management and health and safety practices have contributed to a growth in the management-administrative area.</P>

      <P>Depreciation is not charged as expenditure to the income and expenditure account, but is calculated on capital assets and taken into account in the balance sheet by way of the capitalisation account. This ensures that the assets are appropriately valued in the accounts.</P>
      <P>Depreciation allows businesses to charge, across the lifetime of the asset, the economic cost of its use to the business. However, capital investment is fully met by the Department of Health and Children through the national development plan. If depreciation were charged as an expenditure item throughout the economic life of the asset, the Exchequer would technically be paying twice for the same asset.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital in-patient waiting list data for the Western Health Board area, as at 31 December 2000, the latest date for which figures are available show that there were 106 patients waiting for hip replacements at hospitals in the Western Health Board area and that there were 144 patients waiting for cataract procedures at hospitals in the area. Of those waiting for hip <Col N="266" /> replacements, 76 patients are waiting between three and 12 months and 30 patients are waiting longer than 12 months. Of those waiting for cataract procedures, 77 patients are waiting between three and 12 months and 67 patients are waiting over 12 months.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. Following recommendations in the Moran Report, Review of Orthodontic Services, structural changes are being introduced in orthodontic services. These structural changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. Additional funding of £5.3 million has been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private orthodontists to treat patients.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that the number of patients awaiting assessment and treatment at 31 March 2001 were as follows:</P>

      <P>From January 2001, revised and more flexible <Col N="267" /> procedures for approving overall employment levels in the health services have been put in place. These new arrangements, linked directly to the health service agencies' service plans, delegate greater responsibility to health board management in respect of employment levels, encouraging them to plan and manage their staff resources consistent with their service plan. Therefore, decisions in relation to the number of staff required in each service area is primarily a matter for each of the health boards or authorities.</P>
      <P>On this basis, I have referred the matter to the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board for direct reply to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Mullaghmore sewerage scheme was sixth on the list of waste water schemes submitted by Sligo County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002, announced last July. Given the priority afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include the Mullaghmore scheme in the programme. The three year programme will be rolled forward one year on an annual basis with the addition of new schemes. The Mullaghmore scheme will continue to be considered in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Ms Coughlan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1992, a contract was agreed between the then Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and O'Brien Shipping Limited to provide a passenger and cargo ferry service between Galway and the Aran Islands for the five year period from 1 September 1992 to 31 August 1997. The initial annual cost to the Exchequer of this contract was £475,000. However, this was later increased to £550,000 with effect from 19 April 1994 to take account of <Col N="271" /> inflation, extra operational costs and the cost of essential equipment required for the service.</P>
      <P>Included in the aforementioned contract, which was inherited by my Department in 1997, was a clause allowing for its possible extension for a further five year period after 31 August 1997 provided that agreement on this could be reached between the parties to the contract. In this context, officials of my Department, in 1997, entered into negotiations with O'Brien Shipping Limited with a view to extending the contract for a further five years. During the course of these negotiations, however, it became clear to my officials that the cost to the Exchequer of an extended contract could be reduced if the extension was to cover a period greater than five years. As a result of this, a seven year extension of the contract was agreed at the considerably reduced annual cost of £475,000.</P>
      <P>The current contract with O'Brien Shipping Limited contains a clause that the company shall submit to the Minister annually a copy of its audited accounts. I have received audited annual accounts for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 and am awaiting those in respect of 2000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 205 and 206 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that an application for a Garda CCTV system in Portlaoise town has been received by the advisory committee which was established by the Commissioner to evaluate applications for Garda CCTV systems. The application from Portlaoise is currently under consideration &ndash; as indeed are applications from other cities and towns throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime/public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management; any special circumstances/needs that exist; and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system to that area. Co-funding is a feature of Garda CCTV systems and this is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Garda CCTV expansion programme, a total of £12 million has been allocated <Col N="274" /> towards the installation of CCTV systems nationwide over the next three years &ndash; with £4 million being allocated in 2001. As part of the first tranche, Garda CCTV systems are to be installed in the following 10 locations: Athlone, Bray, Clondalkin, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Tallaght. At least a further six areas will commence in 2003 and they will be announced in due course. It is anticipated that the ten CCTV systems referred to above will be installed in the period 2001/2002.</P>

      <P>Recent appointments of additional psychologists to the eastern &ndash; east coast &ndash; region have enabled NEPS to enhance considerably its service in County Wicklow. All primary and post-primary schools in the east coast region of the county have access to the NEPS service, with the exception of less than ten schools in the very south of the county. The service is also being offered for the first time to a number of schools in west Wicklow. More psychologists will be appointed to NEPS during the coming months. It should be possible during the autumn to extend the service to practically all schools in County Wicklow and also to decrease the number of schools assigned to each psychologist, thereby improving the level of service.</P>

      <P>The additional psychologists who have been appointed since September 2000 have allowed NEPS to begin the process of expanding the psychological service in the south eastern region. When all schools in County Carlow have access to the NEPS service there will be up to six psychologists serving counties Carlow and Kilkenny. All post-primary schools in County Carlow have access to the service provided by NEPS, but it has not yet been possible to extend <Col N="277" /> the service to primary schools. I have been informed that NEPS is having some difficulty recruiting staff for certain parts of the country, including County Carlow. NEPS has therefore designated the county as a high priority for expansion, particularly for the assignment of staff due for appointment during the rest of this year.</P>
      <P>Pending full expansion of its service, NEPS has been examining what alternative measures can be taken to respond to urgent requests for psychological assessment in individual cases. I recently announced the allocation of £1.25 million for NEPS to purchase private assessment services for schools that do not yet have access to its service. Details of the new initiative are being developed by NEPS and will be communicated to schools before the end of June.</P>

      <P>The operation of the public mobile library service for primary schools is a matter for the various local authorities and, accordingly, it is a matter for each of them to provide a mobile library service for the schools in its area. My Department has no involvement in the operation of this service. However my Department does make a grant available to each local authority on an annual basis to enable their librarians select, purchase, and deliver books to the primary schools. The grant is based on the number of pupils enrolled in primary schools in each local authority area. The value of the grant in 2001 is £1.037 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The library service is essential for schools in rural areas, where pupils do not have ready access to public library facilities and also for pupils in disadvantaged areas who normally are not motivated to read at home. The Department of Environment and Local Government has established a working group on the schools library service. My Department, the library council and local authority librarians are also represented on the group. One of the terms of reference of the group is to consider the role of the public library service in the operation of the schools library service. The group has already held a number of meetings and will continue to meet over the coming months. If the Deputy wishes to provide further details <Col N="279" /> regarding the matter raised in his question, I will ensure that it is brought to the attention of the working group.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the need to ensure that all schools have access to proper library facilities and resources. In this regard, in recent years, two grants have issued from my Department directly to primary and post-primary schools to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. The first grant was called a library grant and was issued by my Department in December 1998. At that time all primary schools received a grant of £1,000 per school, while schools designated as disadvantaged received £3,170 each. The grant that issued to second level schools in December 1998 amounted to £2,500, while disadvantaged schools received £5,320. A second grant issued to all primary and post-primary schools in December 1999 as part of the national reading initiative. Under the terms of this grant, primary schools received a payment of £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £462 was issued to all schools with 60 pupils or less. <Col N="280" /> Post primary schools also received £7.70 per pupil, while a minimum grant of £1,540 was paid to all schools with less than 200 recognised pupils. At primary level the total value of these two grants was approximately £7.7 million, while at second level the two grants amounted to £5.2 million</P>
