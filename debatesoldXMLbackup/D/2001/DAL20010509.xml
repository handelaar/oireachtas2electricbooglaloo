    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress continues to be made in implementing the wide-ranging set of commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This is borne out by the fourth PPF progress report produced for the social partners plenary meeting held on 26 April, copies of which have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plenary meeting dealt, in the first place, with the foot and mouth crisis, the Government's <Col N="1398" /> handling of which was strongly supported by all the social partners. For my part, I would like to record the Government's sincere appreciation for the solidarity shown by all sectors and the public alike in addressing this issue of national importance. I would also like to take this opportunity to stress the need for continuing vigilance in the face of what is still a very serious threat to the economy. The 26 April plenary meeting also dealt in considerable detail with the themes of tackling social exclusion and promoting equality. Significant progress has been made in these areas and we are well on the way to implementing the full range of relevant commitments in the PPF.</P>
    <P>While I have regular contact with the social partners individually, the next PPF plenary meeting will take place on 26 July. I will chair that meeting and the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance will also be present. The principal items on the agenda will be competitiveness, housing and waste management. In accordance with normal practice, the meeting will also afford the opportunity to review progress and deal with any issues of particular concern at that time.</P>
    <P>The national implementation body was established on foot of the 4 December agreed adjustment to the terms of the PPF. Its purpose is to ensure delivery of the stability and peace provisions of the programme. In that context, it considers, in particular, the potential implications for the PPF of any ongoing disputes of special national importance and is doing useful work in this area. Responsibility for the resolution of disputes, however, continues to rest primarily with the parties concerned and the pre-existing industrial relations machinery of the State, as necessary. To date, the body has not incurred any costs to my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Members of this House would consider that the primary responsibility of social partnership is to ensure smooth industrial relations. On the second day of the rail dispute, with 100,000 people stranded yesterday and 25,000 people stranded in Munster today, and people not getting to work or to hospital for essential medical appointments, does the Taoiseach not believe it is time to abandon the &ldquo;head in the sand&rdquo; approach adopted by his Minister who feels she has no function in this matter? Does he not believe it is the responsibility and duty of both the Government and unions to ensure that essential public transport operates and that the question of essential services such as trains, aeroplanes and energy supplies, which are, in the final analysis, the responsibility of social partnership, is addressed in a more up front manner by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this relevant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Every dispute that arises is dealt with by the Ministers and the social partners in the best way possible. Thankfully not too many have arisen in terms of the number of sectors of <Col N="1399" /> the economy. Sometimes they are dealt with through the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission, direct talks or the national implementation body. The work is done, by and large behind the scenes, to help to bring the sides together.</P>
      <P>On the recent dispute, to add to what the Minister has said and what has been said outside the House, I deplore the industrial action taking place in CIE. It is manifestly unnecessary and it is causing severe hardship, as Deputy Noonan said. It could easily have been avoided, and almost was avoided last week. When I spoke to the social partners on Thursday about other matters I raised these matters with them on the side and they believed they had been resolved.</P>
      <P>The action is at variance with the commitments to industrial peace and stability in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to which the people involved in this dispute are a party. More significantly, however, it is a flagrant breach of agreed procedures within the trade union movement, as has been pointed out by the Congress of Trade Unions leadership. The orderly conduct of industrial relations is essential to our well-being, quite apart from the implications for the PPF. Without it we would have anarchy and the public and the economy would suffer, ultimately damaging jobs and competitiveness.</P>
      <P>It is a long time since the country was faced with this type of self-destructive inter-union action. There are agreed procedures in these unions and within these companies. Those procedures have existed for a long time. They normally work well. In this case the unions, the Minister and those of us on this side of the House understand them. The Minister outlined the position clearly yesterday and if we do not stick to agreed procedures, we know what will happen but if the Minister takes arbitrary action in this case we also know what will happen. We would end up with a national strike involving all SIPTU workers. They have made that perfectly clear because they would consider that as the Government or the company recognising something that has not been done since the 1946 Industrial Relations Act. The Minister cannot do that. I hope a meeting of the Congress of Trade Unions committee will be held tomorrow to deal with this issue. The Minister and other members of the Government will make every effort to provide assistance. However, we must wait to see what will happen tomorrow. The procedures have been laid down and are clearly understood. In this instance, however, they have been breached by the ATGWU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that avoiding industrial relations chaos is the basis of social partnership. Since the Minister has abandoned all responsibility in dealing with the rail strike, will the Taoiseach indicate what he and the Government intend to do to restore the rail service, to avoid further chaos on the railways <Col N="1400" /> and when they will act, either within the social partnership framework or otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have supported the code of the Congress of Trade Unions for many years and I will continue to do so. I have no intention of breaking principles agreed by the social partners. I will not support the actions of the ATGWU, which are in breach of an agreement between CIE, the Congress of Trade Unions and SIPTU. If I did support those actions, I would damage the social partnership. The ATGWU is wrong in this instance; it is in breach of the congress code, of the understandings reached by the other parties and of the rights of SIPTU. I will not do anything to help the ATGWU, but I will support the Congress of Trade Unions in terms of the position it has adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>One always arrives at a crisis if one's Ministers procrastinate and do not try to resolve matters at an early stage. The Government has reached a crisis and it is its responsibility and that of the social partners to avoid situations such as this. I put it to the Taoiseach that he must do something about this dispute because people cannot get to work or go about their ordinary business. It appears, from what he has already stated, that the Taoiseach is prepared to allow this dispute to continue, in the form of a series of rolling strikes, without any hope of resolution. Does he intend to call a meeting of the social partners to discuss this matter to see if a resolution can be arrived at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated that I met the social partners last Thursday in respect of this matter and, at that stage, they thought they had arrived at a resolution. Tomorrow, a Congress of Trade Unions committee is due to meet to deal primarily with this issue. Like the Minister yesterday, I call today on the ATGWU to call off this destructive action and to resolve the issues in question with the other unions concerned through the agreed procedures that are in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with industrial relations procedures which have been in place for half a century and through which I have no intention of running a coach and four. In this instance, it is clear where the blame lies. The ATGWU made the case that it has a right to deal on behalf of the seven suspended members but that is not the case. SIPTU has the right to deal on behalf of those seven people. When an official of the ATGWU accompanied the workers to a meeting with CIE management aimed at addressing this issue, the management representatives inquired if the ATGWU official was entitled to attend the meeting and were informed that he could do so as a colleague of the seven workers. However, the official in question said he was not there as a colleague but as a member of the ATGWU, knowing it would be impossible for the company to deal with him. The union is wrong, it is in breach of the procedures. SIPTU management cannot <Col N="1401" /> deal with that and the Minister cannot run a coach and four through the agreed procedures. That would not be correct.</P>
    <P>We must try to resolve this issue as best we can under the rules laid down by the Congress of Trade Unions. If suggestions emanate from the Congress of Trade Unions, SIPTU or, for that matter, the ATGWU that would help, the Government will support them. Deputy Noonan must understand that if the Minister breached the procedures and dealt with the ATGWU, there would be a national strike by SIPTU workers. That would be the Government moving away from agreed procedures, which it will not do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>No one is suggesting that. The position the Taoiseach ascribed to us is not correct. It is the responsibility of the Government, the Minister for Public Enterprise in this case, to ensure essential services work. People must get to work and as they must commute, there must be trains. Governments during the years have delegated part of this responsibility to social partnership. If social partnership is not prepared to take it on, it is not working. It seems that social partnership is now beginning to creak, mainly because of neglect by individual Ministers. There are rolling strikes in Aer Lingus which closed the airports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will. There is a series of industrial relations problems across the public service which are tending to undermine social partnership. These include Aer Lingus; the railways; the CPSU, the main Civil Service union which is withdrawing from partnership completely; the nurses who have said that the next time they strike they will withdraw emergency services, and the teachers who are unwilling to settle despite a blatant offer of £40,000 a year made by the Minister for Education and Science at one of their congresses. Social partnership is creaking and frayed around the edges. The Taoiseach is no longer running an Administration which is keeping essential services working. It is his responsibility and that of his Minister and he must give a better answer to the House than the one he has given so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1402" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Social partnership across the affiliated trade unions of congress, the affiliated organisations of IBEC, the farming bodies and all other groups is working extremely well. Their efforts to develop this country are second to none in Europe. I am proud of their actions. This is not a dispute about wages or conditions, but an inter-union dispute about recognition, for which there is a procedure laid down, which has been breached in this case by the ATGWU. There is an agreed written procedure within the CIE company. There is a formula for dealing with the matter through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which has been breached by the ATGWU. A solution must be found, but it cannot be found by the Minister, the Government or CIE throwing aside industrial relations procedures. The Deputy unwisely thinks that it would resolve the dispute, but it would escalate into a national dispute. A solution must be found, but it must be dealt with carefully. The individuals involved thought that they had a solution last week, but that was not the case. It must be dealt with carefully and sensitively and without resorting to off-the-head ideas. The Government will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party is not asking the Taoiseach to drive a coach and four through any procedures or code. However, we want more hands-on management skills and flexibility for which the Taoiseach has built a reputation and which is lacking on the other side of the House. We remain to be convinced that the Taoiseach has a policy in mind other than non-interventionism.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that a coach and four has been driven through the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to increase resources to tackle tax fraud and evasion and ensure tax reductions are delivered in a straightforward, equitable and transparent way as a result of the Revenue Commissioners' tax amnesty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not broaden the scope of his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The question concerns the commitment given under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which will affect social partnership. Will the Taoiseach ensure his intervention is to maintain social partnership rather than undermine it, which it currently will do? At the next meeting, when the Taoiseach comes to deal with issues such as waste management and housing, he should attempt to bring in the social partners to find a more radical solution to those problems, given the failure of current policies. Given the international experience, the social partners could be brought on board in the area of the zero waste strategy. The possibility of a constitutional referendum to reduce the absolute rights of private property so that the rented sector might provide more of the solution to the <Col N="1403" /> housing crisis could also be put to the social partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the efforts of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to resolve the issue. It has been very clear that the ATGWU is at fault in this matter in renewing a dispute that caused great hardship last summer, and which the Labour Court pointed out could only be addressed by an orderly agreement. If there was goodwill this dispute could be resolved in one hour by the individuals involved. I understand that a basis for resolution was almost agreed last week. The Minister met the social partners last week and I also had a meeting with them. The problem was believed to have been resolved at that stage. Representatives of congress and some of the affiliate unions were at that meeting.</P>
      <P>I call again on the ATGWU to call off what is destructive action, and to resolve the issues with the other unions concerned through agreed procedures. That is the only way to succeed and the way is open for the ATGWU to do this. If there is help the Government can give, it will do it, but will be careful not to make the situation worse. The action is damaging not only to the travelling public but to the public transport system. I know Deputy Sargent is a supporter of the current investment in the system. It has been argued that there was under-investment in the past but that is no longer the case. It is unfortunate at such a time of investment that a union gets involved in this type of recognition dispute, but this is also damaging to the trade union movement itself. I do not want to see that movement damaged as I have a great regard for it.</P>
      <P>Proper trade unionism can be effective in safeguarding the interests of members only when it is seen to be rational and responsible. In this case it is not. This is irresponsible action which has weakened trade unionism as a social partner and as a key influence on social and economic development. However, trade unions cannot be forced to do things. We do not live in a totalitarian, non-union State. I agree with Deputies Noonan and Sargent concerning Government assistance. The Government will do everything it can to help. This dispute should not have begun and what we can do to bring it to a close, we will. The Minister for Public Enterprise stands ready to act immediately.</P>
      <P>On the issue of social partnership, the commitments on pay, tax and environmental matters continue. Deputies will see in the progress report the amount of progress that has taken place in those areas. Some of these issues were discussed in the House yesterday. The Government and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government are committed to seeing these policies through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What action have the Taoiseach, the Cabinet, and specifically the Minister for Public Enterprise, taken since last summer when this dispute first manifested itself? Does the Taoiseach accept that there is a direct responsibility on the Government, on the Taoiseach as the leader of that Government, and on the line Minister, in this instance Deputy O'Rourke, to take decisive action to ensure that CIE is adequately resourced to deal with issues that have come to the surface once again? They could have been predicted to surface over the past year. What direct action has the Taoiseach taken through the social partnership mechanism to ensure the Government, as the stakeholder acting on behalf of citizens, has ensured CIE is properly equipped to resolve this dispute and the other problems associated with the poor management of CIE over many years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Numerous developments have occurred, not least of which is the rail investment programme. Fundamental changes occurred in the operations of Dublin Bus following the successful resolution last year of difficulties in the company. I commend the company on its positive developments during the past year. The rail safety programme was introduced and new plans have been drawn up on CIE's future operations. The Minister has successfully negotiated additional resources for the company and this has been widely welcomed by all of the unions. A number of industrial relations issues have arisen in the company as there are a number of staff grades and unions involved. Deputy Quinn will be aware that the three wise men have almost completed their report on CIE in which these issues are addressed.</P>
      <P>The current dispute is a separate issue. It was not foreseen that members of ILDA, who created such difficulties last year, would move into the ATGWU. That fact, which has arisen only in the past two months, was not anticipated by ICTU, SIPTU, the company or the Minister. This issue must be addressed through a mechanism agreed by all parties. It would be catastrophic for CIE for the Minister to attempt to intervene in this dispute without taking into account the overall picture. We must be very careful about how we resolve this matter.</P>

        <b>:</b> The Taoiseach stated, in reply to Deputy Sargent, that this dispute should never have arisen. Is he aware that during the debate on a Private Notice Question to the Minister on this issue yesterday, I brought a letter from the ATGWU, dated 19 April, to the Minister's attention? The letter outlined in considerable detail the grievances which remained unresolved in spite of the promises made to the union last August if it called off the strike. The Minister for Public Enterprise stated that she had not even acknowledged the letter, let alone addressed the fundamental issues raised. She further stated that she referred the letter to the Taoiseach's Depart<Col N="1405" /> ment. What did the Taoiseach do with the letter? Was any action taken on foot of the letter or was it simply buried? Is that the real reason we now face a massive industrial relations problem in CIE for the second day in succession, a problem which effectively closed down the east of the country yesterday, the south today and which will close down the west tomorrow? </P>

        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> Does the Taoiseach agree that if he were the captain of a ship which ran into a storm, it would, instead of quoting drily from a manual, be preferable to look out to sea, elicit from where the waves were coming and decide on a course of emergency action? The Taoiseach was asked about the letter sent to the Minister for Public Enterprise regarding the issues at the heart of the rail dispute. Is he aware that a significant section of the locomotive drivers allege they are being mistreated, isolated and victimised by Iarnród Éireann management which has, on 56 separate occasions, refused to go to the Labour Relations Commission to deal with individual grievances?</P>
      <P>What does that say about the spirit of social partnership within Iarnród Éireann? Will the Taoiseach agree it makes a mockery of social partnership when a State company refuses to deal harmoniously with a significant section of its locomotive drivers? Will he call on the management of Iarnród Éireann to enter into dialogue with its workers to try to overcome the current problems and ensure a proper public transport system is kept continually on the rails?</P>

    <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it is now abundantly clear that &ldquo;social partnership&rdquo; is but fancy words for a system which seeks to keep wage increases for workers to a minimum while placing no such limits on profits, rent and speculation? Why would low paid civil servants continue to have any allegiance to social partnership when their wages are hammered to minimum and they are being robbed by rack-renting landlords in the <Col N="1406" /> major cities in which they live? They are faced with continued increases in house prices, an issue with which the Taoiseach has failed to deal.</P>

      <P>If I was confronted by a storm while out at sea, I would follow procedures. I would not paddle my own canoe and ignore safety procedures.</P>
      <P>The PPF was negotiated with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. I am not sure if Deputy Joe Higgins is suggesting that the company should just ignore written procedures negotiated and agreed under the banner of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions with an affiliate union. The union involved in this case is SIPTU but it could have been any other union. It could have been the ATGWU and another company. Rules governing the rights of organised workers were laid down in law in 1906. They were amended in 1941, 1946, 1990 and 1998. The ATGWU is in breach of those rules. It is ignoring the guidelines of its own organisation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Its leader is a member of the executive of that organisation and would be the first to shout &ldquo;foul&rdquo; if somebody else did what has been done here. We are trying to follow the rules. We either have rules or we do not. As long as rules exist, the Government will honour them.</P>
      <P>We negotiated the PPF with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions; we will adhere to those rules and when ICTU decides it no longer wishes to have rules we will do something else. As of now, rules and regulations exist. They may be a little inconvenient at times, there is no doubt about that, but they have been used to structure organised labour in a proper manner. I thought the Deputy would like that. We are following that line.</P>
      <P>I refute what the Deputy had to say about social partnership. It has enabled us to give employment to another 750,000 people. We are no longer facing the bad times of the 1980s when we had high emigration, high unemployment, industrial unrest, anarchy and a lack of investment and hope in our country. We will not go back to those times. We must deal with this dispute in a sane, sensible manner. This matter could be sorted out, under the rules, in an hour. We will not break the rules.</P>

      <P>After those enticing images of the Taoiseach as a seafarer, can we get back to the railways? The ports are still open and ships are sailing, but the trains are not running. The Taoiseach seemed to imply that Members on this side of the House are advocating that a coach and four be driven through industrial relations procedures. We are not suggesting that at all. There are no coaches on the railways in Munster today and there was none on the east coast yesterday.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, who is ready to interfere in the affairs of State companies regarding trivial matters, has refused for some months to deal with this crisis? When she was put on notice of the issues in a letter dated 19 April she did not act and gave the Taoiseach the hospital pass. However, the issue does not seem to have been dealt with in the Taoiseach's Department either.</P>
      <P>The reason there were no trains in the east yesterday, that there are none in Munster today and that there will be none in the west tomorrow is that no one dealt with this problem when it was crystal clear it was going to end up as it has done. This has been clear for several months.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that a hallmark of the manner in which his Ministers behave is that they deal with crises as if they had suddenly stepped on a rake and say, &ldquo;Oh, what happened,&rdquo; while everyone else knows the issue has been a matter of concern for months.</P>

      <P>Needless to say, I reject that nonsense as that is not the case. It would be easy for a Government which did not care about social partnership, procedures or negotiated collective agreements to just throw down the cards one way or the other. That is not the position. The position is that a union which was not recognised fought a long dispute, did not get its way and did not resolve the issue because it could not be dealt with due to the collective procedures within the union. It then tried a different approach and is getting the same answer.</P>
      <P>There is a process which can resolve this issue which has to be followed. There is no quick fix or easy way around this. That would be the wrong thing to do. Industrial relations is a delicate, tricky issue. It would be lovely if it could all be sorted out in Question Time. If that was the case it would have been sorted out decades ago. However, that is not how it works.</P>
      <P>It works out based on negotiated agreements, clear understandings of who negotiates for whom, who has the right to speak for whom and who represents whom. These agreements have taken a long time and much hard work to reach, and I agree with them. Regardless of the pain, we have to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue can be resolved. It is wrong that the public is suffering today, that it suffered yesterday and that it will suffer tomorrow, by the way things are going. However, this issue has to be resolved by organised workers under the rules of ICTU. <Col N="1408" /> That is what has to happen. The Government and the Minister will do whatever they can.</P>

      <P>It is most important with regard to competitiveness, the tourism industry and the travelling public. However, a resolution will not be achieved with a magic wand and there is no quick fix. It must be resolved within the procedures. That may be the bad news, but that is the position. Last week the Government thought the matter had been resolved and that there was a clear understanding between the two unions involved, SIPTU and the ATGWU, under the umbrella of congress. However, that did not work for the various reasons outlined by the Minister yesterday. That aspect must be brought back into play; there is no other way of resolving the matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding who is in charge, the Minister, CIE management, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the unions involved have a role to play. If there was agreement, some of the State's industrial mechanisms would be available. However, that is unlikely in the absence of agreement. That avenue will be pursued at the meeting tomorrow.</P>

      <P>The dispute has the appearance of an opening festering wound. Will the matter be on the agenda when the social partners meet to discuss rural transport? Has the Taoiseach learned any lessons in terms of a framework for the provision of acceptable rural transportation? Has the dispute coloured his judgment in relation to public transport and how it should be provided in the future given that it appears the dispute is focused on claims about a lack of representation for the workers involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view of the Combat Poverty Agency is that the partnership approach largely ignores the needs of those who are unable to work. Has that view coloured the Taoiseach's judgment regarding the failure of partnership and the fact that it needs to be radically altered to ensure that people who are unable to work are included and represented by the mechanisms? The dispute appears to be focused on people who do not consider that they are represented, but they have muscle to do something about it, which has created chaos. What is the position regarding people who are unable to work and do not have <Col N="1410" /> any industrial muscle? Is the Taoiseach prepared to alter the mechanisms so they feel represented?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be possible if we could find a way of doing it without upsetting the traditional structures. However, there must be some movement. Regarding rural transport, additional resources have been provided under a number of headings in the national development plan. County development boards have already started their surveys and a number of lines that were closed will be reopened. Lines that have been under-utilised are to be improved. A number of lines, including in north Cork and Sligo, require considerable extra resources.</P>
      <P>On the question of rural transport, feasibility studies have started with the county board structures, the Department and the transport agencies to devise new plans for what are, perhaps, old ways. Resources have been allocated for this purpose under the national development plan. The Government would be very supportive of them because they will be very beneficial in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government welcomes any independent analysis of Ireland's human rights policies, domestic and international. There are many issues highlighted within Amnesty International's audit of Ireland's compliance with international human rights standards with which we agree and I would be happy to provide a list of these to the Deputy. NGOs are important partners for the Department of Foreign Affairs in the examination of human rights issues on which I would welcome any contribution to a constructive dialogue.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Cowen, strongly rejects, however, the claim in the report that Ireland failed in its chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to deal adequately with the crisis in Chechnya, the dominant political issue during our chairmanship. It received the constant personal attention of the former Minister, Deputy Andrews, and the Minister. The Council of Europe is now playing a significant role in Chechnya, including by maintaining human rights experts on the ground to register and follow-up on human rights violations. This role was initiated under Ireland's presidency. Our role was acknowledged at the time and subsequently, including by the Council's Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Alvaro Gil-Robles. In an interview with <i>The Irish Times</i> on 26 March the Commissioner said that &ldquo;it was in large measure due to Ireland's interest that so much has been achieved.&rdquo;  In a statement issued following publication of the Amnesty International report, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Mr. Walter Schwimmer, expressed surprise at the criticism of Irish involvement with the Chechnya conflict in the report and said: &ldquo;Ireland made a significant impact on these issues during its term in office and to now accuse it of failing to take action is, in my view, mistaken and misdirected.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period of Ireland's chairmanship of the Council, the Parliamentary Assembly decided to withdraw the voting rights of the Russian members of the assembly. This sent a clear signal to Russia that the Council of Europe would not be prepared to tolerate violation by Russia of its commitments as a member of the organisation. Unlike the Parliamentary Assembly, however, the Committee of Ministers acts on the basis of consensus of its members. Ireland's approach as chairman of the committee was to maintain maximum pressure for fulfilment by Russia of its obligations to the Council and, at the same time, ensure a meaningful response by the Council of Europe, including a concrete contribution on the ground to protecting the human rights of individual Chechnyans. Ireland's view was, and remains, <Col N="1412" /> that the Council could not make that contribution unless Russia remained a member of the organisation. No member state supported the suspension of Russia from the Council.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>Ireland used its chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers to highlight the concerns of the international community over Chechnya; to maintain effective political pressure on Russia to fulfil its obligation; and to provide concrete assistance for the victims of the terrible human rights violations on the ground. Today, the Council is making that contribution, notably by maintaining its experts on the ground pursuing reported cases of human rights violations. The Council remains the only international organisation present in Chechnya.</P>
    <P>While there have been in the period since our presidency some positive developments in Chechnya, the Government continues to have serious concerns over the situation there. These concerns were echoed in the resolution recently adopted by the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. Ireland continues to be actively involved in pressing Russia to fulfil its commitments, including those secured during our Council of Europe chairmanship.</P>

      <P>I regret the absence of the Minister and hope he is recovering from his accident. We send him our good wishes. Does the Minister of State accept that Amnesty International is a recognised international body with a fine reputation? How is it that those aspects of the report the Government considered complimentary were welcomed while it rejected the report's cutting criticism of its record during its presidency of the Council of Europe? Does the Minister of State agree that there is a factual basis for the accusation that the Government failed to use its position during its presidency to take effective action against the Russian Federation during the Chechen war? Under the Irish presidency, the Committee of Ministers failed to take any action against the Russian Federation, a member of the Council of Europe. Does the Minister of State agree that it is a fair and independent criticism? How does Ireland intend to do better in future in view of its dismal record on the issue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that Amnesty International is a credible organisation with which we work closely together with NGOs in evaluating Ireland's compliance with its international human rights obligations. However, with regard to our role during our presidency of the Committee of Ministers, it is factually incorrect to state that Ireland failed to take action. When Ireland took over the presidency it quickly became clear that the situation in Chechnya was deteriorating rapidly. At our insistence, Chechnya was included in the formal agenda of every meeting of the Committee of Ministers, that is, every week, during <Col N="1413" /> our presidency despite the strong opposition of the Russian Federation.</P>
      <P>As the Chechen crisis deepened during the first months of our presidency, we were convinced, as were other members, that no useful purpose could be served by suspending Russia's membership of the Council of Europe. No other member state supported suspension or expulsion of Russia. On taking office as chairman of the Committee of Ministers, the then Minister, Deputy Andrews, instructed that every effort should be directed to dealing with the issue, an instruction which continued when Deputy Cowen succeeded him. This resulted in intensive discussion of Chechnya at every meeting of the Committee of Ministers during our chairmanship. It also resulted in the visit of the Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Gil-Robles, to the region, sustained political pressure on Russia to respond to deepening concerns about the situation, a decision to place Council of Europe human rights experts on the ground in Chechnya &ndash; they are still there &ndash; and a commitment by the Russian Foreign Minister, in a ministerial level communiqué, to the establishment of independent investigation of human rights violations.</P>

      <P>Ireland will hold the presidency of the United Nations Security Council for the month of October 2001. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, has identified the key priorities for our presidency as being to manage the business of the Council effectively for the month and to ensure it reacts speedily to crisis situations as and when they arise. In preparing for the presidency, the Minister will give careful consideration to how best Ireland's distinctive UN experience and approach can contribute to actively taking forward the Security Council's agenda during the month.</P>
      <P>Due to the rapidly changing nature of the international agenda, it is difficult to identify at this point the particular issues which will engage the Council in October this year. Ireland's experience during the past four months on the Security Council has been positive. We have engaged actively in all aspects of the Council's work, particularly in key areas such as the Middle East, Angola, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Great Lakes, the Balkans and East Timor, as well as on the important issue of strengthening co-operation between the Security Council and countries which contribute to peacekeeping operations. The Minister intends that this level of commitment will be carried through during our full term on the Council and the presidency in October.</P>
      <P>The role of the presidency of the Security Council is governed by the Council's rules of procedure and relatively formalised. One of Ireland's main tasks in the presidency will be to convene and chair the meetings of the Council and draw up a work programme at the beginning of the month, in consultation with all other Security Council members and the UN secretariat.</P>
      <P>I will now turn to the other element of the Deputy's question. While the United Nations Security Council has specific responsibilities for the maintenance of peace and international security, the issue of expenditure on arms, as in the terms described by the Deputy, is not directly addressed by the Council. However, UN Security Council and EU sanctions are in place with the specific aim of reducing the flow of arms to a number of conflict areas.</P>
      <P>There is, unfortunately, also illicit trafficking in arms which is often linked to illegal trade in high value commodities such as so-called blood diamonds and other natural resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>This link often leads to the exacerbation of conflicts, particularly in Africa. Both aspects of the problem are being addressed. The UN conference on the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons in all its aspects will take place in New York next July with the objective of agreeing an international action plan to combat this <Col N="1415" /> illicit trafficking. The Irish delegation is fully engaged in the preparatory work. The trade in high value natural resources and commodities is also being addressed, especially in areas which suffer from persistent conflict such as Angola and Sierra Leone.</P>
    <P>In the case of Angola, Ireland, as a member of the United Nations Security Council, is playing an active role through its chairmanship of the United Nations sanctions committee against UNITA, Angola. The sanctions have an important role to play in bringing the tragic conflict in Angola to an end and we are determined to ensure they are fully implemented. So far as Sierra Leone and Liberia are concerned, Ireland, as vice-chair of the Liberia sanctions committee, is also playing an active role. Security Council sanctions against Liberia came into effect on Monday, 7 May, and we will work to help ensure their full implementation and effectiveness.</P>
    <P>In all our efforts on these important issues we remain conscious of the commitment made by the leaders of all UN member states on the occasion of the millennium summit in New York last September. The declaration which they made, <i>inter alia,</i> addressed the inter-related issues of development, peace, security and disarmament, and, specifically, the need to implement treaties in arms control and disarmament, to strive for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and to end illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons.</P>
    <P>In compliance with these undertakings, the United Nations Secretary General is preparing a progress report on implementation for consideration at the next regular session of the General Assembly.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs a speedy recovery. The Minister of State gave a most pedestrian answer to the second part of my priority question. Having canvassed the world for membership of the Security Council, to then say that we hope to manage well when the month's presidency arises is something I have only heard in organisations I will not insult by naming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been given an answer that I cannot accept to the first part of my question. Is the Minister of State aware that the United Nations figures for arms production in 1999 were $886 billion while expenditure on preventable diseases was $15 billion and the totality of health expenditure through the WHO was $65 billion? These are United Nations figures provided by United Nations agencies. Does Ireland propose to take an initiative at the Security Council with regard to the disgraceful production of armaments, deflection of resources and distribution and sale of armaments? The illicit arms the Minister of State mentioned began their existence as legal armaments. Will we take any initiative in this area, or will we tell the people interested in this <Col N="1416" /> issue that we are just concentrating on managing other countries' agendas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to whether we will make reduction of expenditure on armaments a priority of our presidency of the Security Council, the Minister will examine nearer the time how best Ireland's distinctive experience and approach can contribute to taking forward the items on the agenda of the Security Council during our presidency in October. While the question of armaments is not on the agenda of the Security Council, we are committed to pursuing this matter in the context of ongoing discussions on specific situations.</P>
      <P>One of the main aims of the Security Council's sanctions regime is to prevent a build up of arms by the countries or organisations against which the sanctions are directed. The main fora for the consideration of disarmament and non-proliferation matters in the UN system, in addition to the sanctions and arms embargoes imposed by the Security Council, are the General Assembly, the UN disarmament commission, the UN conference on disarmament based in Geneva &ndash; to which Ireland was admitted two years ago &ndash; and UN convened conferences on specific subjects. The General Assembly also considers the outcome of review conferences and other treaties and conventions, such as the non-proliferation treaty and the comprehensive test ban treaty.</P>
      <P>We will not, simply, concentrate on pedestrian matters. The Minister and the Government will decide when Ireland assumes the presidency. It will depend on what is happening in the world at the time. One cannot say in May what critical item will be on the agenda in October. That will be for the Minister to decide at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to reduce foreign policy on disarmament to something like weather forecasting. One does not know if it will be raining in October either. I am aware of what the United Nations institutions do. Disarmament relates to countries which already have armaments. If the Minister of State cannot say what will happen in the Security Council, what other initiatives will the Minister take to achieve a reduction in the disgraceful amount of money being spent on armaments? The disarmament bodies are concerned only with reducing countries' armaments.</P>

      <P>With a number of like-minded Foreign Ministers, the Minister and his predecessor engaged in developing strategies for the pursuit of human security. This concept of security is people centred rather than state centred, an approach that is useful and necessary when dealing with the proliferation of small arms, the effects of which are felt most directly in civilian life. Under the Irish chairmanship in 1999, guidelines on practical measures to remove small arms and light weapons from circulation in post-conflict situations were adopted by the UN disarmament commission. Our activities are focused on <Col N="1417" /> the forthcoming small arms conference to be held in 2001.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether there is now a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and in which hundreds of thousands of the Afghan people are suffering; and the humanitarian and political steps which can be taken directly through the European Union or the United Nations Security Council to assist the Afghan people.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The continuation of the conflict in Afghanistan, aggravated by the recent resumption of a spring offensive, renders the overall situation, especially in terms of humanitarian needs, even more serious and pressing than before. The Afghan people continue to remain the single largest refugee caseload in the world. Approximately 1.2 million Afghan refugees are in Pakistan and 1.4 million in Iran, while about one million people have been displaced inside Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>More than 20 years of conflict has ruined the economy and reduced the living conditions of most of Afghanistan's 20 million population to a bare subsistence level. The United Nations system recently estimated that about 500,000 Afghans have left their homes since last year due to drought, conflict, or a combination of both, while nearly three million Afghans are now dependent on food aid for survival.</P>
      <P>Efforts to achieve a peace settlement between the warring parties have centred on the six-plus-two group, made up of the six neighbouring countries along with Russia and the United States. The UN Secretary General has sent a special representative, Mr. Vendrell, to Kabul to move this process forward. However, peace talks are not yet in prospect and the effects of the conflict continue to have serious repercussions, not only within Afghanistan but in adjoining countries. This has led to a situation where neighbouring countries are no longer prepared to host any more refugees. This situation, which is a reality constraining the efforts of the international community to achieve the desired humanitarian and political solutions, is of the greatest concern to the Irish Government.</P>
      <P>Only a sustained international effort in support of the affected populations can avert further suffering and loss of life. It is in this context that Ireland has been working at the UN, and especially at the Security Council, to alleviate these problems. The Government continues to highlight the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and to stress the need to take it fully into account in the context of UN Security Council considerations of this subject.</P>
      <P>I recently announced an aid package of emergency assistance totalling £953,000 to address the effects of drought, crop failure, conflict and displacement, which have devastated the lives of millions of Afghans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" />
      <i>Additional Information</i>This includes allocations to the Irish non-governmental organisations Concern and Christian Aid for projects providing emergency assistance to the most vulnerable among those affected by drought. Some £750,000 was granted to the UN agencies, the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organisation and UNICEF through the UN consolidated appeal for Afghanistan and is being directed at the areas of greatest need, such as food assistance, food security and emergency health activities. This significant contribution is part of a determined effort by Ireland Aid to be more pro-active in responding to emergencies while at the same time enabling more timely emergency interventions in the field.</P>
    <P>The European Union is the principal donor for the provision of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. In the period 1991 to 2001, approximately 400 million has been committed by the European Commission for programmes focusing on emergency aid to refugees, returnees and internally displaced people.</P>
    <P>The Government, along with its European Union colleagues, continues to raise the need to improve the conditions of the general population of Afghanistan. We have stressed the importance of finding a long-term, comprehensive solution which addresses the political difficulties, the issues of terrorism and drugs, as well as the humanitarian situation. We are continuing to keep the situation under close review.</P>

      <P>Since I tabled this question, the programme made by Mark Little has been shown on RTE and demonstrates that in my question I underestimated the extent of the problem and the horrific catastrophe occurring in Afghanistan. Does the Minister of State believe we are doing enough to assist the Afghan people? Almost 20% of the population are refugees or displaced which amounts to more than 3.5 million people. We have given about £900,000 in cash, which works out at about 33p or 34p per head, as our contribution towards the alleviation of the problem. Does the Minister of State agree that this is perhaps one of the greatest catastrophes since the Ethiopian crisis? Does she also agree that much more needs to be done directly at this stage by way of aid and support through the European Union by putting together a major package from the Union and from the UN? Not enough is being done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> On a political level, we have taken action through our membership of the Security Council to highlight the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. We have been outspoken on the need to take the humanitarian impact of the UN sanctions on the Afghan people into account. Ireland is one of the few countries which pushed for a briefing of the Security Council by the UN office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs on the impact of the sanctions. We also called for measures to ensure the greatest number of humanitarian organisations possible had full exemptions from the flight ban imposed by the UN sanctions against the Taliban. We have also been outspoken on the issue of human rights violations in Afghanistan, especially discrimination against women.</P>

      <P>Are the people who are not classified as refugees the worst-off? It was clear from the RTE programme that huge numbers of people have been displaced who, for political reasons, cannot be registered and recognised as refugees and who do not receive any assistance.

      <P>There is not any discrimination in terms of the receipt of humanitarian assistance.

This is a massive appeal by the international community because the position has deteriorated in the past few months. Every effort will be made. Ireland is cognisant of the need for further humanitarian assistance and we will be forthcoming in that regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Embassy in Prague and the Department of Foreign Affairs are giving every appropriate assistance to the family during this most traumatic time. The family are naturally anxious to know as soon as possible the cause of death and the outcome of the Czech police investigation of the matter. The Embassy has been in regular contact with the police since 23 April and believes that a thorough investigation is being carried out. The police informed the Embassy on 30 April that two women had been charged with robbery and may face further charges when the results of <Col N="1420" /> the autopsy carried out in Prague, which are expected shortly, are known.</P>
    <P>We will continue to liaise closely with the Czech authorities and keep the family fully informed of developments. The family have asked for privacy at this sad time and we want to respect their wishes in this regard in so far as we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister of State, I express my sympathy to the family of the young man who died in Prague and to the family of the young man who nearly died but, thankfully, survived. Many people are concerned for young Irish people now that they can travel abroad so freely. What action has the Government taken to express its concern and annoyance to the Czech authorities about what appeared to be the dilatory manner in which the first report to the police in Prague was made? The police more or less ignored the request of Irish people there to investigate the death of one young Irishman and the near death of another. What annoyance has been expressed to the police, now that it has taken the matter seriously and arrested two people? Does the Minister of State agree that the delay by the Prague police led to a great deal of extra stress and pain for the family of the young man who lost his life?</P>

      <P>I know there were such concerns initially but we are satisfied that the Czech police are investigating all possibilities. The Embassy is in constant contact with the Czech authorities and will continue to monitor the situation until the matter is resolved. The Department advises people who seek its advice about travelling to Prague to be aware of the need for vigilance in places of public entertainment. This also applies to many other countries. We have been in constant discussions with the Czech authorities who regret the incident and have co-operated with the Irish authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on 21 September 1992. In accordance with Article 44 of the convention, Ireland is required to present reports to the committee on the rights of the child every five years. These reports must set out details of the protection afforded under Irish law to the rights guaranteed in the convention and detail how fully its provisions are being implemented. Ireland submitted its first national report to the committee in April 1996. That report was considered by the committee in Geneva on 12 and 13 January 1998 and I led the national delegation on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the publication in November 2000 of Ireland's first ever national children's strategy. The strategy provides a co-ordinating framework for the future development of children's policy and services delivery, and identifies clear goals and objectives to be achieved for children over the next ten years. While Ireland's second report to the committee was due on 27 October 1999, it was felt that as work was under way in relation to the preparation of the national children's strategy, submission should await its publication, so that the latest developments could be reflected in the report. Such suggestions can be accommodated within the UN reporting system which has difficulty, due to pressure on resources in examining reports by the due date. The recently established national children's office, which was proposed in the strategy, will be responsible for the drafting of Ireland's second report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication of the strategy represents substantial progress since Ireland last reported to the UN committee. The strategy addresses a number of the principal concerns expressed by the committee on the rights of the child in its concluding observations on Ireland's first report, including the suggestion that Ireland adopt a comprehensive national policy on children. Some of the key measures contained in the strategy which address concerns expressed by the UN committee <Col N="1422" /> include: the proposal to establish an office of Ombudsman for children, for which legislation will be brought forward shortly; measures to give children a voice and support their participation; research and information proposals to improve our knowledge about children's lives; new structures to promote better co-ordination and integration in areas which cut across departmental boundaries and to maximise collaboration between Departments, statutory and voluntary agencies and the research community and the elimination of child poverty as a strategy objective.</P>
    <P>Tangible opportunities, focused research and specific objectives are being set to meet these goals within the time frame of the strategy.</P>
    <P>Another concern voiced by the committee related to the area of juvenile justice. In response to some queries on the age of criminal responsibility, the Children Bill, 1999, which has completed Committee Stage in the Dáil and now awaits Report Stage, has been amended to raise the minimum age from ten to 12 years.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to see through all its commitments in relation to the rights of the child both within the framework of the strategy and by means of any necessary additional measures.</P>

I have the minutes of the session in Geneva in January 1998 at which the Minister got quite a roasting. Were she to go back now, in view of the lack of progress she has reported in many areas, she would get another roasting. Is this not the reason for the delay of more than 18 months in presenting the report?</P>
      <P>I initiated legislation for the appointment of an Ombudsman for children in 1996 but it is still not on the Statute Book. What has become of mandatory reporting, which I opposed but which the Minister of State supported at the hearing in Geneva? Where is the amendment to the Constitution which was promised by the Minister of State? She said the Government intended to &ldquo;honour the commitment for an amendment of the Constitution to underpin the rights of the child&rdquo;. I quote directly from the Minister of State. What progress has been made in relation to the constitutional amendment? Is this another reason the Minister of State does not wish to go back to Geneva? Promises were made in relation to the Hague convention on inter-country adoptions. We were told a Bill to deal with that matter would be a priority for the child care policy unit. What is the progress in relation to that? When will the Minister of State ensure that sufficient progress has been made to honour our commitments so that she can go back to Geneva without fear of getting an even greater roasting than last time?</P>

    <P>To maximise public awareness of the treaty, the Government has also arranged to have the summary of the White Paper distributed to every household in the country. The delivery to close to 1.3 million households should by now be well advanced. The summary also includes contact details for obtaining copies of the full White Paper.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Referendum Commission, which operates independently of Government, will distribute information, in line with its mandate, in respect of the proposed referendum.</P>
    <P>In short, every effort is being made to assist the public to make an informed choice when voting in the forthcoming referendum.</P>
    <P>The Government is strongly in favour of ratification of the Treaty of Nice, a position shared, I am glad to say, by the two major Opposition parties. The Government will seek the strongest possible endorsement of the treaty in recognition of the importance of the European Union for Ireland and for the countries engaged in accession negotiations.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister of State agree there are two divergent opinions of the Nice Treaty? Does she agree that it is unfair that the Government side, in the White Paper, has been distributed to every home in the country while no such provision has been made for those who disagree with what the Government is saying and who believe the Government is being disingenuous in some of its claims as to what the treaty does and does not stand for?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that it is disingenuous of Government spokespeople to state that the Nice Treaty will benefit the 150 million people of central and eastern Europe? What studies have been done on the effect of joining the EU on the two million Polish farmers or on what would happen to State subsidies&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Referendum Commission will devise its own strategy for informing the Irish public. It is true that the White Paper has been distributed and the treaty itself is available to the public but the Referendum Commission, which is independent of Government, will be in a position to lay out the arguments for and against ratification of the treaty. That is quite proper.</P>

      <Col N="1425" /> There is an entitlement to public rational debate on this issue. The Taoiseach has stressed the need for debate on the real issues. People should be asked to vote on the basis of realistic information and not hysterical rhetoric. The accession countries are in favour of joining an enlarged Union. I do not see how it is practicable for opponents of the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote here to try to second guess what is good for the accession countries. They are to the fore and are pressing the agenda. They are anxious to join the European Union and we are anxious to join with them.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister concerned about the dangers of a low turnout for the referenda? Is there not a danger that this referendum in particular could be lost due to apathy? Has the Government any programme in place to encourage a major turn out on 7 June, particularly for the referendum on the Nice Treaty? </P>

        <b>:</b> Would the Minister agree the Government is saying that joining the EU will be of great benefit to the peoples of central and eastern Europe? On what study is the fate of the ordinary people in those countries based? The elite are in favour of joining the EU because they want to get their snouts into the trough along with everybody else.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree it is disingenuous for the Government to say that the Nice Treaty has nothing to do with militarisation when it consolidates the procedures put in place in the Amsterdam Treaty leading to the so-called rapid reaction force which in reality is an EU army? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Deputy O'Keeffe's question about a low turn out, the Government <Col N="1426" /> is anxious that people should come out and articulate positive support for the European ideal. It is an ideal opportunity for the people to endorse the European project, yet again. They have to do this, however, on the basis of clear information and we fully intend to get that information across to them. These are complex issues and it is difficult to deal with the technical aspects of the treaty in a rational way. Today, the Government launched its campaign and we hope to have a reasoned and fair-minded debate on the issues.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins asked how we knew the accession countries wanted to join the European Union. The accession countries have been involved in the most detailed accession negotiations with the European Commission over several years. They all realise they have everything to gain by joining the Union and that enlargement will be to their benefit, as it will be for the existing member states.</P>
      <P>The treaty makes only limited changes to the existing provisions of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, as agreed at Amsterdam. Contrary to the impression that has been conveyed in some quarters, the development of the EU Security and Defence Policy is based on the provision of the Amsterdam Treaty. In other words, it has already been agreed by the people. It does not affect Ireland's policy of military neutrality. Our participation is only to be in any crisis management mission and that remains to be decided by sovereign decision of the Government, subject to Oireachtas approval on a case by case basis. Moreover, we will only take part in missions authorised by the United Nations. This is clear and unambiguous. The issues at stake are, clearly, important, not just for the accession countries but for Ireland. Ireland, which has gained so much from its membership of the European Union should be the loudest voice in favour and since we are the only country to have a referendum ours should be the loudest voice by the people coming out in large numbers to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned at the reports of continuing tensions and violations of human rights in West Papua, or Irian Jaya as it has been known since 1973. Our concerns on the current situation are shared fully by our EU partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The territory became the 26th province of Indonesia in 1969 after a consultative process known as the &ldquo;Act of Free Choice&rdquo;, which was sponsored by the United Nations and which fol<Col N="1427" /> lowed the earlier transfer, in 1962, of administrative authority from the Netherlands to Indonesia. The United Nations General Assembly, in 1969, accepted the Secretary General's report on the fulfilment of his mandate, although it is clear there was some disquiet at that time about the circumstances in which the Act of Free Choice was carried out.</P>
    <P>Since 1969, the indigenous population, who are of the same ethnic origin as those in the eastern half of the island of New Guinea, have suffered the twin effects of economic exploitation and Indonesia's transmigration programme. The Government-sponsored programme for migrants from Java and Sulawesi &ndash; comprising more than 10,000 families every year &ndash; could result in the indigenous West Papuan population being reduced to a minority. The widespread appropriation of land for new settlements, forestry concessions, mining projects and farming has led to numerous large scale conflicts between the Indonesian military and the dispossessed tribes people.</P>
    <P>As regards the suggestion that the United Nations should now review its own role in the decolonisation process, such a review of decisions by the United Nations would not only be unprecedented but would also have wide-ranging implications, including for other areas of UN activity. However, even if the grounds for such a review were to be satisfactorily established I do not see any prospect of a mandate for it being agreed by the broad UN membership.</P>
    <P>The approach supported by the Government, as well as by the EU, is to promote greater decentralisation and autonomy based on dialogue and negotiations between local authorities and the authorities in Jakarta. However, if this approach is to be successful it will need goodwill and a constructive attitude on both sides.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, it requires that the Indonesian authorities exercise full and proper control over the security forces to ensure that human rights violations of which they are accused are investigated and the perpetrators prosecuted, and, above all, that such abuses be brought to an end. It also requires that the Indonesian authorities seriously engage with representatives of the local population and not place unnecessary and wilful impediments in their way.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>On the other hand, it requires that the local population build up their capacity to enter into this process in a meaningful and, I hope, agreed way. In this context, I have invited a human rights representative for Irian Jaya to provide us with suggestions about how we could be of assistance in providing training. However, I am concerned at reports of divisions in the local population involving elements ready to use violence to prevent dialogue taking place.</P>
    <P>The situation in Irian Jaya must also be viewed against the background of the current serious pol<Col N="1428" /> itical and economic problems throughout Indonesia. I am not confident the authorities in Jakarta will either be able or willing to take the decisions necessary for decentralisation and increased regional autonomy. Together with our EU partners, we are following these developments very closely and with great concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government made any representation about those to whom reference was made at the Committee on Foreign Affairs and who are being held in prison in Jakarta? What results have there been following the Government's inquiries, if any were made?</P>
      <P>In her reply, the Minister referred to the famous 1962 &ldquo;Act of Free Choice&rdquo; whereby 1,025 hand-picked Indonesian delegates voted on the future of West Irian. Would the Minister agree that the consultation was absolutely rigged?</P>
      <P>The Minister said such a review of decisions by the United Nations would be unprecedented, unusual and have many implications but, nevertheless, is it not necessary? If the UN Secretary General's representative, Mr. Fernando Orti-Sans, participated in justifying what was effectively a totally rigged consultation with the people of West Irian, does it not behove the Secretary General's office to examine this issue and bring some semblance of justice to the people of West Irian? There are three questions.</P>

      <P>I cannot properly say at this point that it was a rigged consultation process or election. That is for observers to say. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, has indicated that we are keeping this matter under close ongoing review and we expect that it will be considered at the General Affairs Council next week. The European Union has established a programme of political dialogue with Indonesia, the next session of which is expected to take place soon. We will make our concerns known bilaterally to the Indonesian authorities at every appropriate opportunity, including when the Minister, Deputy Cowen, meets the Indonesian Foreign Minister at the forthcoming ASEAN meeting.</P>
      <P>Human rights violations are certainly going on. I had an opportunity to meet the human rights representative for the area and we have asked him to provide us with suggestions as to how we can be of further assistance in providing training in human rights and capacity building to the indigenous population.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>On 30 April, German Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, travelled to Dublin to deliver an address to the Institute for European Affairs. He and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, took advantage of the visit to Dublin to meet briefly. Both Ministers had also met in Berlin on 7 March and their discussions in Berlin and in Dublin formed part of the normal round of bilateral contacts between EU partners. Deputy Cowen has no plans to travel to Germany in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no formal agenda for the meeting on 30 April. The two Ministers reviewed a num<Col N="1430" /> ber of key EU and international issues. The Minister for Foreign Affairs briefed his German counterpart on our preparations for ratification of the Treaty of Nice, and on the importance which the Government attaches to a positive result from the referendum. Mr. Fischer referred to the paper on the future of Europe which the German Social Democratic Party had produced, emphasising that it was a contribution to Germany's domestic debate, just as similar debates were taking place within all EU member states on how to come to grips with a Union of up to 27 members. Continuing with the theme of EU enlargement, they also discussed the freedom of movement issue.</P>
    <P>Turning to international issues, the two Ministers exchanged views on developments in the Middle East, and on the role the EU could play in facilitating agreement between the Israeli and Palestinian sides. They also discussed the situation in Kosovo and in the Western Balkans generally.</P>

That is the difference between the Petersberg Tasks and any aspect of neutrality. The Petersberg Tasks have nothing to do with a common defence or entering into a military defence pact.

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point to note about the document in question &ndash; the one in relation to a superstate &ndash; is that it was an internal draft party document and not an official statement of the German Government position. In any event, it is just one aspect of a wide-ranging debate on the future of Europe which, as agreed at Nice, will intensify over the coming months. We have already had contributions from the Belgian, Finnish and British Prime Ministers. The Taoiseach outlined the Government's views in his speech to the Irish Council of the European Movement on 6 November.</P>
      <P>While discussions are at an early stage and will be further reviewed by the forthcoming Councils in June and December, it is already clear that opinion within the European Union is not supportive of a radical departure from the existing institutional balance and does not favour ideas for a so-called federal superstate. Foreign Minister Fischer of Germany, during his recent visit to Dublin, emphasised that the European Union was a Union of states and of peoples and that the individual member states would remain the essential building block for the Union into the future. This is certainly the view of the Irish Government.</P>
      <P>As to the rapid reaction force, we consider that this is an aspect of Ireland owning up to our responsibilities with a view to undertaking the Petersberg Tasks of humanitarian and peacekeeping operations, and it is not a European army.</P>

      <P>Governments have traditionally availed of the period around St. Patrick's Day to capitalise on the goodwill and unparalleled opportunities generated by the celebrations to promote Ireland around the world. The Government decided that the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and distinguished Member of this House, Deputy David Andrews, would represent it at the St. Patrick's Day related activities in Los Angeles this year. There had been approaches to the Consulate General requesting Government representation from a number of event organisers, and appreciation has been expressed for the former Minister's attendance.</P>
      <P>During the visit, the former Minister, Deputy Andrews, represented the Government at a number of high profile events, including a civic reception with the City Council of Los Angeles at City Hall, a reception for key contacts in the business community, the Los Angeles St. Patrick's Day Parade and events hosted by Irish societies including the Irish American Bar Association and the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, where the former Minister availed of the opportunity to address more than 500 guests on developments in the Irish economy and the peace process.</P>
      <P>The former Minister travelled to Los Angeles from 14 to 18 March. He was accompanied by his wife and the cost of the visit is £12,218.04.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and a distinguished representative of Ireland abroad on many occasions, the Government felt it was appropriate that Deputy Andrews represented the Government and promoted Ireland in a city of the importance of Los Angeles at a time when there are many opportunities to showcase Ireland. There have been previous occasions when former Ministers were asked by the Government to represent it internationally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

      <P>Yes, I certainly agree that former Ministers who have specific experience in terms of Foreign Affairs or in other briefs are appropriate representatives of Ireland at such events, including St. Patrick's Day festivities. Every year, more and more events are hosted in foreign cities where there is an Irish diaspora and there is no more fitting a person than the former Minister, Deputy Andrews, to represent the Government on any occasion, including that one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposed to the late sitting on the grounds that the Order of Business is incomplete. At his first Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis as leader and president of the party, approximately four years ago, the Taoiseach promised to introduce legislation on standards in public office. In June of last year, that Bill, having been drawn up in a most complicated manner, was finally published and before Second Stage could be taken, the Bill was sent to a committee for consideration. It has not been returned to the House and we have not had a Second Stage debate on it. Until such time as this Bill &ndash; the Government's only item of legislation dealing with this area &ndash; and the various other Bills that are necessary to have enacted before the next general election to allow us to fight the campaign on the grounds of openness and transparency, we are not prepared to proceed with the Order of Business.</P>

I see no sign, other than platitudes uttered on infrequent Adjournment debates, that the Government is able to deal with this issue. There is nothing on <Col N="1437" /> the Order of Business to indicate that it intends to address this issue, which &ndash; with the exception of the energy centre Bill, which is not designed to effect realistic change in this area &ndash; does not appear to be on its programme.</P>

Many of those children have not been identified and others do not have any remedial attention. In light of the fact that this is national children's day, will the Taoiseach put it to the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Hanafin, that the House would be interested in making progress on this list of embarrassing failures?</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that one of the resonant phrases from the 1916 Proclamation is that of cherishing all children equally and that we need to look at the deficit in the provision of child care. Unfortunately, there are too many deficits. For many years these deficits were justified by the lack of resources available. As that impediment is no more, will the Taoiseach bring forward a comprehensive set of measures to deal with this enormous deficit so that we can cherish all the children of the nation?</P>

      <P>On the legislation mentioned by Deputy Noonan, the Children Bill will be before the House next week and the Bill concerning an ombudsman for children is due this session also. All issues on the children agenda may not be solved and one reason for that is that there will always be new aspirations. The Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Hanafin, has for the first time in the history of the State acquired the resources to build an enormous amount of new accommodation for children with difficulties.</P>
      <P>In recent years, we have been able to target resources through families in deprived and disadvantaged communities to help those in need. This has been facilitated by the excellent organisations involved in child issues in these areas. This targeting of resources will have to continue for some time because, as Deputy Quinn mentioned, all of the children of the nation have not been cherished equally and many were previously dealt with in centres, orphanages and institutions. Resources were not provided to the organisations who deal in this area. That has changed and Deputy Fahey, in his term as Minister with responsibility for children, began many useful projects which have now been carried on by Deputy Hanafin. This does not just concern investment in bricks and mortar through the capital programme, but the provision of child care workers, psychologists, and others in the health and child care areas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan would be the first to acknowledge that at last a Government has dealt with the issue of homelessness. At last, the resources have been given to deal with homelessness&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is appropriate, on the day that Members assembled at Arbour Hill to commemorate the patriot dead of 1916, that Deputy Quinn reminded the House of the Proclamation which committed the new nation to cherish all its children equally. On this national children's day, some 85 years after 1916, it is an absolute disgrace that the leader of an Opposition party must read out such an appalling list of failure in the fourth year of a Government. This is an attempt to get it to take action about the 1,250 homeless children on the streets of Dublin, about the one in four children in poverty and about the 66,000 children who leave school without literacy skills. Will the Taoiseach return to the drawing board? Does he realise that little can be done when responsibility for children crosses seven Government Departments? In the dying days of this Government, will he bring forward a realistic plan to deal with the plight of so many needy children across this broad range of issues?</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Noonan supports the elements of the national strategy for children which was launched last autumn. The resources provided for that are not adequate in all senses but they provide child care workers, bricks and mortar for facilities, people to work in disadvantaged areas, and the resources to support an excellent strategy which, for the first time ever, not only involves all the child care organisations in the State but also children themselves. I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, for her efforts. She is the first Minister since the foundation of the State to bring in such a comprehensive plan.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that a newspaper report was published on Saturday last to the effect that there was major fraud among sheep farmers in County Louth. Some 100 out of 175 farmers were examined following the disaster of foot and mouth disease, which affected the entire country but particularly County Louth. This examination revealed massive fraud on a scale that some suspected but most were shocked to see details of. What steps are the Government taking to ensure that the solidarity between town and country is not undermined by gangsters in any part of our society or economy undermining the trust of this community and defrauding tax-payers in the process? Urban and rural dwellers not directly engaged in agriculture have shown extraordinary solidarity in an attempt to successfully stamp out foot and mouth disease. The aforementioned gangsters may be responsible for the disease coming into this jurisdiction. What action does the Taoiseach propose to take to ensure the crisis does not recur?</P>

      <P>When the issue of fraud and sheep smuggling, particularly in Border areas, was raised previously, the Taoiseach informed the House that he believed such activity would not occur in the absence of the involvement of paramilitary organisations. Will he name the paramilitary organisations he believes are involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the action taken to prevent a recurrence of this crisis, a Bill containing strict penalties was unanimously passed in the House and its enforcement will be very important in ensuring people do not continue to take chances in this area for relatively small amounts of money. Prior to the foot and mouth crisis, I was not aware of how small are some of the amounts involved.</P>
      <P>Regulations have been passed in regard to traceability and tagging. This will be a mammoth task entailing the tagging of up to seven million animals. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development held a detailing meeting yesterday on these issues with representatives of farm organisations and agreement was reached on all the control mechanisms involved. I hope it will not be necessary to enforce the legislation.</P>
      <P>There is significant evidence of the involvement, to one extent or another, of paramilitary groups from all sides in the smuggling of animals, fuel etc. in the Border region. The Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Defence have stepped up Army and Garda patrols to address this activity. This is an ongoing problem. At least one shipment of sheep moved into six or seven counties throughout the country. Resources will be required to detect this activity in the future. If we are to ensure our good name in the area of animal exports to EU and world markets, we must provide for the traceability and secure transport of animals in line with normal practice. The Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Defence and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development have discussed these issues regularly in recent months as they have arisen time and again in the all-party group dealing with foot and mouth disease. This area will continue to be monitored when the foot and mouth crisis has passed. Some of those identified as having an involvement in this activity do not have any paramilitary associations.</P>

      <P>In spite of the Taoiseach's comprehensive reply, he was somewhat wide of the mark. If a company director is found to be in breach of the law under certain circumstances, he or she cannot become a director again in another company. It is time, in the interests of decent farmers, we did likewise in regard to farming. Legislation must be introduced to achieve this. Companies and small shopkeepers throughout the country are subject to Revenue Commissioner audits for which 48 hours notice is not provided and directors found to be in breach of company law are prohibited from taking up subsequent directorships. Will the Taoiseach give a clear indica<Col N="1444" /> tion that the 48 hour notice provision will be waived and, more specifically, that rogue farmers who behave in a criminal manner will have their licence to farm or entitlement to subsidies removed? I understand this is also the view of the ICMSA and IFA, a view which is in everyone's interests.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The process of getting this Bill through the Oireachtas is almost as leadránach as it will be for workers to bring employers, against whom they have a serious grievance, to heel under the provisions being put forward by the Minister of State in this legislation.</P>
      <P>The import of my amendments are that employers would be required to recognise and negotiate with trade unions and excepted bodies. This was the original intention of legislation such as this Bill. However, unfortunately this objective has been overthrown by the Minister of State and the Government and we have a watered-down mish-mash. Amendments tabled by Opposition Members will expose just how inadequate this Bill will be for workers seeking redress against employers who will prove difficult or recalcitrant &ndash; a breed which is alive and well.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's argument against my amendments and the idea that employers should be compelled to recognise and negotiate with trade unions, is based on a judgment given in the High Court in 1979 or 1980 in what is known as the Abbott and Whelan case. This judgment is frequently used to argue that making it compulsory for employers to recognise trade unions would be unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister of State did not use the opportunity provided by the introduction of this legislation to test this issue again and, if there was a permanent block, to consider a constitutional amendment. However, having examined the case a little, I am surprised that so much reliance is placed on this judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge this was an unreported judgment and so, unless the Minister of State can tell me otherwise, all we have is a <Col N="1450" /> decision. I have not seen the reasoning behind the judgment. The Minister of State has relied on the decision in this case which is based on Article 40.6 of the Constitution. Having examined this Article the decision seems extraordinary. Article 40.6 guarantees liberty for the exercise of certain rights by citizens, subject to public order and morality.</P>
    <P>Article 40.6(i) guarantees, &ldquo;The right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions&rdquo;. Article 40.6(ii) guarantees, &ldquo;The right of the citizens to assemble peaceably and without arms&rdquo;, and Article 40.6(iii) guarantees, &ldquo;The right of the citizens to form associations and unions&rdquo;. How this Article can be turned into a right of recalcitrant employers not to recognise trade unions should be tested again in the courts. The Minister of State could have done so by introducing a full-blooded trade union recognition Bill which, if necessary, could have been referred to the Supreme Court for an opinion before being signed into law. Unfortunately the Government did not take this course because the Government is clearly not committed to compelling employers to deal with workers in a reasonable manner without workers having to drag employers round the houses, as is provided for in this legislation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State has reconsidered my amendment. If accepted, the amendment would result in a real trade union recognition Bill which would compel employers to recognise and negotiate with unions once members of a company's work force notified their employer that such unions existed. This would resolve the problem of recalcitrant employers being difficult with regard to the membership of trade unions, avoiding their responsibilities and, in general, trying to deny workers rights which had to be hard fought for over 200 years, if we are to go back to the origins of the first associations which led to the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>The history of trade unionism in this country is such that at least one pivotal moment in Irish history, namely, the 1913 lock-out, emanates from the refusal of employers to recognise and negotiate with trade unions. It is unfortunate the Government did not recognise this fact and legislate to guarantee this right for which traditionally people have struggled and which is seen as very important by generations of workers. Some of the greatest leaders of the working class movement such as James Connolly, Jim Larkin, and nameless men and women who lived before, during and after their time have struggled for this right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on record as saying that precious legislative time ought not be taken up by this Bill, as I cannot find any merit or purpose in it. The Bill was born out of the Ryanair dispute and the understandable wish to avoid the chaos which occurred in that instance. However, the end product does not advance the cause and it would be better if this Bill was not enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1451" /> However, it is clear the Minister of State intends to see this Bill enacted. The Bill started life under the guise of a Labour Party Private Members' Bill known as the Trade Union Recognition Bill but has become the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins's amendment seeks to concentrate on the long title of the Bill. However, the substantial point is that the reason the title of the Bill has changed is that the purpose of the Bill has changed. The Bill is no longer about trade union recognition. There is no right of representation for trade unions or excepted bodies under the Bill. If there is no right of representation, there is no right of recognition and, therefore, it is not a recognition Bill. Our Bill provided a formula where if a trade union was representative of a substantial proportion of the workers, it would have to be recognised. However, there is now no requirement or compulsion to recognise the trade union, but a tortuous and long-winded procedure where the State may intervene in certain circumstances and fix the pay and conditions of the workers represented by the trade union. I am not sure that is a good principle. As I said on Committee Stage, it is capable of being misrepresented.</P>
    <P>Competitor bodies to the Industrial Development Authority may seek to make mischief with the Bill. Although in this jurisdiction trade union recognition is not required, there will be circumstances where the State may intervene and fix the wages and conditions of the workers. It is an extraordinary compromise. As the Government heads towards an imminent general election when valuable legislation going through the House will fall, it would have been better if this Bill had been rostered in a fashion that ensured it fell and would not be resurrected in the future. However, the Minister of State appears intent on pressing ahead.</P>
    <P>In the Official Report of the Committee Stage debate, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am prepared to make changes to the legislation on foot of some of the amendments tabled and suggestions made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, I do not recall him accepting too many amendments and I presume that means he will accept a number of amendments today. I welcome that move in anticipation. I can see the Minister of State in the corner, saying that the Government legislated for the recognition of trade unions and that it is the workers' friend. He and the Taoiseach see themselves in that role, but that is not what the Bill is about and it is important that point is put on the record at the outset of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say the Bill was earth shattering or radical. However, Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Higgins are aware of the background to it and they <Col N="1452" /> will recall the Ryanair dispute. The Bill will deal with that and similar situations. In the context of the Government being the workers' friend, we are trying to put forward a pro-worker position. As Deputy Rabbitte is aware, the Bill will deal with cases similar to the Ryanair dispute where an employer will not engage with the Labour Court. Under section 4, an employer can be summoned to the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Rabbitte belittles the Bill, he is belittling the social partnership process because, as he is aware, the legislation stems from the social partners. I acknowledge it is difficult for the Opposition to hit the Government when a social partnership system is in place. The Deputy served in a Government that supported that process although his partners in that Administration, the Fine Gael Party, did not always do so. However, it supports it now and I acknowledge that fact. Nevertheless, it is not fair to rubbish the Bill because it is an important development and it stems from the social partnership system. I asked the social partners to consider this matter and to come back to me. The Bill is the result and there is no need to give it much more time, although that is a matter for the Deputy who, on the one hand, described the Bill as worthless but, on the other, said it would be a disincentive to investment.</P>
      <P>The amendments are opposed. There was a reference to the Abbott and Whelan case, but a range of case law throws doubt on the constitutionality of the amendments. Aside from the legal argument, the amendments conflict with the approach agreed by the social partners. This point should be noted. The approach involves two strands. The first is the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution under which the parties can engage in resolving claims. This code involves referral to the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission. Failing agreement, the parties can refer the issues in dispute to the Labour Court for a non-binding recommendation, which is the final step in the voluntary process.</P>
      <P>Second, the Bill deals with a situation where an employer has failed to observe a provision of the code of practice or has failed to observe it in good faith in accordance with section 2(1)(<i>b</i>). Under the Bill, claims can be processed to finality despite the fact that the employer has not engaged in collective bargaining. It is significant that finality is attached to the Bill. The legislation reflects a consensus view of the social partners on how to deal with difficult disputes in a structured manner. It is incumbent on me to legislate in this area to try to avoid the damaging disputes that arose in the past, including the Ryanair dispute to which I referred and the Nolan Transport and Pat the Baker cases. They are examples of what the Bill seeks to address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation offers a framework to resolve such disputes peacefully. The approach of successive Governments has been to underpin the voluntarist approach and to allow the social partners to reach as much agreement as possible in <Col N="1453" /> direct discussions. As the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, I have continued this approach. In the aftermath of the Ryanair dispute, I requested ICTU and IBEC to redouble their efforts to reach consensus on disputes where collective bargaining was absent. It is a tribute to them both that they succeeded in agreeing the approach outlined in the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution and the Bill. In keeping with the policy of underpinning the voluntarist approach followed by successive Governments, I am not disposed to deviating from the consensus agreed by ICTU and IBEC. This may appear repetitive, but that is the reality of the position. The Bill allows a trade union to process to finality a grievance or claim on behalf of employees. This is the agreed approach of the social partners and I am not disposed to varying it.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> There is a total contradiction in the Minister of State's statement. He mentioned the voluntarist approach, but the Bill purports to deal with employers who do not voluntarily come to the negotiating table. What does the voluntarist approach have to do with such people? The Minister of State relies on the so-called social partnership process, but the Bill is supposed to deal with employers who do not consider themselves part of any such process. To invoke that mantra is to ignore the reality of what the Bill is supposed to address, namely employers who do not engage and who are not prepared to sit down and talk to their employees. The Minister referred to the issue of seeing a dispute through to finality.</P>

        <b>:</b> Yes. As I said previously, some hapless trade union official could find himself or herself up to two and a half years after the dispute began, chasing paper around the Circuit Court, High Court or other courts. By then, the issue will have long passed and workers may have been victimised out of the work force. This happened in the case of Ryanair where if workers could not be got rid of one way, they were got rid of another way. Unfortunately, by that time, employers could have shut up shop in the event of a recession and be long gone, perhaps even out of the country. A company and its work force could be long gone before a case reached finality in the courts. That is the reason these amendments should be accepted by the Minister of State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4. to delete lines 14 to 18.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to delete section 2(1)(<i>d</i>). This is the key section of the Bill where the court may intervene. If a trade union requests the court to intervene in a conflict where the issue is trade union recognition, the court, notwithstanding anything in the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 1990, may agree to examine the dispute.</P>
      <P>However, the court cannot do so unless the terms set out in section 2(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) are met. These are rigorous demands on workers. The first condition is that the court must be satisfied it is not the practice of the employer to engage in negotiations with his or her workers. I do not know how the court satisfies itself about that, but I presume the employer concerned would have some type of track record for failing to engage in collective bargaining with his or her workers. The second condition is that the court must be satisfied the employer has failed to observe a provision of the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution. That is a rigorous test. The third condition is that the trade union or the employees must not have acted in a manner which, in the opinion of the court, frustrated the employer in observing the provisions of such a code. The interesting aspect to that is that the court not only must be happy the trade union did not frustrate the employer but also that the employees did not do so. That is very rigorous, but we are prepared to live with it.</P>
      <P>However, the addition of section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) is a belt and braces job. The requirement in this paragraph is that the court must be satisfied the trade union, excepted body or the employees did not have recourse to industrial action after the dispute in question was referred to the commission in accordance with the provisions of such code of practice. That is a belt and braces situation. The three previous conditions are very rigorous and demanding. Notwithstanding that, for the court to intervene under this legislation, it must be satisfied not only that the trade union did not have recourse to industrial action, something I can understand, but also that the employees, even in the heat of battle and despite the dynamic of industrial relations, did not engage in anything that could be termed as industrial action, even for a brief period such as a day, a half day or an hour. If the court is not satisfied, it cannot intervene.</P>
      <P>We lose sight in discussing the Bill of the fact that we are dealing with recalcitrant employers. We are not dealing with normal industrial relations where normal employers deal with normal unions. By definition we are dealing with the employer who does not recognise collective bargaining or a trade union. That is the prerequisite. In such circumstances to impose an obligation on the court to be satisfied that there is no recourse to industrial action is too rigorous.</P>
      <P>Despite what I have said about the Bill, I accept that the Minister of State has a different view to me and is entitled to that. I take that in good faith. However, if I accept the Minister of State's conviction at face value, even from his point of view, this measure I have discussed is unwise. As sure as we debate this on Report Stage, the day will come when, because of some precipitous action in an environment of conflict, workers will down tools for an hour or whatever with the result that section 2 may not be invoked and the dispute may not be referred to the court. We will regret that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any set of circumstances could be involved. A shop steward could be dismissed, for example, or disciplinary action may be taken against workers. Workers could react in the heat of the moment to such a situation, even after the matter has been referred to the Labour Relations Commission. All one need do is cast one's mind back to Ryanair. Is anyone seriously telling me that, without mentioning the name of any individual in Ryanair, that company was not capable of taking action which would provoke workers to down <Col N="1457" /> tools or whatever, even after the matter was referred to the Labour Relations Commission?</P>
    <P>We are tying our hands on this. The provision is unwise and is a belt and braces provision. Even at this late stage the Minister of State should leave paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) which, combined, are very demanding and onerous, and excise paragraph (<i>d</i>). I could understand if that paragraph had stated that the obligation was on the trade union not to have had official recourse to industrial action after referral of its grievance to the Labour Relations Commission. If the employees, separately from their trade union and notwithstanding what advice they may get from it, decide they have had enough, are unwilling to take any more from their employer and engage on certain action, the court may not hear their case. That defeats the essence and thrust of the Bill. I appeal to the Minister of State to take that on board at this late stage.</P>

        <b>:</b> I support what Deputy Rabbitte said and add to it by saying that this provision can paralyse the legislation. Now that the Minister of State, with the support of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael, has rendered impossible a proper trade union recognition Bill, we must examine more minutely the workings of this legislation and the machinery it provides. Deputy Rabbitte correctly outlined a number of possibilities for industrial action. With workers facing a period of up to 18 months before what the Minister calls &ldquo;finality&rdquo; of their grievance might be arrived at, there is an invitation to an employer to take provocative action. What is a group of workers to do if, for example, an employer dismisses them? Are they to wait 18 months or two years before the matter is resolved while, meanwhile they have no jobs and their mortgages will not be frozen in the same manner as the industrial relations process. This clause is completely pro-employer and will render the legislation meaningless, especially when workers face provocative situations with employers taking high handed actions, either deliberately to provoke or because it is their normal practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State must answer these points. What does he say to workers who make their grievances known but who find this followed by dismissals, for example? The Minister of State says that if these workers go on strike they will lose their right to have recourse to the legislation. The situation is even worse than that. The employer can set up a situation where the court would be forbidden from intervening under the legislation. In a situation where a trade union, the excepted body or the employees have not had recourse to industrial action, the employer could set up a few stool pigeons to take industrial action. The employer could then argue that because employees have had recourse to industrial action the process cannot go any further. It is in the hands of an employer to throw a spanner <Col N="1458" /> in the works of this machinery even before it is put into use.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is one of the amendments the Minister of State intends to accept but did not tell us so in advance. I hope that is the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">

      <P>In adding my voice to that of my colleague I speak from personal experience. My first job at national level in the trade union movement was as national organiser. My job was to organise workers into a trade union. I know how long that can take, standing outside factory gates, distributing leaflets, persuading workers to attend meetings and trying to organise them. Often an organiser can persuade some workers but not others, and such a situation might continue for months or even years.</P>
      <P>If this section was allowed to remain in the Bill it would create a number of problems. It would make a bad situation even worse because workers would come to the conclusion that the only action open to them was unofficial action. The Bill deals, not with employees who do not wish to join a trade union but with employers who do not wish their employees to join one, even though we are told they have a constitutional right to join a trade union. If this legislation was applied it would have the opposite effect to that intended. Any employer worth his salt could sabotage the operation of this section. Instead of strengthening the Bill, this section would weaken it substantially. Deputy Rabbitte has reminded us how Ryanair used every possible tactic to resist unionisation of their employees. This section gives freedom to an employer of that type to disrupt and frustrate any attempt at organisation by employees. I hope the Minister will accept the advice of Deputy Rabbitte and accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In spite of what Deputy Higgins might say about my party I am inclined to the view that there is a point to much of what he has said. I ask the Minister of State to address the Deputy's concerns. If the Minister of State is not prepared to do so in a satisfactory manner he must accept that he is introducing a problem rather than assisting in the resolution of one. The maintenance of industrial peace should be to the fore of any industrial relations legislation and this Bill is no exception to that.</P>
      <P>I foresee a difficulty if the process was deliberately frustrated by an employer who wished to circumvent the legislation and ensure that workers would not have recourse to the legislation as intended. A number of important questions have been asked but the Minister of State did not address them during the debate on Committee Stage. This is the last opportunity the House will have to allay the fears expressed by the previous speakers. There is an onus on the Minister of State to allay doubts and deal with the problems outlined by Deputies. Otherwise this section could be a recipe for frustration not intended by the Minister of State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions. There are concerns about this section and I will try to address them.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to the amendment but I will clarify my opposition and deal with the issues. The concerns expressed by Deputies are genuine but they are dealt with in another section. The effect of section 2(1)<i>(d)</i> is to set, as a precondition to an investigation by the Labour Court the requirement that there be no recourse to industrial action. The ban on industrial action is a cornerstone of the legislation and in deciding on the package of measures contained in the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution and the provision of this legislation, the high level group agreed that the maintenance of industrial peace was essential during the process. That was its position. Where parties have embarked on a procedure to resolve a dispute it would be standard practice for both sides to refrain from any form of coercion in advance of the procedure being completed. The compromise reached between the ICTU and IBEC places obligations both on workers and employers. It is essential that during the entire process the employer follows the procedure in good faith and the employees refrain from industrial action.</P>
      <P>Having said all that, I recognise the point the Deputies have made. On Committee Stage I obviously listened carefully to what Deputy Rabbitte and others said. Following their representations, I accepted an amendment to section 8 which involved a modification whereby a total ban on industrial action was changed to discretion being given to the court to decide if some industrial action could be excused, and the court would continue the process. If workers take industrial action, they put themselves outside the process. The reward, if I can put it that way, for staying within the process is a binding decision on their grievance about which the employer has no discretion. I have given the court discretion as to whether to proceed with an investigation where industrial action is taken during the statutory process.</P>
      <P>Section 8, as it now stands, following amendment on Committee Stage, gives the court discretion to proceed with an investigation where it has been satisfied by a trade union or accepted body that it would be reasonable to do so having regard to all the circumstances of the dispute. This deals with the concerns expressed by Deputies Bell, Flanagan, Joe Higgins and Rabbitte in that the Labour Court can now exercise its judgment. Also, if it envisages a situation with regard to an employer who might, as Deputy Flanagan said, inspire or cause industrial action in a given situation, all these circumstances can be taken into account. In other words, each case can be looked at by the Labour Court within its own context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My officials have discussed the legislation with the Labour Court's representatives who have agreed with what is included in the Bill. We have made an amendment to section 8 with which we <Col N="1460" /> will deal shortly. I totally accept the points the Deputies have made. In reply to Deputy Bell, let me clarify that industrial action, official or unofficial, would collapse the process unless the Labour Court excused the action under section 8.</P>
    <P>To recap, a trade union can take the traditional route of industrial action, as before, but if a trade union seeks the benefit of this process &ndash; that is, a binding outcome to their claim &ndash; it must maintain industrial peace during the whole process. This is an essential and fair balance. This is clever legislation in many ways, but it is, clearly, a result of compromise between employers and employee representatives. I have acknowledged this time and again. I am suggesting that, to the best of my ability, I have accommodated the Deputies' genuine concerns, although not in this section, but in section 8. I am opposing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty with that. The Minister of State is referring to the existing section 8(2) about which I am not entirely clear, although, as the Minister of State said, we will have the opportunity to discuss it. I would have thought that if the kind of catch-all discretion the Minister of State is suggesting was being provided for the court, the section would state: &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything in section 2, the court shall have the discretion, etc.&rdquo;  It is not clear, however, from section 8(2) that the court will have that discretion in all circumstances. It seems that no matter what the court says, unless it is expressly provided for in section 8(2), the provisions of section 2(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) will still have to be met. If the provisions of paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) will have to be met, I am not clear how the court will have discretion unless it is expressly provided for.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell made the point that it would be desirable for the court to have discretion. We can be so preoccupied with arranging nice, neat legislation that in the quiet of the Chamber may make a great deal of sense. All one has to do is look outside the House today, however, to discover that industrial relations conflicts do not necessarily happen in this kind of environment with everybody reflecting rationally on what is happening.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong to place an imposition on the court that it could not intervene in anything that might be termed industrial action. I remember that, in 1990, we argued long and hard about the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;. The definition is very wide nowadays and anything that may be termed as industrial action would prevent the court from intervening. The court is not free to intervene unless the provisions of section 2(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) are met. Section 2(1) states</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 1990, at the request of a trade union or excepted body, the Court may investigate a trade dispute where the Court is satisfied that . . .  (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> I am not entirely with the Minister of State when he says that when we come to section 8(2) it will meet our fears. Is section 8(2) meant to be a catch-all that states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the court itself, having heard the parties or having examined the issue, decides that, notwithstanding all of these sections, it seems to us that it is in the public interest that we should proceed to investigation, it shall so proceed&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>That seems to be what the Minister of State wants and it is, certainly, what I want, but the court may not do so under the preconditions laid down. Otherwise, one would need a catch-all section stating:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding anything in section 2, the court may at its discretion, etc.&rdquo;, or whatever the appropriate wording may be.</P>
    <P>That would be very wise.</P>
    <P>In dealing with civil law, we frequently give the court discretion to make certain judgment calls. That is normal practice, but what we have in this case is the downside of legislation by negotiation. It is so prescriptive that it is likely to be counterproductive.</P>
    <P>On the basis of what the Minister of State has told us so far, I cannot see how the fears which prompted the amendment in my name and that of Deputy Joe Higgins can be met. The last thing we should be doing is prescribing that the court may not intervene in what is likely to be a situation of conflict where tempers may be warm and the environment is not like that which prevails in the Chamber. The last thing we should be doing is putting obstacles in the way of the court. The court ought to be free to say: &ldquo;We are proceeding with this investigation. The fact that there was a stoppage between 8 o'clock and 9 o'clock this morning is neither here nor there&rdquo;. I do not want to start adducing examples in this debate, but one need go no further than Kingsbridge today to understand that actions are taken in the industrial relations environment that may not make much sense to the great majority of the public. That is the nature of the factures that take place in industrial relations. We should be encouraging the court to use it powers where reasonable, rather than putting impediments in its way.</P>

        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> This is most puzzling. I fear the Minister is trying to be so clever with this legislation that he has tied himself up in a legal knot because two different stages of the procedure are involved. Section 2(1) states, &ldquo;Notwithstanding anything contained in the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 1990, at the request of a trade union or excepted body, the Court may investigate a trade dispute where the Court is satisfied that&ndash;-. . . (<i>d</i>) the trade union or excepted body or employees . . . have not had recourse to industrial action . . . &rdquo;. Section 8, however, deals with the procedure where it is already in train. Section 8(1) states, &ldquo;. . . the Court shall cease its investigation or review. . . &rdquo;. <Col N="1462" /> That presumes it has already begun its investigation or review but it may not do so in the first instance if industrial action has taken place under section 2(1)(<i>d</i>).</P>
      <P>Section 8 does not correct or make provision for section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) and, therefore, there is a complete contradiction. The Minister of State's solution to the problems raised by myself and previous speakers is not a solution. He may point out when he replies that somewhere during the logical progression, something else has intervened between sections 2 and 8 to verify what he said. Section 8(1) states, &ldquo;. . . the court shall cease its investigation or review under <i>section 6</i> and withdraw any recommendation where, either at the request of the employer or on its own initiative, the Court has satisfied itself that industrial action in relation to the dispute that is the subject of an investigation has taken place&rdquo;. The Minister of State is relying on section 8(2) to redeem the situation. It states, &ldquo;If. . . the Court is satisfied by a trade union. . . that it is reasonable to proceed with its investigation or review under <i>section 6</i> it shall so proceed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 8(2) will never be invoked if the court is prevented under section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) from accepting the case in the first place or at least proceeding with it. This is not a solution to the problem. The simplest solution would be to delete section 2(1)(<i>d</i>).</P>

      <P>My advice is that the work we have done on section 8 provides flexibility to the Labour Court to address the scenarios outlined by the Deputies. The text of section 8(2), which will be addressed later, is adequate to enable the court to exercise its discretion on the question of whether the industrial action taken should collapse the process. I have endeavoured to address the concerns instanced by various Deputies. I am in the business of promoting industrial peace. Given the industrial action that has taken place in recent times, any of us who was not proactively promoting industrial peace in anything we did would not be doing his or her job properly.</P>
      <P>The cornerstone of the legislation is industrial peace, no matter what formula is agreed. The high level group recommended this course of action. The Labour Court has examined the legislation and is satisfied it can work with it. We will address section 8(2) shortly. I am not in a position to make any amendments at this stage. I am satisfied there is a connection between sections 2 and 8(2) and that section 8(2) is strong enough to address the concerns raised by Deputies. I will not accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 4, line 21, after &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including labour relations practices engaged <Col N="1463" /> in by the employer or an associated employer in another employment including an employment outside the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment relates to section 2(2), which states, &ldquo;In the course of an investigation under <i>subsection (1) </i>the Court shall have regard to the entirety of labour relations practices in the employment concerned&rdquo;. I asked the Minister of State on Committee Stage what was the definition of &ldquo;employment concerned&rdquo;. It is defined nowhere in the legislation and he was unable to say what it means. Does it mean that the court, when examining these questions, at the preliminary hearing, is free to examine the practices generally among the company's workers wherever they are employed or does it mean that during an investigation the court is restricted to a particular location?</P>
    <P>Presumably after all the conditions have been met section 2(2) is arrived at, which states, &ldquo;In the course of an investigation under <i>subsection (1) </i>the Court shall have regard to the entirety of labour relations practices in the employment concerned&rdquo;. I know this is not the stage for the Minister of State to give us tutorials on what a subsection means. I have glanced at the record of the Committee Stage debate and the Minister of State did not tell us the purpose of this section.</P>
    <P>I would have thought the purpose of it is that if the court is confronted by an allegation by a trade union or excepted body relating to a recalcitrant employer who refuses to recognise trade unions, resists trade union recognition, will not acknowledge collective bargaining and will not submit to the voluntarist practices involved in industrial relations to which the Minster of State referred, the court is entitled to search and ascertain whether that is the reputation of the employer. Does the employer, for example, recognise any other category of worker who might have more muscle? Does he recognise the craft workers? Does he recognise the pilots? If so, why does he not recognise the baggage handlers and so on?</P>
    <P>It is entirely reasonable to expect that the court would examine the totality of labour practices in the employment but why is employment defined in the mind of the Minister of State as meaning only employment at one location within this jurisdiction? On Committee Stage I instanced ALDI as a recent example. ALDI is trade union organised in Germany but is not in Dublin and the company resisted trade union recognition to the point of a dispute. What is the disbarment on the court examining the position in Germany and receiving information from whomsoever supplies it about practices in Germany? If a giant multiple is trade union organised in Germany, what is its supposed philosophical objection to being trade union organised in Ireland, another member state of the European Union?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State says &ndash; I cannot follow this &ndash; that he could not possibly accept an amendment that would create an artificial link <Col N="1464" /> between Irish labour relations practices and those in other jurisdictions. Why not? What would be wrong with such a link? What would it do? Are we fearful that it would do some violence to our labour relations machinery? All the court wants to know is whether an employer is entitled to resist trade union recognition or what do we learn from an examination of practices followed by the employer, whether in Galway, Germany or Dublin.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister of State's reasons for rejecting the amendments we have tabled so far. I draw his attention to his own statement on Committee Stage when he stated: &ldquo;I am prepared to make changes to the legislation on foot of some of the amendments tabled&rdquo;. I am aware that that is part of his conciliatory armoury, but when will he accept some of the amendments? Will he keep us here all night? At the speed we are going we will have to reconvene on another day unless he comes on board soon.</P>
    <P>The amendment is sensible and would add clarity to the Bill. The Minister of State has not defined in the Bill the term &ldquo;employment concerned&rdquo;. What will happen if ALDI opens another store in Drogheda? Is the Minister of State saying that it would be okay to look at the store in Drogheda because they would be both in the Irish jurisdiction, but if it opens a store in Newry, we could not, possibly, look at it because it would create an artificial link with industrial relations practices in another jurisdiction? That seems to be fantastic. What if it were to close the store in Drogheda because the pound was more favourable in Newry? We could not look at it in Newry, but we could look at it in Dundalk. I cannot see any sense in that. There is no sense in the Minister of State's reply in terms of Committee Stage when we tried to tease it out.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is advised by one of the great internationalists who did his time on behalf of the State in the European Union and knows all about the links with Germany and so on. I am puzzled that he would receive advice that the amendment would create an artificial link. I would have thought that his advice would be that it would facilitate convergence among the EU member states&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>I support the amendment in the name of Deputy Rabbitte which is eminently reasonable. It would be to the advantage of employees if it were included in the legislation which is being brought forward because of the pressure exerted by groups of employees placed in a very disadvantageous posi<Col N="1465" /> tion by virtue of the high-handed methods of certain employers. The initial intention of the Bill has been transmogrified virtually beyond recognition, but we try to salvage the best deal possible within what the Government is offering for those workers who will rely on the legislation at some critical time for them in the future.</P>
      <P>My reading of the amendment is that it would insist that the higher standards that apply in any employment or associated employment of the employer, the subject of the complaint, be emulated and insisted upon for the employees making the complaint that would trigger the mechanisms of the legislation. Other countries have a longer track record of labour legislation. In some cases, as a result either of legislation or the strength of the trade union movement at particular locations, workers in western Europe may have secured from the employer or the associates of the Irish employer standards that have not been implemented here. Why not require that those higher standards be examined with a view to deciding what is right for Irish workers?</P>
      <P>Some of the great organisers of the trade union and labour movement of the past, the pioneers, often made the point that workers had no country. In this case, it is totally artificial, especially in the era of globalisation which is being driven by multinationals or other powerful companies. It is particularly the case that if higher standards are obtaining in associated employers or the same employer outside the borders of the State, they should be able to be examined with a view to securing a fair deal for the workers in question who have triggered this industrial relations machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification from the Minister of State on this point because the court must have regard to the entirety of the situation, but what is that entirety? Is it the entire spectrum of associated employment in a particular concern or a specific concern throughout other jurisdictions? Deputy Rabbitte pointed to the practical example of a concern which may have a plant in Dublin, the subject matter of a dispute, an associated concern in Drogheda and a further associated concern across the Border. Let us take it a stage further. If the concern in Dublin was the only concern within the jurisdiction, with other associated concerns in France and Germany, presumably the court would have to have regard to the position in Germany in France. If that is the case, what is the play about the artificial link the Minister of State is talking about? Where does he stand as far as this link is concerned?</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the amendment. At least if the amendment is accepted we will be in a position to determine the exact situation, because it appears to advocate a number of clearly defined parameters. Whereas, as it stands, the subsection gives rise to an element of doubt and uncertainty and is obviously confusing. Let us clarify the position, in so far as is possible.</P>

    <Col N="1466" />
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will attempt to clarify matters. The phrase &ldquo;shall have regard to the entirety of labour relations&rdquo; is broad and, moreover, it is mandatory in nature. It is designed to enable the court to adopt the widest possible attitude in considering a dispute. It should be borne in mind that it could be to the advantage or disadvantage of either party to look at labour relations practices outside the State. I remind Deputies that employees in a similar company in another country might not have access to a trade union. Nothing in the phrase restricts the court from hearing evidence from either party as to what goes on elsewhere in the company or employment. That obviously includes companies in other jurisdictions. The concerns of Deputies are met by the current legislation.</P>
      <P>To the extent that Labour Court recommendations or determinations will not deal with arrangements for collective bargaining, I do not feel I should add the dimension proposed by Deputy Rabbitte in a legal text which mandates the Labour Court regarding what it shall or shall not consider. The balance of advantage in our voluntary system lies with less rather than more legal prescription, thus affording the Labour Court wide discretion in considering the submissions of both parties. I remind Deputies, before they press the amendment, that there is a possibility they could be proposing an amendment to the legislation which might militate against workers. In my opinion, we should leave it to the Labour Court to consider situations not just in Ireland but also in other jurisdictions. That is the meaning of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is that, as Deputy Flanagan stated, it does not say that. I still do not know why that is the case. The only terms defined in the Bill are &ldquo;commission&rdquo;, &ldquo;court&rdquo;, &ldquo;accepted body&rdquo; and &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;. There is no definition of the employment concerned.</P>
      <P>My second point is that, as the Minister of State indicated, it could work to the advantage or disadvantage of workers. However, what weight of disadvantage would result from being free to look at the practice elsewhere in Europe? If the company is organised elsewhere in Europe, that is an advantage from the point of view of the workers. If it is not organised elsewhere in Europe, this probably does no more than demonstrate that the employer also has an anti-union ethos in the relevant jurisdiction. I do not see how that is a disadvantage to workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the position of the union of which Deputy Bell and I are members. I offer a hypothetical situation where that union, SIPTU, might organise a cement plant in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency and it might <Col N="1467" /> organise a similar plant immediately across the Border. Let us suppose that the plant south of the Border resists trade union organisation of the kind as envisaged in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Yes. It makes no sense that the union that represents workers a few hundred metres across the Border ought not be free to examine the practices there as well. The Minister of State knows that what he and I say in this debate will be of little enough interest if this legislation is ever contested. If a buccaneering Michael O'Leary of the concrete industry decides to go to court, what the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, said on the day the Bill was passing through the House will be of little enough interest to the judge. He or she will make their mind up on the basis of what is contained in the section. Under the section, the &ldquo;employment&rdquo; appears to mean the cement plant south of the Border and does not refer also to the plant north of the Border. In the interests of clarity, we should deal with that matter. I do not see how it will diminish the Bill in any fashion.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The Minister of State must clarify the issue. To take up the point made by Deputy Rabbitte, in my opinion the judge will pay no attention whatsoever to what was said in the Dáil and will base his or her judgment on what is contained in the Act. That is why the amendment is so important. The Minister of State said that the Labour Court shall not be precluded from looking at practices in other employments and in other countries, but that is different from requiring it to look. He also warned that it could be to the disadvantage of workers. I do not see that as a danger because when the court is looking at other employments &ndash; even those outside the State &ndash; it will, presumably, choose best, not worst, practice. If the court is required to examine practices in other employments, in associated employments and in those in other jurisdictions, it would be with the view to transposing best practices and requiring employers to emulate them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;The dismissal of an employee for availing of the provisions of section 2 or otherwise in connection with seeking or intending to seek redress under this Act shall be deemed to be an unfair dismissal for the purposes of section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is important because it purports to deal with the kind of situation to which we referred earlier where a trade union and its members scrupulously observe the requirements set out in section 2(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) and, despite this, the employer dismisses the shop steward. As the section stands, the shop steward will stand dismissed for, in my view, up to two years. On Committee Stage we discussed how long the entire process would take from start to finish and I believe the Minister of State has acknowledged that 18 months is a reasonable estimate in this regard. If a trade union does everything required under the legislation and manages to keep the employees in line and those employees observe the spirit and letter of the legislation and cannot have recourse to industrial action and they are nonetheless dismissed in the circumstances I have described, that, as my amendment suggests, ought to be regarded as an unfair dismissal within the meaning of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977. Anything else is a travesty.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister of State wants to preserve industrial peace. If someone who obeys all the rules and observes the strait-jacket imposed here is dismissed, what is the point in reverting to this a year and a half later? The person has lost their job. It is irretrievable breakdown or whatever phrase we use in marital legislation. He or she will not get back into employment. It seems it should be by definition an unfair dismissal and that we should proceed under the Unfair Dismissals Act, separate from whatever comes out of the dispute. Both sides of this House know that, as regards both sides of the table of industrial relations, the chances of that person going back into employment &ndash; I have the stripes on my back to show such circumstances &ndash; are virtually nil. The Minister of State should go through the cases of the unfair dismissals tribunal and calculate how many were reinstated in their employment or re-engaged by their employer even in circumstances where they won their case. The predominant redress is compensation, not being reinstated in the job. I advocate that the Minister of State should accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I support what my colleague said. My experience, particularly in latter years through dealing with unfair dismissals and redundancy cases, is that 99.9% of all people in that category opt for compensation rather than for their job back. The employer does not want them back, they are too long detached from their employment and too much bitterness has built up. I am sure the Minister of State would find in the records of the Department that a substantial number of people take a cash settlement rather than look for their employment back.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I strongly support the amendment. Why can this not be included in the legislation? It does not have implications for anything else in the legislation or for the other machinery. It is a fall back or a protection for workers who, by definition of using this legislation, would be in a vulnerable position. The Minister of State seems to forget that point. The reason this legislation has been introduced, inadequate as it is, is that we are dealing with ruthless employers. Devices will be used to get rid of those employees if they invoke industrial relations machinery to attempt to get justice <i>vis-à-vis </i>the employers. In the event of them being dismissed, they should at least have this fall back. I reread the debate on Committee Stage when the Minister of State admitted the process could take 18 months. It could be a lot longer. I do not see any reason the Minister of State cannot agree with this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Our legal advice is that section 6(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, covers a situation where a trade union invokes an investigation under section 2 in respect of members in a particular employment and the employer then sacks one or more of those employees. I indicated on Committee Stage that I wished to see this legislation in operation for a period before considering whether the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, need to be revised. A formal review clause of this legislation is incorporated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Notwithstanding this overall review, I have committed to specifically reviewing the need to protect employee representatives from victimisation under this legislation. I recall that Members of this House accepted my undertaking on this issue on Committee Stage. I maintain the position I adopted on Committee Stage and I oppose this amendment. I gave commitments that I would revert to the House on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to race against the clock on this important issue. I accept the Minister of State's good faith that he might come back to renovate the Unfair Dismissals Act at some date in the future. However, I am sure he would be the first to admit that he will not get parliamentary time too easily, even if he had the Bill ready, to do that in the immediate future. This is a promise for some time in the future. He admit<Col N="1470" /> ted on Second Stage that the existing provisions under the Unfair Dismissals Act do not go as far as the amendment we are now discussing. He said the Unfair Dismissals Act &ldquo;provides protection which, while not going as far as Deputy Rabbitte's amendment, is considerable&rdquo;. This is the nub of the test of any merit in this Bill. If someone does everything by the book and finds himself or herself without employment as a result, it is unconscionable that we should ask him or her to wait until the final process has worked its way out.</P>
      <P>It would be a contribution to the maintenance of industrial peace if someone who has fallen casualty to the conflict can at least deal with it on an unfair dismissals basis and allow the rest of the workers and the employer to make their peace under the terms of this Bill. It would be wise for the Minister of State to facilitate that. The one thing that will invite the solidarity of workers to engage in industrial action is if their colleague, leader or shop steward is sacked. If the individual who has probably organised the union is sacked and if there is not a remedy to deal with it outside what is prescribed for in this Bill, it will ensure solidarity among the rest of the workers and it will lead to fractures of the industrial peace, which the Minister of State does not want. I feel strongly about this issue. I do not want to be derisory about it but, as Deputy Bell remarked to me, it is a case of live horse and one will get grass. If we allow a situation where someone can be dismissed and we do not have redress other than what is envisaged in the Bill, then it is a bad day's work and it undermines the Bill's essence. I ask the Minister of State to rethink it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is aware of one aspect. The Unfair Dismissals Act links trade union activity during hours of work to the employers' permission to do so. The net effect of the amendment would be to render a dismissal unfair if it resulted from activities on behalf of a trade union during hours of work in circumstances in which the permission of the employer had been refused or had not been sought. I must be conscious of that aspect. The remedies open to an employee under the Unfair Dismissals Act are immediate. A victimised employee can seek redress outside the process of dealing with the claim before the Labour Court. I, therefore, urge the Deputy not to press the amendment until we see how the procedures operate in practice. I appreciate the Deputy must accept my word in good faith. Following a review, if there is not time in the lifetime of this Government to deal with this issue, I hope and presume that whoever is in this position, whether it is me or someone else &mdash;</P>

    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for placing patients' lives at risk by its failure to implement and reach the targets set in the 1996 national cancer strategy and particularly for its recent unprecedented failure to provide adequate services to deliver essential medical treatment and care to patients with cancer.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;approves the Government's continuing and sustained commitment to implementing the national cancer strategy and welcomes the significant investment which the Government has made in enhancing patient care and in improving cancer-related services generally.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;(Minister for Health and Children).</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
      <P>The Government has spent a lot of money on health services. Unfortunately, the statistics bear testimony to the appalling lack of effective health care for almost every section of the community. As always, those who are least able to afford health care are the ones who fall off the list. They either suffer on for months or years or die before they have the chance to receive treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a measure of the priorities of the Government that the proposed Stadium Ireland is given precedence over the treatment of patients in our hospitals. The argument is not about spending money on sport. The problem of Stadium Ireland is that it will allow vast expenditure for the benefit of developing a monument to a few with access <Col N="1472" /> being confined largely to the privileged to the exclusion of the most needy.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister attributed our ills to the legacy of the lifestyles of 25 years ago. While none of us will deny that lifestyle impacts significantly on quality of life and health status, it is true nevertheless that many cancers are unrelated to lifestyle, but may be genetically determined.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that one of my constituents is taking up a precious bed in a cancer treatment hospital. She is awaiting a bed in a rehabilitation unit which is unavailable. She does not want to be in a cancer treatment hospital as her treatment has been completed. She is, however, inadvertently denying another patient access to the bed in question and, possibly, life saving treatment. Surely this commentary on the general management of hospitals is a statement in itself. The lack of co-ordination of facilities within the public hospital sector must be addressed. It is not beyond the bounds of modern technology to identify places and vacancies and set priorities.</P>
    <P>While it would not be easy to put in place, a centralised unit, operated with the co-operation of consultants, general practitioners and hospital management, would help to alleviate what is an inefficient and incomprehensible waiting list system. It is bordering on the ludicrous when the situation I have described is allowed to persist and limited specialised treatment is being denied because of the inefficiency of the system. The Minister for Health and Children should appoint a health ombudsman on a similar basis to that of the Office of the Ombudsman. Public affairs are increasingly being scrutinised by bodies such as the Public Offices Commission and the Office of the Ombudsman's, but some of the biggest scandals are happening in the health service. There have been shocking cases where patients have been very poorly treated when at their most vulnerable. We should recognise that customer care, particularly for those most vulnerable, should be provided for effectively and that medical students should be adequately trained in dealing with their customers, the patients.</P>
    <P>There are many environmental factors linked to the increased risk of cancer, many of which we may not be able to reduce or eliminate. Radon gas is, however, one of the environmental factors about which we know, the level of which can easily be reduced within a dwelling. The cost involved is relatively small. Grant aid has been promised for a number of years. The purpose would be to allow residents to upgrade their homes to eliminate the risk from radon gas. It is unacceptable that the introduction of the grants scheme continues to be blocked. Many households across the country have been identified as having high levels of radon gas. Grants should be made available as soon as possible to enable these households to protect themselves.</P>
    <P>The area of palliative care is one that has been neglected and deserves a serious injection of funding. The excellent home care services and palliative care units of hospices seem to spend a <Col N="1473" /> great deal of time fund-raising. While this highlights the good work done by the organisation concerned, it is a shame that such a worthy and valuable service has to be propped up by voluntary fund-raising when there is a glut of money available to the Exchequer, although it is true that the Minister for Finance will hear the same argument from the many interest groups seeking additional funding. Both he and his colleagues in government have to decide priorities, but I make the case for additional funds for palliative care. Such units should not have to await reviews or reports. They provide an invaluable service for patients and their families when at their most vulnerable. They are quiet and hard-working and while they might not have the punch of the country's biggest hospitals, their needs should be prioritised.</P>
    <P>While the detection and treatment of cancer are complex and expensive, Ireland needs to keep pace with international best practice and new developments. For this reason, I urge the Minister to ensure cancer research is adequately funded. He must also ensure research funding is focused on substantial and relevant projects and that outcomes are measurable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Delay in access to diagnosis and treatment is at crisis level in much of the public health service, although funding for services should not be a problem in times of Exchequer plenty. In no aspect of health care is the delay more scandalous than in the detection and treatment of cancer. There are illnesses that will not become seriously worse or life-threatening if left untreated for a period of time. Cancer is not such an illness. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in combating it.</P>
      <P>We all are aware of the personal stories, many of which were recounted in the House last night, of patients who must wait months knowing how crucial is the time factor. Great strides have been made in detection and treatment with the result that cancer is not the fearful word it once was. It can and does take lives, however, the lives of one third of all those who do not survive beyond the age of 65 years. Those who visit their general practitioner with worrying symptoms are referred for specialist tests for which they have to wait, they have to await results and treatment &ndash; in some cases treatment sessions are repeatedly cancelled &ndash; and endure enormous anxiety, stress and pain when they know that time is of the essence. I reject the Minister's view that this is scaremongering. It is a real concern which needs to be addressed by the person in charge of the health service, that is, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all experienced cancer among our family or friends and know how vital it is that the national cancer strategy becomes a reality rather than an aspiration. I wish to address the area of screening, prevention and early detection. The organisers of BreastCheck have said that their screening programme can reduce the number of <Col N="1474" /> deaths from breast cancer by 20%. Screening for cervical and testicular cancer is known to be even more effective, both being preventable in the majority of cases if the signs are detected at an early stage.</P>
    <P>Plans were put in place for screening for breast and cervical cancer before the Government took office four years ago. Pilot health board regions were agreed and implementing personnel identified. Four years on, they are not yet fully operational in the pilot areas. The delay is extraordinary. Also, as my colleague, Deputy McManus indicated last night, if one does not live in a pilot area, one will have to wait a long time to be included in these life-saving programmes.</P>
    <P>There is a major concern which needs to be urgently addressed with regard to laboratory staff to carry out the tests central to the screening programme. Already patients have to wait months for results. The extra numbers that will come into the system through the screening programmes will exert serious pressure on an already overloaded system. I urge the Minister to address this issue. It is extremely urgent that extra staff are trained and put in place. Without testing within an acceptable timeframe, the screening programmes will not achieve the desired results. In the Limerick area, as I am sure in other areas, the provision of back-up staff is a major issue for specialists in cancer treatment.</P>
    <P>The delays and inadequacies of the service experienced by those who have cancer are shared, sadly, by thousands of others who expect to receive treatment when they need it. There are many areas identified by health board members and others working in system which have not been addressed. These include the shortage of beds, overstretched staff, the need for more back-up staff, and the fact that full use is not being made of operating theatres. There are many hours when theatres lie idle when they could be in use. The health service has to constantly deal with crisis management because of the situation in accident and emergency departments from where the numbers taking up hospital beds are huge. Many patients are occupying hospital beds when, as Deputy Upton indicated, they could be removed from the hospital system.</P>
    <P>All this is exerting huge pressure on the system and the Government, in spite of its inordinate wealth, is still not delivering quality care in this vital area after four years in office. The nation should not tolerate this.</P>

      <P>In the short time available to me, I want to focus on breast cancer and breast screening services. Every year, significant numbers of women are referred to breast clinics for <Col N="1475" /> diagnostic purposes, which referral, thankfully, establishes for many that no active disease is present. For others, the diagnosis of breast cancer can lead to protracted treatment and ongoing fear and anxiety. The mere fact of being referred to a clinic can raise fears and it is vital that no delays are experienced in obtaining appointments or being informed of the outcome of breast examinations.</P>
      <P>The Women's Health Council conducted a survey of the views and perceptions of women who attended symptomatic breast clinics. It found that the overwhelming majority of women discovered symptoms of breast disease through self-examination, after which they consulted a general practitioner. That finding surprised me as the 1994 ESRI report indicated that one in three women never conducted breast examinations. There is a need for a public information campaign to advise that breast health is an issue for women of all ages, not just post-menopausal women. Women must be vigilant about self-examination and at-risk groups must be identified, particularly women with a family history of breast cancer.</P>
      <P>In the period January to March 2001, approximately 2,700 women per month were screened at the BreastCheck units. Less than 1% of those screened since the commencement of the programme have been admitted to hospital for further management. It is important that this fact is highlighted in order that women do not, out of fear, avoid attending their general practitioner or being screened.</P>
      <P>The survey indicated that, by and large, women were satisfied with their treatment once they entered the clinical system. The top five care priorities highlighted in the survey were as follows: the first appointment should be within one week of referral; all diagnostic tests should be held in one session, where possible; any additional tests should be carried out within one week; unhurried time to talk to consultants on receiving test results; and continuity of care &ndash; if a second visit is required, an assurance should be given that a woman will see the same nurse and consultant. We must ensure these objectives are met.</P>
      <P>Forty of the women surveyed took the time to write open-ended comments on how they could have been better supported. Their comments distinguish clearly between the care received and the manner in which it was delivered. On page 53, table 31 of the survey, the following participant comments are outlined:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not to be left naked, waist up, for 30 minutes in a room with no heat . . .  Doctor then entered with a chart, no &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and asked me how my mastectomy went &ndash; I was in for a cyst, his patient was next door . . .  People entering the room as you were naked to speak with colleagues &ndash; doctor didn't make any introductions . . .  A man sat there but he was not introduced and I did not know who he was or why he was there . . .  Maybe more information <Col N="1476" /> could be provided . . .  The radiographer was not pleasant, did not say a lot about the mammogram . . .  Explain in more detail why the lump could not be removed &ndash; would it go itself? . . .  Explain why no further examinations would occur once the lump was not cancerous &ndash; could it become cancerous at any stage? . . .  As I was very nervous on my first visit, I would have welcomed some reassurance and being told a bit more about the procedures.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate on the motion has centred on the need for improved services in this area. There is always room for improvement. However, in addition to investment in health care provision, the staff who care for women coming forward for examinations must be trained to deliver services in an appropriate manner which is responsive to women's needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children on the actions he has taken in regard to cancer treatment services since his appointment. He has provided funding for research and invested heavily in centres of excellence throughout the country. In doing so, he has acknowledged a definite need to address treatable cancers such as breast and prostate cancer. I commend him on increasing funding for the national cancer strategy to £60 million and ensuring all the commitments outlined in the action plan are being implemented. I welcome the appointment of additional consultants in key areas of cancer treatment and research. There is a need for a greater number of awareness campaigns to encourage men and women to be screened on a more regular basis.</P>
      <P>St. Patrick's Hospice in Cork is to the fore in the provision of palliative care. Palliative medicine is an integral part of the health service and has, since 1995, been recognised as a unique medical specialty. Tremendous progress has been made in recent years in the area of hospice services and this will be further advanced by the launch of the document of the National Advisory Council on Palliative Care due to be published by the Department in the near future. This document will provide the framework to support the development of services in this area. Traditionally, palliative care focused on patients with cancer, but the focus has expanded in recent years beyond malignant conditions. Patients with non-malignant conditions are also accepted into palliative care if it is believed they would benefit from it. This shift in focus requires the skills of a multidisciplinary professional team to address the changing needs of patients and families alike. If necessary, support continues into the bereavement phase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The palliative care service works in tandem with established services in acute hospitals and the community. The role of general practitioners is central to the service's success as patients can be supported in their own homes. In 1991, the Southern Health Board, of which I am a member, was the first health board to appoint a palliative <Col N="1477" /> care physician and there are plans to appoint additional staff in the area. Marymount Hospice in Cork is the only specialist palliative unit in the health board region. The in-patient service comprises a 24 bed unit and the ward is staffed by specialist nurses, physiotherapists and a social worker. Together, these staff members provide multidisciplinary care for the patients. The day hospice provides further support for patients through the provision of diversional and complementary therapies. Some therapeutic intervention is also available to day patients, allowing them to maximise the time they spend at home with their families. The home care service based at Marymount serves both the city and county and up to 90 patients are cared for by the home care team at any one time. A specialist nurse was also recently appointed to co-ordinate the development of home care services in the north-south Kerry area.</P>
    <P>Other developments at Marymount in recent years include the establishment of an educational centre. The hospice provides ongoing education for professionals working within the region who wish to expand their knowledge in the area of palliative care. Patients benefit from best practice in their own local areas. The commitment to training and education includes links with the medical faculty in University College Cork which offers a degree in palliative nursing and postgraduate medical training.</P>
    <P>The history of St. Patrick's in Cork dates back to 1873 when the Sisters of Charity, who continue to make a major contribution in this area, first established a service. The service reflects the support of the statutory bodies and the Department of Health and Children and the tremendous voluntary contributions made by the Friends of St. Patrick's to improve services, particularly in lean times. The hospice receives assistance from a wonderful group of supporters and volunteers who give freely of their time to enhance the quality of the service provided. Many centres have modelled their facilities on St. Patrick's Hospice and Marymount Hospice. No family escapes the trauma of cancer. I thank the Friends of St. Patrick's for their dedication to the Sisters of Charity and patients of Marymount and St. Patrick's in Cork.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, a colleague of mine from Cork, will continue to provide the necessary funding to enhance and develop new facilities for the treatment of patients with cancer. I thank him for the funding which he and his predecessor, Deputy Cowen, have provided in this area in the past four years. I thank the Minister and the Government for the huge investment they have made in hospitals in the Cork region since 1997. A sum of £120 million has been spent on capital programmes to date. I am aware that my colleague, Deputy Dennehy, a member of the Southern Health Board, will have something to say on that issue. I support the amendment tabled in the name of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I join my colleague, Deputy O'Flynn, in complimenting my constituency colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, on his commitment and approach in dealing with all issues relating to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Cancer is, probably, the most frightening illness facing us and other European countries today. The statistics announced last week illustrate its seriousness and the potential that we may all suffer from one form of cancer or another. It does not discriminate between age, gender or lifestyles and we are always astonished when a friend or relative dies of it.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have suffered bereavements as a result of cancer will not think too highly of the motion before the House. I have argued many issues in the House since 1987 and accept that there must be give and take on all issues. However, other issues within the health service might have been selected for discussion. Cancer is the scourge of our time and something of which we are all afraid. We must discuss, analyse and face up to the issue in a more open and responsible fashion. It can be very frightening when the illness visits ones friends or family.</P>
      <P>It is very serious to suggest lives are being put at risk by a particular Government or Minister. Those of us who have witnessed the extra trauma endured by patients receiving treatment for cancer when machinery breaks down understand fully how distressed they and their families are. It is traumatic enough to be diagnosed as having cancer without having to face delays in receiving treatment. There has been a significant increase in the breakdown of machinery in the past ten years with the introduction of new technology, but the problem has decreased since the Government took office. One of the signatories to the motion would not fair too well if we were to look at the situation which prevailed when he was in office. That is very negative thinking.</P>
      <P>We must look at the issue in a broader context. One of the major decisions to be faced up to will be whether people want centres of excellence located in each town or in Dublin, Cork and Galway as recommended by the forum. We will need to look at the issue from the point of view of patients' needs rather than political expediency. It is a big challenge. It is easy for me to opt for accepting three centres of excellence because one of them will be located in Cork.</P>
      <P>There was a time when all heart operations had to be performed in the Mater Hospital, Dublin. We have moved on from that situation, but it has been a slow process. I ask people to be reasonable. Deputy O'Flynn outlined what is happening in the Southern Health Board area. People must face up to reality. Everyone is arguing their case. We had only one centre for heart operations initially, but branched out later.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children is adopting the right approach to the issue. He increased finance from £25 million to £60 million, but we are now finding that that will not be enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to support the Minister's amendment. Among the many welcome and innovative measures implemented by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and his predecessor, Deputy Cowen, was the decision to allocate £2 billion under the national development plan for capital investment, thus providing new nursing units for the elderly, hospital extensions and modern equipment.</P>
      <P>The Government has provided a new 30-bed nursing unit and community health facility in Ballyconnell while a new 50-bed nursing unit and community health facility is under construction in Virginia. The Minister has also committed substantial funding towards the provision of additional facilities at Cavan General Hospital. These are positive developments for which the Government has provided large-scale expenditure. This investment, in years to come, will contribute significantly to a much improved health service at local level in County Cavan.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's clear commitment to the implementation of the national cancer strategy. He is committed to the provision of the necessary resources in terms of infrastructure and personnel. The national cancer strategy and other fora have rightly identified the need to develop high quality cancer services throughout the country. Furthermore, it identified as a specific objective the need to provide access to equitable, effective, quality services throughout the regions. The Minister referred to the work of the sub-group of the National Cancer Forum in reviewing symptomatic breast disease services nationally. Alongside the national breast screening programme, there is a need for an equally excellent service for those with symptomatic breast disease. I welcome the Minister's commitment to the development of such a service. There is a need to reorganise and develop such services.</P>
      <P>In developing centres of excellence it is important that there is ready access to such services throughout the country. The report of the sub-group recommending one mammography service for the Northern Eastern Health Board in Drogheda is unacceptable. There is a need to provide such a service at Cavan General Hospital to ensure people throughout the whole region will have easy access to such services. I hope the Minister will give further consideration to this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a health board for the past 16 years, I have witnessed great progress in the delivery of health services to areas outside the main urban settings. I have welcomed <Col N="1480" /> the regionalisation of ENT and orthopaedic services. I welcomed, in particular, the publication of the national cancer strategy in 1996 by the rainbow coalition and the then Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan. I was particularly pleased that the Government continued that strategy. Its commitment to the implementation of the strategy is evident throughout the regions. One of the most effective decisions of the National Cancer Forum was the appointment of a regional director of cancer services within each health board.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has reappointed regional directors of cancer services to act under the chairmanship of Professor Paul Redmond on the second National Cancer Forum. One cannot stress enough the importance of such directors. Regional directors of cancer services should be supported in their key role of reorganising our cancer treatment services. Their only interests are to work to reduce the mortality rate from cancer and bring forward policies which will improve health status and quality of life.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Government's commitment to implementing the national cancer strategy in the Midland Health Board area was held up unnecessarily for 18 months because some members of the board would not, or could not, accept the advice of the independent regional director of cancer services, Professor Donal Hollywood. The real losers were the 1,100 patients who had to travel unnecessarily to Dublin for cancer treatment. Our support for the cancer strategy was challenged in the High Court. Thankfully, Mr. Justice Kearns held that the applicant for judicial review had forfeited that remedy by reason of delay and the non-disclosure of essential and relevant materials to the court in the <i>ex-parte </i>application.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that the judge vindicated my position, and that of the majority of members of the board, by stating that we had acted on independent medical advice and that we had no other motive. Unfortunately, while this wrangling was going on at health board level, and in the High Court, patients were suffering unnecessarily by having to travel for miles outside the region for treatment. I feel particularly for those who had to travel on public transport.</P>
      <P>People like me who supported the regional director and the National Cancer Forum were subjected to accusations of turning our backs on our local hospital. We were, and still are, vilified by some for not voting against the national strategy to deal with cancer. At all times we acted in the best interests of patient care and took the independent advice of the regional director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to debate the issue of the popular choice <i>vis-à-vis</i> the independent medical advice. I would have liked to have taken the easy and popular course of rejecting the advice of the independent regional director and Professor Jim Fennelly, then chairman of the National Cancer Forum. I could have gone the popular road by demanding the location of a service, in our case, the central chemotherapy unit, in Portlaoise <Col N="1481" /> rather than Tullamore. That would have been a vote getting exercise, but it would have done little for cancer patients and their families in counties Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath who still have to travel to Dublin for treatment.</P>
    <P>To reject the advice of the regional director would have meant no cancer service for the region. If a similar issue arises in other regions, I respectfully suggest that to reject independent medical advice must have a significant bearing on the level of commitment and services in the region. This was spelt out to us at our meeting with Professor Jim Fennelly and the National Cancer Forum. At the time the forum would not support the service for our region unless it was centrally located to provide services for patients in counties Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath. I wonder why the implications of rejecting the national cancer strategy were never examined by the local media and why Mr. Justice Kearns's findings received so little local coverage.</P>
    <P>During the debate which concerned the level of care for those who suffer from cancer, it was unfortunate that accusations were made such as the suggestion that Deputy Cowen, located as he was in Tullamore, and Minister for Health and Children at the time, had used undue influence in the decision regarding the location of the centre in Tullamore. Anyone with an interest in cancer services, and who had taken the time to read the national cancer strategy, would have known that Tullamore was selected under the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, whom I have applauded for introducing the strategy.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, all that is in the past and we now have a regional cancer service. I thank the Minister, Deputy Martin, for completing the cancer strategy for the midlands by allocating £500,000 to the health board as a first step towards its designation as the lead centre for breast cancer services. I urge him to take every opportunity to advise health board members on the important role of regional directors. Their overriding role is to reduce deaths from cancer. They have no ulterior motive in the location of cancer services, nor do they wish to have such a role.</P>
    <P>At all times we should support independent medical advice and take every opportunity to deliver on the commitments in the national cancer strategy. The location of services should never be decided on the accumulation of votes, but on the best way to reduce mortality rates and improve general health. Public representatives should at all times, even when under pressure, remember that the two principal objectives of the national cancer strategy are, first, to take all possible measures to reduce rates of illness and death from cancer, in line with the targets established by the Minister in Shaping a Healthier Future and, second, to ensure those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment in order that their quality of life is enhanced to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>Public representatives should remember these two guiding principles and support the Minister <Col N="1482" /> and the Government in delivering immediate strategies to fight the battle against cancer. This issue should not just be about the location of services, but how to deliver those services in the most effective way possible. Such a decision should be reached based on independent medical advice.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister, the Government and members of the Midland Health Board who have had the courage to recognise that this issue is about ensuring a better quality of life for those with cancer and providing the necessary supports for their families. That is the reason I reject the motion and support the Government's amendment. I know what this issue is about by way of ensuring funding is secured and delivered by the Government. I am proud that the Government has done so in the midlands and hope the strategy will work in the other seven health board regions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>As chairman of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, I am aware of the good work being done regarding cancer treatment in the region. I pay tribute to and salute those working in cancer services for their commitment and dedication to the provision of services for patients in such a professional and caring manner. This work is appreciated by all.</P>
      <P>This year the Eastern Regional Health Authority is spending an additional sum of over £9 million in developing cancer services in the region. This will mean that men, women and children who develop cancer will have access to more services, a broader range of services, more expert services and more high-tech treatments, where necessary.</P>
      <P>We all know how important it is to detect cancer at an early stage, because, frequently, the earlier it is picked up the better the long-term outcome. I am delighted that women in the ERHA region who fall into the at-risk category can now avail of a free mammogram aimed at detecting breast cancer at an early stage. I am optimistic that in the near future we will introduce a similar programme for men at risk of developing prostate cancer.</P>
      <P>Under the BreastCheck programme being piloted in two areas of the country, including the east, women in the 50 to 64 year age group are being given the opportunity to avail of a free mammogram. If a lump is detected, it is followed up at clinics in St. Vincent's and the Mater Hospitals. In other countries this type of programme has been shown to reduce deaths from breast cancer by between 20% and 30% through detecting the disease at an earlier stage. I hope this programme will result in a similar outcome here.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer is very common in Ireland. Approximately 1,600 new cases are diagnosed each year and, sadly, over 600 women die annually from the disease. Breast cancer is particularly tragic because it can hit women at an early age and it is our objective to reduce illness and death from this disease as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> The ERHA is spending an additional £1.5 million this year on treatment and developing services for women who have breast cancer. Following the recommendations of an expert working group, it has been decided to establish five centres of excellence for the treatment of breast cancer in Dublin located in St. Vincent's, the Mater, St. James's, Tallaght and Beaumont-James Connolly Hospitals.</P>
    <P>The ERHA is also placing a special emphasis on developing cervical screening, diagnostic and treatment services for those with leukaemia and palliative care services. Additional consultants are being appointed &ndash; eight in the specialty of haematology alone &ndash; to ensure those who develop cancer have access to top-class care.</P>
    <P>New drugs for the treatment of cancer are being constantly developed and we are in constant touch with cancer specialists to track these latest developments. The ERHA has allocated approximately an additional £2.5 million this year to provide patients with the latest drugs. Palliative care services are being extended and a new hospice will be provided in Blackrock. The services provided by Our Lady's Hospice and St. Francis's Hospice and the home care service continue to be developed. I pay tribute to St. Francis's Hospice and the home care service because they are located in my home patch and I am aware of their good work. The ERHA has made a submission to the working group on how radiotherapy services should be developed in the east. The group is examining this matter on a national basis and we are working towards the further development of these services.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in the development of diagnostic, treatment and rehabilitation services for those who develop cancer and we have pledged to do much more to fight this scourge. I commend and welcome the developments under the Minister for Health and Children and his departmental team. I condemn the manner in which the motion was tabled.</P>

      <P>It is sad that this motion is necessary given the record amount of money in coffers of the Department of Finance. However, people cannot get necessary treatment for all types of cancer. More than 80% of breast cancer cases occur in women over the age of 50 years and almost 10% of all women with breast cancer have a family history of the disease. I know women whose sisters died from breast cancer. They are aged over 50 years but they still have not been called for breast cancer screening. This is a dis<Col N="1484" /> grace and an outrage and something should be done about it immediately.</P>
      <P>Screening for breast cancer is offered in certain parts of the country. Phase one of the BreastCheck programme is available in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the North-Eastern and Midland Health Boards. Why can this facility not be extended nation-wide? What about the west and south of the country? All women should be treated equally in the prevention and treatment of this disease. In particular, women at risk should be offered this service regularly.</P>
      <P>Women from all sections of society in Mayo recently put together a massive campaign to maintain the breast clinic service in Mayo General Hospital. The possible withdrawal of the service created upset and disturbance. It also frightened many women who had been reassured that the service was available in Mayo. Why does central Government always take services away from remote parts of the country and relocate them in big city centre hospitals where the services providers cannot cope with them? Services in country hospitals should be utilised instead of relocating everything in Dublin and Galway. Some specialities should be located in rural areas such as Castlebar. Why must people always have to travel to cities? Why can city people not travel to rural areas?</P>
      <P>Most women health experts currently advise a three part programme regarding breast cancer screening and early detection. The programme should include an annual or bi-annual mammogram for women over the age of 40 years, yearly clinical breast examinations by doctors skilled in such examinations and monthly breast self-examination. These services should be available to women and they should be encouraged, given the high rate of breast cancer, to take all necessary precautions. This country has not always treated women equally. They have been let down by health services because they are women. However, at last, women are beginning to speak up and fight back. It is time women's health issues were taken seriously by the Government.</P>
      <P>Money should be spent on education and the prevention of cancer. The waiting lists with regard to prostate cancer are longer in Ireland than in most other developed countries. An awareness programme regarding prostate cancer is most necessary. The matter is not being treated seriously and the Government must put a programme in place. It should invest in advertising that will encourage men to take their health more seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Fianna Fáil Party Deputies from Cork and elsewhere have left because I wish to highlight three cases. The first involved a man in my constituency who was waiting for surgery for prostate cancer last year. He was called to Galway regional hospital seven times. Each morning he was due to be admitted, he received a telephone call from the hospital to tell him a bed was not available for him and he could not be admitted that day. I raised this matter in the <Col N="1485" /> House and the man was finally admitted on the seventh occasion. Is this a proper health service or proper cancer treatment? Does this case demonstrate that proper resources are being provided for people who are sick because this is the type of service that exists at present?</P>
    <P>The second case involved a man who was brought to Galway regional hospital. He was a single man and he remained at the hospital all day. He was to be admitted for surgery, but at 9 p.m. that night a neighbour received a telephone call asking that the man be collected. The man was collected at 11 p.m, but at 7 a.m. the following morning he was rushed back to the hospital because he became ill. He spent a number of months in hospital and he had surgery. This is the health service that some Deputies praised earlier. However, I do not consider that a proper health service.</P>
    <P>The third case involved a woman in her 60s who was waiting to be called to St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin. She was told she had cancer and she came to me, begging for a bed so she could receive treatment. Is this fair? Is that a good service? Is this morally right? Can the Minister imagine what went through that woman's mind and the minds of her family? She was told she had cancer and that she had to go to St. Luke's Hospital, but the hospital said no bed was available for her. That is not right. Does this demonstrate that cancer treatment services have the priority they deserve? Proper resources are not being provided and an increasing number of people are losing confidence. People who are diagnosed with cancer worry about where they will be treated and if they will have to approach their doctor or politicians and beg for a bed. This is not right.</P>
    <P>These cases involved people from my area and they demonstrate the health service that people experience at present. The cases highlight what is happening in the real world. Waiting lists are getting longer and the cry for beds is getting louder. There is no value for the money being spent on the health service. This is not right and the Minister for Health and Children and his Department must take responsibility for it. Something must be very wrong if resources are being provided but beds are still not available.</P>
    <P>Bowel cancer is also receiving much publicity, but people are shy to approach their doctors if they have a problem. The Government should do something about this matter and try to make it easier for people to be screened and, if necessary, treated. It is wrong that men, women and children who have been diagnosed with cancer are waiting for beds. I get annoyed when I hear my Fianna Fáil Party colleagues because the only thing the Government has been good at &ndash; it has cost the taxpayer much money &ndash; is public relations scams. I wish more members of the media were present in the gallery. Some of their colleagues are working for Departments and spinning messages, but the media should investigate what is happening in the real world. I am willing to bring <Col N="1486" /> them to Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar, the hospital in Galway or St. Luke's Hospital and show them cases involving sick people, some of whom are dying. People are looking for beds and services. They are sick and tired of the Government's stories about how well the economy is doing when they cannot get beds for parents, husbands, wives and children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this serious issue. Very few homes in Ireland have not been hit by cancer. My closest friend and cousin died 27 years ago of Hodgkin's disease, which is a form of cancer. Thankfully, today there is a cure for it. The first time he spoke to me about it and the first time he spoke about death was on the second night of Christmas when he told me that he expected to have four and a half to five years to live. It is a very difficult sentence.</P>
      <P>Shortly after I became a Member of this Dáil I visited a near neighbour and close friend in St. Luke's Hospital. He asked that no matter what else was done, funding should be made available to treat cancer and find cures. Although he came from a strong engineering background, he could not understand the reason he was often sent home because equipment was not working. He told me that if this happened in his contracting business, he would be expected to get or lease a new machine. Unfortunately, similar conditions prevail at times today. When Minister for Health my party leader made a major commitment to St. Luke's Hospital where significant improvements have been made.</P>
      <P>Mammograms are idle in some places. A previous speaker had kind words to say about Cavan General Hospital, but a machine at the hospital has been unused for two and a half years. I am sure Deputy Boylan will elaborate on this later. When we became involved with some of the women campaigning to get the machine into use they told us of the trauma suffered by those with breast cancer who had survived. They would not have suffered to such an extent had they been tested in time. In that context, I welcome the BreastCheck screening programme and encourage all women invited for screening to take up the offer. I regret that the screening service is not available nationwide, but, thankfully, it is in our area. I also regret that the medical manpower and infrastructure are unavailable to extend it to all. Many years ago friends of mine across the Border were saved by having such a check.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite these welcome developments there is no danger of us becoming dazzled by the success of the new screening system or overlooking the gross inadequacy of investment in the service for symptomatic breast disease. Women who present for breast screening under BreastCheck are guaranteed timeframes within which they will receive treatment should they require it. Despite the best efforts of the medical and nursing staff at breast disease clinics in many of the major hospitals, women who have breast disease symp<Col N="1487" /> toms can receive no such services. This is one of the biggest problems.</P>
    <P>The BreastCheck services show what can be done with proper resources. The long queues at the under-resourced out-patient breast clinics at the major hospitals tell a different story. This under-resourcing is a scandal. The Minister has proudly said that since the Government took office there has been a 70% increase in the health budget. Why can funding not be used to the benefit of this service?</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Ring, I can highlight cases in my county hospital, Monaghan General Hospital. It could do much more to help patients at the outset if funding was made available. As it is they have been pushed down the list or sent to Dublin for different surgery. This applies especially in the case of prostate gland treatment. I recently made a request to the Meath and Adelaide Hospitals at Tallaght to explain the reason a patient was not being called for treatment. A doctor wrote to me saying that he would love to do more, but unlike the old situation at the Meath Hospital, where he had 50 beds available, he now has only 30. I tabled a question on the matter to the Minister. In his reply of yesterday he stated that responsibility for the provision of neurological services at the Meath Hospital rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority services. He went on to say that his Department had asked the regional chief executive to provide more information. The hospital provides a national service on which patients in County Monaghan depend. Proper facilities are needed. If it was seen fit to close the Meath Hospital and incorporate it in a bigger hospital, surely at least the same, if not better, services should be available. Those living in rural and peripheral areas suffer the most. I hope the massive sums being made available to the Minister will be used in a more proactive manner as far as cancer is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Gay Mitchell on moving the motion. Cancer treatment and services touch all families and cross all classes. None of us can be sure that we will escape it, whether personally or through family contacts. It strikes to the heart of all and has devastated many families, unnecessarily so in many cases. I am aware of three cases involving relatively young women in their forties who died from breast cancer. Tragically, they left families behind them. In many instances, similar tragedies could be avoided if there was proper care and screening services. In many cases, especially those involving breast cancer, treatment is successful if the disease is detected in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I raised the issue of the BreastCheck service in the House a number of months ago the Minister said he hoped it would be available nationwide by the end of the year. Living as I do in the Southern Health Board region I hope that will happen. While I am aware of the obstacles, especially regarding the establishment of a data<Col N="1488" /> base to contact all women in the relevant age brackets, the extension of the service is both necessary and welcome.</P>
    <P>The severe lack of funding for symptomatic breast services has been referred to. The report of the subgroup of the National Cancer Forum published last year recommended the establishment of a number of symptomatic breast cancer services nationwide. I welcome the report. If it is implemented, it will mean that surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, medical oncologists, radiotherapists plastic surgeons, nurses and counsellors will all operate in the one multidisciplinary setting. This is seen as the best way to treat breast cancer and provide the best services for women. An excellent service in Cork at the South Infirmary Hospital, which is due to be expanded, and a facility at Cork University Hospital serve the Southern Health Board region. The expansion of the service is long overdue and I hope the necessary funding will be provided.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the level of funding &ndash; £4.35 million nationally &ndash; the Minister has provided this year towards the development of such services. A sum of £800,000 will be allocated to the Southern Health Board region. That is to include infrastructure, consultant appointments and the deployment of the necessary equipment. It is very little in the context of the life saving service to be provided. The national cancer forum recommends that counselling services be provided to relatives and the families of the person who is sick, although the person might not necessarily be terminally ill. Cancer strikes every family; it can be a strain on families. They need support, counselling and taxi fares to and from the hospital. These are basic elements of the service that should be provided.</P>
    <P>There is a report on this issue but it needs to be developed further if we are to support family members who can, in turn, support the patient in such a tragic situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for tabling this important motion. Cancer has a major impact on the health of the Irish population. One in three people will develop cancer during their lifetime. Cancer causes one in four deaths each year so it places a formidable burden, both physical and psychological, on society.</P>
      <P>There is a huge need to devote finance to both the prevention and treatment of cancer. We must redouble our efforts to reduce the level of smoking, to increase people's participation in physical activities and to promote a healthy diet. It is important that we increase consumption of fruit and vegetables. The health promotion campaign should be accelerated considerably through the media and through the Government's health strategy. The backbone of that strategy should be the promotion of health care and public health concerns. That is a huge area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to treatment, the priority is to ensure that patients are treated at the level of <Col N="1489" /> best practice internationally. That is not the case at present. One way of ensuring the highest possible standards of care is to increase the participation rate in national and international random control trials of cancer therapies. Why is that not happening? The health boards and hospitals need resources to support cancer specialists in their participation in large randomised trials. The Minister should report to me on this point because it is not happening at present.</P>
    <P>Best practice in cancer care means patients should be treated in dedicated centres of excellence. That is not happening despite the amount of money available for the health services. These centres should have the facilities to ensure that patients receive care that is comparable to the best in the world. What is needed is a coherent strategy which addresses both the prevention and treatment of cancer. I am astonished that, despite the billions available to the health services, the north west does not have a dedicated service in Sligo regional hospital. I call on the Minister to examine the possibility of locating such a service in Sligo.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the hospice in Sligo on its outstanding work. A considerable amount of money is given voluntarily to the hospice but there is also massive fund raising. However, a dedicated unit is now required so patients will be guaranteed they will receive care that is comparable with the best in the world. That is not happening. It is not an issue of spending billions but of effective management. That is where the problem lies. The country never had so much money to spend but questions must be answered with regard to the management of money within the health services.</P>
    <P>In the new millennium the people of the north west should be entitled to the same service and specialised care as is available to people on the east coast. There should also be randomised trials and best international practice. The lack of them should be an embarrassment to the Minister for Health and Children. This is a most important issue. One in four people in this country die of cancer. The incidence of cancer has a huge impact on every family.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Mitchell's outstanding document on health. It will be the backbone of Fine Gael policy in Government. We will have a coherent strategy which will address both the prevention and treatment of cancer. It will be the priority of Fine Gael and, when my colleague is Minister for Health in the not too distant future, I will be delighted to work with him in implementing that strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Gay Mitchell on bringing this motion before the House. My concern is not only for the Government's lack of strategy but also its lack of commitment to the provision of an adequate service for children suffering from cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five minutes drive from here is a monument to this Government's neglect. The facilities of Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, which caters for chil<Col N="1490" /> dren throughout the country who are suffering from cancer, are an edifice of neglect, especially at a time when money is so plentiful we do not know what to do with it. I challenge the Minister of State and the Minister, if they have not already done so, to leave the comfort and protection of this House and face reality with a visit to St. John's ward, the oncology ward, of Our Lady's Hospital. They will there witness something they can no longer choose to ignore. Consultants, doctors and nursing staff have over the years, to provide a service for the children suffering from cancer, been obliged to beg on the streets and do everything possible to encourage the public to provide money voluntarily for a service which the Government should be providing.</P>
    <P>The Government has neglected that hospital and as long as that neglect continues, the Minister cannot credibly claim to be delivering a service that is adequate for the people in need. I have spent six years visiting that hospital for personal reasons. I have seen the neglect and what is required in the hospital. If the Minister does not react, within whatever lifetime remains to this Govenment, to that hospital's need, he must be callous towards the suffering of young children. If the Minister walked through St. John's ward this evening, he would certainly be moved by the suffering not only of the children but of the parents and families who are trying to comfort them.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be a response to my plea. This is the national hospital for treating children with cancer and it cannot be neglected, regardless of what other commitments the Minister might have for political reasons. It was sad to listen last night to Government backbenchers congratulating this Minister and Minister of State on their work. It is a disgrace. I do not believe they realised what they were saying. Their commitment is only shoddy, at best.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister of State realise that a person from the west of Ireland who travels to St. Luke's Hospital for treatment must stay in a bed and breakfast? Can the Minister of State, as a professional doctor, not understand that it is time to stop this practice? People suffering from cancer are under huge stress without forcing them to stay in a bed and breakfast. That is not the Ireland of which I wish to be part. I cannot condone a Government and Minister who stand idly by and do nothing in those situations.</P>

      <P>Last night the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, drew attention to the wide-ranging efforts which have been made in dealing with the implementation of the national cancer strategy in a structured and comprehensive manner. This has involved re-organising cancer treatment services to promote a strong patient focus and ensure equity of access throughout the country, devoting resources to screening and early detection programmes of proven value, including the establishment of national programmes of screening for <Col N="1491" /> breast and cervical cancer, using health promotion activities to emphasise further the importance of healthy lifestyles, developing specialist palliative care services and facilitating greater co-ordination of cancer research.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I used to work there and know a little bit about it. The national cancer strategy derives from the original health strategy of 1994, Shaping a Healthier Future, and particular efforts have been made to ensure a high level of consultation and inclusiveness in the implementation of the strategy at national level through the National Cancer Forum and at regional level through the appointment of regional directors of cancer services.</P>
      <P>The strategy is aimed at developing centres of excellence and concentrated expertise to ensure a critical mass for multi-disciplinary expert service provision. At the same time the strategy has aimed to bring services closer to patients' homes to ensure equity of access while ensuring that a high quality service is offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the general implementation of the national cancer strategy as evidenced by the appointment of qualified consultant staff in the fields of medical oncology and haematology among others, 55 of which have been appointed to date, I am especially glad to note the care and attention which has gone into the development of national screening programmes in the areas of breast screening and cervical screening. These programmes have been developed on the basis of the best evidence available and have been tar<Col N="1492" /> geted at pilot populations to ensure that optimum detection rates are achieved and quality services developed. It is intended to develop such screening services at national level based on the evaluation of the results achieved so far in these programmes.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the techniques used in screening for cancer are proved to be medically effective and accurate before screening programmes covering large segments of the population are introduced. The question of introducing screening programmes for other forms of cancer is being kept under review and is being considered by the National Cancer Forum under the chairmanship of Professor Paul Redmond. The forum has established a working group on cancer screening which will examine all relevant issues relating to the introduction of cancer screening programmes. The forum will keep the Minister advised on these matters.</P>
    <P>While significant progress has been made in implementing the national cancer strategy since 1997, discussions with health boards have identified a range of additional needs which have not been provided for in the strategy or the action plan. These needs have arisen mainly in the areas of surgery, radiotherapy, cancer nurses, drug costs and palliative care. It is clear that these and other areas will require further examination as the regional directors develop their regional cancer plans further.</P>
    <P>In addition, funding has been provided which will be targeted at counselling and support services and nurse education. Projects will also be funded under the tripartite memorandum of understanding between the National Cancer Institute in the USA, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, including the production of an all-Ireland cancer report being compiled jointly by the cancer registries here and in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the area of cancer treatment and care is one of the most complex and difficult areas which our modern health service has tackled. It is an area which requires a multi-disciplinary approach and the development of services must take into account the needs of patients and their families. The Government has demonstrated that it is committed not just to once-off investment but to an incremental and targeted investment policy based on the best professional advice available which is intended to achieve the best international standards of care. I support the amendment to the motion.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Hayes and Gay Mitchell. This is one of the most important debates we will have this term, and I thank our spokesman, Deputy Gay Mitchell, for bringing it forward. We will be judged on our response to this debate. Many individuals and families will be watching to see our response, and they will be extremely disappointed by the Minister of State's response to the issues <Col N="1493" /> raised and brought to his attention within the past five minutes and which he has sought to ignore.</P>
      <P>The health services are in a shambles, but we are focusing in this debate on cancer treatment and the care of cancer patients. Both are close to non-existent. They are not available. Early detection and immediate treatment will bring results. We read in the daily papers and medical journals of the great advances made in medical science in the treatment of cancer. It is important people have regular screening, especially women.</P>
      <P>In that regard, the response of the Minister of State and of the Minister, Deputy Martin, to the early diagnosis of treatment within the North-Eastern Health Board area is as follows. A mammography machine was purchased by the Friends of Cavan General Hospital, brought to the hospital and lay for two years in the crates in which it was packed, despite the fact the same good people raised funds for its commission. It has not been commissioned although we were promised it would happen. One of the largest public meetings on this issue was organised by councillors Madeleine Argue and Maura Maguire Lynch and others in Cavan Town Hall and was supported by the men and women of County Monaghan. It is not often the people of Cavan and Monaghan come together, but there is an understanding on this issue that there cannot be screening equipment in every general hospital in the country and that it must be done on a regional basis. Cavan General Hospital is an ideal location for a mammography machine for that region. The response of the Minister, Deputy Martin, the Minister of State and the Department of Health and Children has been&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is responding to me and I will respond to him because this is an issue for which he is responsible. The decision of the Minister is that this machine will be placed in Drogheda. It is very difficult for people to travel to or from that hospital. Everything must be on the east coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that move will not happen because I have given a public commitment that this mammography machine will be commissioned in Cavan General Hospital by Fine Gael in the next Government. That undertaking was given by <Col N="1494" /> Deputy John Bruton, our former leader, and our current leader has also agreed to honour it. It will happen, but it is unfortunate that we must wait another three to six months before it happens. Time is important and it is also important to have early detection and immediate treatment. Marvellous results could be but are not being obtained.</P>

      <P>It is frightening, unacceptable and not good enough and the people will not put up with it. If the Government cannot deliver health services to the people, it is not delivering as a Government. Will the Minister of State admit that the Government is incapable of managing the health services? I am not convinced the problem is only due to a lack of funding. It is also due to a lack of good management. The Government is not managing the country. It is failing to manage the health services and people are suffering. I am not making up fairy tales. I can stand over every claim I have made. I invite the Minister to visit Cavan General Hospital to see for himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are Ministers who are paid huge sums of money and given responsibility for a service by this House not responsible? In his reply Deputy Moffatt made more than 16 references to reports. The Taoiseach gives the same blather every day during the debate on the Order of Business. We heard from him again today about report upon report.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister of State that the issue is not one of money. For some bizarre reason we have decided that we must have a local health authority responsible purely to its own health board. This is nonsense. Our population is less than that of Manchester which has one health service, but we have built bureaucracy upon administration and our increasing expenditure gets lost as a result. Deputy Crawford got to the nub of the issue when he said he is tired of getting letters from the Minister for Health and Children telling him the chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority is responsible for the matter in question. When will politicians take responsibility for the expenditure of the money we vote in this House? The Minister of State failed to grasp this issue in his response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the BreastCheck programme which has been put in place for women throughout the <Col N="1495" /> country. However, why is the same emphasis not put on dealing with testicular and prostate cancer? These are important issues. No equivalent screening programme has been established for these conditions.</P>

There is a health promotion unit in the Department of Health and Children but we do not place the same emphasis on screening for cancers among men. This issue must be addressed and I encourage the Government to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who contributed to the debate. I am particularly grateful to Deputy Ulick Burke who addressed the issue of Crumlin hospital, which is in my constituency. I could not have made the case more eloquently myself. Had I done so I would have been accused of special pleading. What Deputy Burke said about Crumlin hospital is absolutely correct. It is time to invest in the hospital which has not been given the long-term financial commitment it deserves. The hospital was built almost half a century ago and needs a major upgrade.</P>
      <P>I spoke last evening about the difference in the life expectancy enjoyed by the populations of France and Ireland. I do not understand why four million French people collectively live 13 million years longer than the Irish population will. One would imagine that we, an island people who are supposed to be relaxed, would live longer than the French. Why do we accept the fact that our neighbours live longer than we do?</P>
      <P>Because more young French women have begun to smoke, it can now be predicted that 25 years from now the cancer rate among women in France will have significantly increased. In Ireland there has been a decrease in the use of tobacco from 47% to 25%. However, within those figures there are significantly high numbers of young people, and young women in particular, who are smoking. Tobacco companies are putting tastes into their products in order to attract and addict young people to them. We do nothing about this. We can predict that, 25 years from now these young people will present with cancer, unless we take steps to stop them.</P>
      <P>If individual states in the United States can receive $347 billion as a settlement from the tobacco industry, simply for the health costs they had to incur because of the damage done by tobacco to the health of the citizens, we should receive £6 billion. Legal advice available to me is that this case is waiting to be heard. The Minister should take legal advice, sue the tobacco companies and use the money he wins to drive down the levels of cancer in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> The dangers of drinking and smoking and their implications for cancer are very serious. I like a pint but I do not smoke and when I go into a public house I do not like having to smoke someone else's tobacco. I spoke last evening about passive smoking and its carcinogenic effect. I will facilitate the speedy passage of legislation to stop smoking in public houses except in designated smoking sections, so that the rest of us do not have to inhale the cancerous and addictive product. I ask the Minister to require public houses to have proper systems of ventilation and air extraction so that people can enjoy a drink without being open to the danger of cancer.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister said he had made several million pounds available for this and that element of the health service. If the Minister had made those amounts of money available he would be summoned to a tribunal of inquiry. As far as I know the Minister does not have that sort of money and he is not the sort of person to hold an off-shore bank account. We made the money available. Dáil Éireann took that money from the people and entrusted unprecedented amounts of it to the Minister. The Minister has been given the biggest amount of money any Minister for Health has ever been given to spend on the health service and he still cannot do the job. This is called incompetence. The Minister tells the Members of the House, who take the money from the people and entrust it to him, what he is doing in providing extra money. The Minister did not provide an extra brass farthing. We provided the money and we are entitled to expect greater accountability. In his tenure of office in the Department of Health and Children we expect the Minister to learn from the mess he left in the Department of Education and Science. The Minister clearly does not understand the problem of the health service.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not wish to answer the question I tabled last March regarding the number of reviews, committees, inquiries, commissions and standing committees established by him. If I were the Minister I too would be ashamed to answer it.</P>

    <P>The Government has failed to give priority to ser<Col N="1498" /> vices which could help more to survive cancer.

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I outlined in considerable detail the reason I feel so strongly about this amendment. I am equally strongly persuaded by the Minister of State that no matter what I say, he will not take it on board. That is a great pity because, in many ways, this matter is at the heart of the Bill and to say that the person concerned has recourse in the normal way to the Unfair Dismissals Act does not address the situation, but I accept that I have, probably, taken the matter as far as I can.</P>

        <b>: </b>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 34 and 35.</P>
      <P>I will not labour the points which, with related points, I have made repeatedly and to which the Minister of State has repeatedly turned a deaf ear and invoked the Constitution, a favourite tactic not only of the Minister of State, but his party leader, the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern. Whether it is ground rents, controlling speculation on building land or whatever, the Constitution is marched out to do battle when in reality it is vested interests which are standing in the way of progress in regard to all these matters.</P>
      <P>The amendments I have put forward are such that they would delete the idea that an employer could not be compelled to enter into arrangements for collective bargaining. The Minister of State will again use the Constitution, the Abbot and Whelan judgment and so forth against me. That is wrong. Perhaps he could briefly explain to me the reason an employer cannot be compelled to engage in collective bargaining, but can be compelled to have a determination from the machinery of the legislation implemented. What is the difference between the two concepts?</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the Bill seems to have emerged from a process of what the Minister of State describes as agreement between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and employers. Frankly, it shows how far the leadership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has moved from its roots and the real conflict at the ground floor of the labour, trade union and working class movement where workers still face, on a day-to-day basis, the problems that rampant capitalism throws up in the form of employers on the fast track to as much profit as they can gain, and the employees are the victims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments have been well rehearsed in relation to the whole question of collective bargaining. I remind the Deputy that the legal advice is that, in preparing the Bill, various approaches were considered and that the legal advice was not definitive as to whether legislation requiring an employer to give recognition to a particular trade union would be constitutional. The question was not pursued at the high level group, however, and it has formulated an approach which gives primacy to the importance of a voluntarist approach to collective bargaining. That is the position. A voluntarist approach was pursued by the ICTU and IBEC and it is necessary to retain section 5(2) in order to implement the approach agreed by them. That approach focuses on providing the parties with adjudication machinery on pay and conditions of employment. The legislation is focused on a particular situation and at the risk of sounding repetitive, I will not accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 11 to 20.</P>
      <P>We touched on this issue in the context of the discussion on the proposed excision of paragraph (<i>d</i>) of section 2. The Minister of State drew our attention to section 8, specifically subsections (2) and (3), by way of arguing that it would meet the concerns being expressed under section 2. I am still not able to fully grasp the connection. It appears that the Bill would still be better without this section, from a trade union point of view, because it pulls the rug out from under the trade union for the slightest fracture of industrial peace.</P>
      <P>Perhaps my colleague, Deputy Bell, understands it, but I am at a loss to understand the connection between sections 2 and 8 that the Minister of State posited. Section 2, as I understand it, might be termed a series of preconditions for intervention by the Labour Court. Section 8 has nothing to do with preconditions. It is about the process already in train. The sections are quite different. If I am reading this incorrectly, I will be happy to be told about it, but section 8, contrary to section 2, states: &ldquo;Subject to <i>subsection (2),</i> the Court shall cease its investigation . . . &rdquo;  That implies that the court is investigating. It should be remembered that for the court to embark on the investigation in the first place it has to meet all the preconditions in section 2. I ask the Minister of State to explain the connection to me.</P>
      <P>Section 8(1) also states &ldquo;the Court shall cease its investigation&rdquo; and, furthermore, &ldquo;the Court shall withdraw any recommendation&rdquo; if it has the slightest belief that any fracture of industrial peace occurred. I repudiate that kind of thinking, both in itself and in terms of the link the Minister of State is making between sections 2 and 8. I cannot follow his thinking in regard to the latter, namely, that after the hurdles of preconditions have been cleared to allow the court to carry out an investigation or a review, if anybody brings to its attention that any form of industrial action took place, the court can call off its investigation or can withdraw its recommendation if it has issued one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State will say that subsection (2) qualifies the position. Perhaps it does to a certain extent. I am not referring here to the link to section 2 because I cannot see how it qualifies that section. I accept it may qualify section 8(1) to some extent, although I am curious about the use of the term &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo;. I would have thought the subsection should state &ldquo;notwithstanding subsection (1) <Col N="1502" /> above&rdquo;, but it does not. The term &ldquo;the Court is satisfied by a trade union&rdquo; is also used in section 8(2). In a situation where a trade union goes before the court and enters a plea to the effect that the industrial action was not too serious in nature, that it would be far more serious to have regard to that clause or it would be more sensible to proceed to a finding or a determination, the Minister of State seems to be saying that subsection (2) can be invoked in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated that subsection (2) qualifies subsection (1) and the court, having been persuaded by the trade union, may proceed with its investigation. However, the subsection does not state that the court shall not withdraw its recommendation. The power to make such a withdrawal, which is dealt with in subsection (1), appears to be retained. I understand from where the Minister of State is coming on this matter. He is stating that we do not want any more Ryanair type problems &ndash; that was an embarrassing moment for everybody concerned &ndash; and that his overriding concern is industrial peace. Many Members would subscribe to that view. However, it is counterproductive to be so prescriptive, to insist on all of these hurdles being put in place and to advocate a belt and braces provision which states that if there is the slightest inkling that there had been industrial action in relation to the subject matter of a dispute, the recommendation will be withdrawn or, if it is still in train, the investigation shall cease. I do not see the point of this provision.</P>
    <P>I see the merit of a clause to give the court discretion in terms of whether it should proceed. The Minister of State will have to persuade me on this matter. There may be a simple connection between sections 2 and 8, but I do not see it.</P>

      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I hope the Minister listened carefully to what Deputy Rabbitte said and I ask him to listen in the same manner to what I am about to say. I rehearsed my arguments on this matter earlier in respect of the amendment we tabled in respect of section 2(1)(<i>d</i>). The Minister of State did not reply convincingly or logically on that occasion. He must clarify the position now, because this is a critical issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State insisted that section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) should remain in the Bill and he was successful in that regard. I read that section as saying that if industrial action had taken place after an employer had failed to observe a provision of the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution, the court would be precluded from using the machinery provided in this legislation. The Minister of State indicated that section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) is modified by section 8, which is the nub of the problem. My understanding is that section 8(2) refers specifically to a situation where the machinery has already come into play. I invite the Minister of State to read section 8(2) which states &ldquo;If, having regard to all the circumstances, the Court is satisfied by a trade union or excepted body that it is reasonable to proceed with its <Col N="1503" /> investigation or review under <i>section 6,</i> it shall so proceed.&rdquo;  Section 6(1) states &ldquo;Where, in the opinion of the Court, a dispute that is the subject of a recommendation under section 5 has not been resolved, the Court may, at the request of a trade union or excepted body and following a review of all relevant matters, make a determination.&rdquo;  It is quite clear from this, that the process will already be well under way.</P>
    <P>In turn, section 6 reverts to section 5, subsection (1) of which states &ldquo;The Court, having investigated a trade dispute under <i>section 2,</i> may make a recommendation giving its opinion in the matter and, where appropriate, its view as to the action that should be taken having regard to terms and conditions of employment, and to dispute resolution and disciplinary procedures, in the employment concerned.&rdquo;  Section 8(2) only reaches back as far as section 6 and, at the limit, section 5 and does not refer back to the beginning of the process where four conditions are laid down are laid down, under which the court may intervene. If those conditions are met, the court may hear the complaint. If either or all of them have not been met, the court may not do so.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to reply with clarity on my contention that section 8(2) does not make good a problem which might arise under section 2(1)(<i>d</i>). My original amendment was designed to delete section 8 because I was opposed to the idea that the court should be compelled to cease its investigation if industrial action had occurred. That is completely unreasonable, particularly in terms of the way disputes develop in workplaces. In a sense, it is probably better that section 8 is retained in the Bill because what the Minister of State says in reply either will or will not be borne out in the courts. We will have an opportunity to witness what happens in that regard. Before the legislation is placed on the Statute Book, the Minister of State must reply to the serious points that have been raised.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 8(1), I am amazed the leadership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions would agree to such a provision. How far has it come from the coal face of labour relations and the situation in numerous workplaces in the State? How far is it removed from what happens on a weekly and daily basis when certain elements of management or management as a whole campaign against trade union activists and workers who speak up, give leadership in their workplace, are not prepared to take abuse or allow themselves or their fellow workers to be put upon and will fight back? How far has it come from an understanding of the situation where employers take provocative action on a continual basis in some employments and workers must resort to industrial action and lightening strikes because that is the only weapon they have to defend themselves and bring a greater force to bear on the employer rather than waiting for the legislation where finality may come in 18 months, but where, in many cases, it may be longer?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> I ask the Minister of State to clarify section 8(2). To what precisely does it refer? What precisely does it qualify? Are we correct in saying that if section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) disqualifies an intervention by the Labour Court, section 8(2) will be too late to save it? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to my socialist colleagues argue the point about section 8, one aspect strikes me. Earlier in the debate we dealt with section 2 which provides for the Labour Court to investigate a trade dispute provided certain criteria are met. These criteria are outlined in the legislation. There was a problem with one aspect of those criteria, namely, section 2(1)(<i>d</i>). There was a proposal to amend section 2 to delete all reference to paragraph (<i>d</i>), but that failed. Section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) has been reaffirmed by the House and will be incorporated in the legislation. Section 8 affords a certain amount of discretion to the Labour Court which will allow it to follow a procedure where it is considered reasonable to do so, as outlined in subsection (2) which states that &ldquo;it is reasonable to proceed with its investigation&rdquo;. I accept the clarification both Deputies seek on whether this will happen after the procedure has commenced. It appears that it would be appropriate to only delete section 8 if the application to delete section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) had been successful.</P>

      <P>There is not much point deleting section 8 given that the House has already ratified the incorporation of section 2(1)(<i>d</i>). In the circumstances in which we now find ourselves, it may be the best of a bad job to leave section 8 as it is and not proceed with the deletion of section 8, as Deputies Rabbitte and Joe Higgins said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) governs the requirement that there be industrial peace at the time of referral of the dispute. Section 8(2) covers a time period which starts when the case is referred to the Labour Court and ends when a determination is issued under section 6. Section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) requires that industrial peace prevail at the time of referral, whereas section 8(2) requires that peace prevail throughout the process between section 2 and section 6. Deputy Flanagan is right. Perhaps I made the connection between the two sections a bit tighter than it is, but the essence is that the Labour Court has discretion. The amendment would give the Labour Court discretion as to whether it should continue its investigation when industrial action is provoked. Perhaps I gave the impression of a closer link between the two sections. The system has been agreed by the ICTU and IBEC. I cannot accept the amendment to delete lines 11 to 20.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is difficult enough to deal with at the best of times, but this is a horse of a different colour. When we debated <Col N="1505" /> section 2(1)(<i>d</i>), the Minister of State said that we were missing a point and drew our attention to section 8 which he said would be all right as soon as we got to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State wanted us to agree to section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) and said that we would get our reward in section 8. It is a great style. I envy the Minister of State for getting away with it, but it is not playing the game according to the rules. It is clear that section 8 does not have any connection with section 2, let alone a weaker link as the Minister of State said. One cannot get as far as an investigation unless it is obvious that one conforms to section 2(1)(<i>d</i>). I agree with Deputy Flanagan that since that is the bind we are in, we would only worsen the situation by excising subsections (2) and (3) now. I wonder what would be the impact of excising section 8(1), (2) and (3). It would, probably, make a marginal improvement, but it, probably, is much of a muchness in so far as the discretion is with the Labour Court in terms of the exercise of its powers under subsection (1). I presume good sense would apply. We would be better off without section 8 in its entirety. Subsection (2) offers some prospect of relief in a reasonable situation or in a situation where a reasonable case can be made to the Labour Court that, notwithstanding anything outlined, it should proceed. The Labour Court would be minded to so proceed in a majority of cases if a reasonable case was set out for it. I am sure the Minister of State did not do it deliberately, but he talked us into section 2 in the belief we were getting relief later, which is not the case. One can only either condemn or admire this. Given the hour of the night, I admire it.</P>

        <b>:</b> We are now in an extraordinary situation because the Minister of State did not just make a little connection between section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) and section 8. The Minister of State argued strongly that we should allow section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) because he categorically said that it was modified by section 8. The Minister of State gave the impression to the Dáil that section 8 would rectify any problems that might arise under section 2(1)(<i>d</i>). Now that we have arrived at section 8, the Minister of State says it was not quite like that. Section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) is a done deal and section 8 has nothing to do with it, the Minister of State now claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State must right this situation. He got the Dáil to vote with him on section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) on the basis of what he said in the House. What he said was incorrect. I suggest that the Minister of State, with the help of the able <Col N="1506" /> officials present in the House, bring in an amendment on his feet as he has the power to do. That amendment should qualify section 2(1)(d) which the Dáil has passed on the Minister of State's recommendation because Members were told that the section would be modified by section 8. I invite the Minister of State to make good what he said earlier, which was that section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) could be the subject of the discretion which section 8(2) gives in regard to a later stage of the process. It should only take a line or two of print to do that, but the Minister of State must do it now to ensure that what was said earlier did not prejudice&mdash;-</P>

      <P>I am looking at the notes of what I said earlier and it is accurate. I said that I have given the court discretion as to whether to proceed with an investigation where industrial action occurs during the statutory process. One of my comments during the debate on section 2 was that section 8 as it now stands, following Committee Stage, gives the court discretion to proceed with an investigation where it has been satisfied by a trade union or excepted body that it would be reasonable to do so, having regard to all the circumstances of the dispute. That is the position.</P>
      <P>Section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) specifies that the court shall not investigate a dispute where industrial action has taken place before the case came to the court. Section 8(2) specifies that industrial peace must prevail in the period between the court beginning its investigation and its ending with the issue of a determination under section 6. However, that position which I outlined earlier is accurate.</P>

      <P>I have not ever been in this situation before. I do not know how we proceed. The Minister of State has read a note into the record. I am sure it is the same note that he read earlier but Members know that in the debate that took place on section 2(1)(<i>d</i>), the Minister of State said we should bide our time as everything would be sorted out when we got to section 8. He elaborated on that thesis. The entire basis of his submission &ndash; and the record of the House will show this &ndash; was that by the time we got to section 8, we would see that the discretion that Members sought in relation to section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) was in section 8. The later section would deal with the phenomenon we wanted excised from section 2. I am sure the Minister of State did not do this intentionally but he has done it. We have now reached section 8 and we find that the discretion given to the court is solely from the stage at which the court <Col N="1507" /> has become seized of the matter. The pre-condition to get that far is an entirely separate stand-alone section that must be overcome.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to shorten the time under which workers may insist on the implementation of a determination of the court following the use of the machinery of this legislation. The Minister of State made a slight concession at Select Committee stage when he brought the period from an incredible 12 months down to six months. Six months after the date of a determination under section 6 the court may, on the application of either party to a dispute, review such a determination and affirm the determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The period of six months is still too long. This concerns workers in a vulnerable position and recalcitrant employers. Such employers could get six months from a determination to when that can be reaffirmed, and then a further time-consuming <Col N="1508" /> process of moving to the Circuit Court can occur. That is too long and puts workers in an impossible position. I want this changed to &ldquo;at any time up to one year&rdquo;. That would allow a week or a few weeks, depending on circumstances, for an employer to implement the determination but no longer than that. I presume such a determination would be in favour of the workers concerned. The Minister admitted on Committee Stage that finality could be 18 months although the reality could be much longer, bearing in mind the Circuit Court lists and the possibility of referral to the High Court. A period of 18 months would be completely unacceptable and the Minister could foreshorten that time. If the Minister were disposed to accept Deputy Rabbitte's amendment, which proposes a six week period, I would be inclined to agree with that. The Minister must agree to a shortening of the period, otherwise a hard core of employers will play ducks and drakes with their employees, the Labour Court and other institutions. If they were reasonable and generous minded people, the matter would not necessitate the invocation of the machinery outlined in this Act in any case. A strong case can be made for further foreshortening the period involved and I hope the Minister will accept this.</P>

      <P>I support the arguments advanced by Deputy Higgins. The time scales outlined in this Bill are among the main issues which seriously skew this Bill in favour of recalcitrant employers. In the real world, people cannot afford to hang around for a couple of years in the hope that the union they risked joining will make a breakthrough. The reality is that people lose faith after a while. To expect people to have the stamina to see this process through over the period of a couple of years is entirely unfair. In the real world, people operate in a hostile environment in which employers, in all probability, know who joined the union and who did not. People cannot be expected to hang around for a conclusion which could be two years down the road. I urge the Minister to accept my amendment No. 9<i>a</i> which proposes the substitution of &ldquo;6 weeks&rdquo; for &ldquo;6 months&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I concur with Deputy Rabbitte. This issue could more appropriately be dealt with by way of statutory instrument rather than being fixed in legislation. The Minister could include a provision in the Bill to apply a statutory instrument in this regard. In that way, we could look to practice or experience in this area to indicate an appropriate period and that could be changed by statutory instrument. A six month period could be deemed to be far too long and six weeks could be viewed as far more practical. I agree that it is unacceptable to expect people to endure a prolonged period of time in an environment of bitter daily confrontation in the work place. A six month period would be ludicrous, to say the least.</P>

      <P>The approach adopted in this legislation seeks to maximise the scope for parties to reach agreement. Deputy Higgins' amendment would allow either party to immediately apply for a review of a determination in the absence of any discussion between the parties and that is not desirable. My amendment to section 9, passed on Committee Stage, shortened the time scale from 12 months to six months, a reasonable period within which the parties could explore the settlement of outstanding issues before considering the possibility of a review. I cannot accept Deputy Rabbitte's proposal to shorten the review period to six weeks as this would not be reasonable. I made a considerable advance on Committee Stage by reducing the period by six months.</P>

        <b>:</b> The Minister stated that my amendment would allow the parties to enter into a review at any time following determination in the absence of any discussion. In the real world, people will allow some time for discussion but, in any case, I intend to support Deputy Rabbitte's eminently reasonable six week proposal, the optimum which should be allowed in this matter. I urge the Minister to accept that.</P>
      <P>Why is the Minister trying to defend the indefensible? It is indefensible for an employer to refuse to implement a Labour Court finding relating to crucial matters affecting his or her employees. It is not acceptable that a six month period would be allowed prior to a further section of the State's industrial relations machinery coming into play. If one proceeds to the next section, which provides for a six week period from the findings of a review before an application can be made to the Circuit Court, one realises that the six month period is a mere tranche in the overall process. At that stage, we are into Circuit Court lists. People who are familiar with hanging around &ldquo;The Four Gold Mines&rdquo; as they are colloquially called or, to be official, The Four Courts, know what lists entail. While the Minister may not be in a position to control the courts, he can control the amount of time provided in this Bill. I intend to withdraw my amendment but I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 9<i>a.</i></P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to speed up what is a totally inadequate process. I am, simply, seeking that in a situation where a trade union or accepted body is forced to go to the Circuit Court to direct an employer to carry out a determination, that the employer do so within one year. Section 10(<i>b</i>) is somewhat changed as a result of the Minister of State's acceptance of amendment No. 9<i>a.</i> Nevertheless, the timescale should be shortened in order to give some meaning to the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My alternate amendment No. 11 advocates a slightly different way of measuring, but the objective is the same. As matters stand, the situation is manifestly unfair. My amendment seeks to substitute &ldquo;within one year from the date on which the determination is communicated to the parties&rdquo; with &ldquo;the time specified in that determination&rdquo; in a case where an employer fails to comply with the terms of a determination under section 6. This is typical of what one will find in a court determination. The amendment, if accepted by the Minister of State, would be welcomed by the court. It is extraordinary that the Bill is so prescriptive as to leave determinations to the discretion of the court. It is the content of the determination which ought to determine when the next phase of the process is triggered. One would think we were speaking about good employers we have been so protective of them. One loses sight of the fact at this hour of the night that what we are talking about is a handful of recalcitrant employers. Yet, every conceivable break is given to them. This is the final break. The trade union, having gone through all the hurdles which we spent all day talking about and <Col N="1511" /> complying with the legislation, is left in the situation where the employer refuses to comply. The Minister of State now wants to give the employer another year to make up his or her mind. This is unacceptable and I profoundly object.</P>
      <P>Adopting my approach to the matter would not tie the Minister of State's hands as I know his officials will recognise. I am not seeking to specify a particular time; I am, simply, saying that we should leave it to the court to specify in the determination what the timescale ought to be. Different timescales may be required in different circumstances. Cases differ all the time. My amendment takes a much wiser and fairer approach to the matter. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider his approach to it.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important aspects of the Bill. If we allow a further extension of one year after the determination has been made, we will break the heart and soul of workers seeking recognition within their employment. Taking the sequence of events into account, one would then be into the third year of the process. Legislation which ties the hands of workers for that length of time in order to secure what is constitutionally theirs is bad legislation. It will not make any positive contribution to the industrial relations problems we are facing.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State would talk us through the stages under the legislation as proposed outling the worst case scenario. Deputies have made a very valid and reasoned argument on the basis that we are not dealing with people who wish to engage in a voluntary process of agreement. That is a given. We are dealing with people who, by their very nature, given the previous sections we have passed, are engaging in situations which will not give rise to swift and positive action to ensure resolution of a problem. Perhaps the Minister of State would talk us through this situation. What Deputy Bell said is quite compelling. To think that at the end of this rather protracted procedure there will be an out of a further year is less than acceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy Higgins's amendment, it is important to understand that the Bill adopts the approach that employers and trade unions clearly have the chance to process and reflect on the outcome of the previous stage before referring the matter still in dispute to the next stage. Deputies have referred to the one year process which will not be availed of by many trade unions. We have given another option under section 9. There are two options available once a determination has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a debate during Committee Stage and again on Report Stage on the likely duration of the whole process. In reply to Deputy Flanagan's point, the Labour Court has a pivotal role in the fall-back procedure. I have been assured by it that it will deal with disputes <Col N="1512" /> referred to it expeditiously. Deputies will be aware that a trade union may initiate a process under section 2(1). A trade union may also activate a determination of the court under section 6(<i>i</i>) and that determination is binding. The trade union may wait 12 months before proceeding to the Circuit Court for an enforcement order. I do not envisage many taking up this option. I envisage trade unions availing of the quicker option whereby they can activate the review of a determination under section 9 where we changed the figure from 12 months to six months to three months. I acknowledge that the process should not be dragged out. That is why I introduced an amendment to section 9 which shortens the time scale for activating a review of a Labour Court determination from 12 months to six months. The trade union has the option to activate a review under that section or to wait for 12 months under section 10 before proceeding to seek an enforcement order in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>The same arguments hold regarding Deputy Rabbitte's amendment. Once a determination has been made by the Labour Court, a trade union has two options when an employer does not comply. We covered much of this ground on Committee Stage. Improvements to the system under section 9 have greatly improved the Bill.</P>
    <P>To allow the Labour Court to specify a different time limit in each case would leave the court open to challenges as to the reasons for varying the time limit from one case to another. That is another legal argument. It is legally safer to have one specified time limit in a given procedure. There are two options and a section 9 procedure would be more helpful for trade unions.</P>

      <P>The Bill has been marginally improved as a result of Opposition pressure. However, the process is still too drawn out. All that is required to go to the Circuit Court is that the court would reaffirm the determination made and state that it should be effected. Why is the Minister of State giving so much rope to employers to extend the process? People will pause for some time before appealing to the Circuit Court, and the court would argue that this is reasonable. However, even allowing for many months, this is grist to the mill of difficult employers and I will press the amendment.</P>

He will not get the promotion I envisage for him with an election around the corner at the end of September. We want to facilitate the Minister of State and I do not wish to do anything to damage his standing.</P>
      <P>The Bill is immensely weakened as a result of the Minister of State's refusal to take any of this on board. He pleads section 9 as the reason the period has been foreshortened and so on. It is foreshortened in the sense that the period after which action may be taken is now three months rather than six months. However, the rest of the line states, &ldquo;but not later than one year&rdquo; from the date. That point is not being taken into account.</P>
      <P>Section 11 outlines that where an appeal is made to the High Court on a point of law, there is not a constraining factor. It appears that an employer can go to the High Court on a point of law whenever he or she wishes to do so. Deputy Higgins's Old Man River is apposite. I am not afraid of this Bill dying because it does not amount to a great deal.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State seriously consider amending this section along the lines of leaving the discretion with the court in terms of the time specified in the determination? I do not accept the contention that the Labour Court would be open to legal action as a result of varying the terms from one case to another. It does so all the time, depending on the circumstances. Any employer who took the Labour Court to court because it varied the time from one case to another would soon get his or her answer. The courts would not unreasonably intrude into the affairs of the Labour Court where it was doing its business as it saw fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to reply to this matter. I compliment the staff at all levels in the maternity department of St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel. They provide an excellent service, often in difficult circumstances because of inadequate resources. The department covers a wide geographical area, including south Tipperary, north west Waterford in the South-Eastern Health Board region and Thurles in the Mid-Western Health Board region. It is a busy unit which last year handled just under 1,000 births, 1,000 theatre procedures, an epidural service, ante-natal clinics in outlying areas, including Tipperary town and Thurles, and a walk-in ultrasound/scan clinic. The medical, nursing and non-nursing staff also provide a consultant gynaecological service to in-patients, outpatients and in theatre. The staff is highly skilled, well trained and committed. However, equipment and staff shortages compromise the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level and quality of service being provided can only be maintained and developed by the provision of adequate staff and equipment resources. It is not possible to continue to properly meet the demands of the service if the structures and staffing do not develop in line with the <Col N="1515" /> increasing number of referrals. It is important to remember that there is no provision for the maternity unit in terms of upgrading or a new building in the new hospital development at St. Joseph's.</P>
    <P>The current position is that consultants work a one in two rota. This is unsustainable, particularly given that the number of Caesarean sections is increasing and there are changed maternity practices. The level of anaesthetic staff is inadequate and includes a non-existent junior anaesthetic staff. This means the epidural service is effectively part-time for 16 hours a day and there is no night epidural service. There is a requirement for at least six to eight additional midwifes, including the provision of a dedicated theatre nursing staff out of hours, additional non-consultant hospital doctors, support staff and additional updated equipment.</P>
    <P>When does the Minister intend to approve the request for the appointment of the third consultant obstetrician/gynaecologist? This request has been with the Department for a considerable time and when I raised this matter recently in a parliamentary question, I received unspecific information; the reply amounted to a lot of waffle. When does the Minister intend to properly staff, equip and resource the department? There is an emerging concern in the county and at hospital level that the Minister's Department and the South-Eastern Health Board may have embarked on a policy of starving the department of resources with a view to running down the service at Clonmel, leading to its eventual closure and possible transfer to a regional centre, such as Waterford. This would be unacceptable in south Tipperary and it will be opposed tooth and nail by the people.</P>
    <P>I ask to the Minister to confirm his categorical support for the maternity unit at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, his opposition to any suggestion of running down, closing or transferring the unit and his approval for additional staffing and equipment necessary to maintain a quality maternity service for the people of south Tipperary based at the hospital.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the issue of maternity services in St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, and the overall development of the hospital. The Deputy's suggestion about possible changes involving the unit is most unfair to the Department of Health and Children and the Government because no such agenda exists. The Government is responsible for the biggest investment ever in the hospital. A £15 million development programme is currently under way, which is the single largest project since the opening of the hospital. My colleagues in the constituency, including the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and others, have lobbied for that programme for a long time and it is wrong to create false fears about the maternity service which handled 900 <Col N="1516" /> births last year. It is a sustainable and feasible service and its continuation will be supported. There is no question of me or the Department&mdash;</P>

      <P>The issue of maternity services is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance. As the Deputy suggested, people occasionally by-pass the health boards in terms of statutory authority. The health boards must also develop policies on these matters. In this instance, the health board has identified and confirmed that the provision of a comprehensive quality driven and readily accessible obstetric and gynaecological service is a fundamental and integral part of care services for the region. A comprehensive obstetric/gynaecological service is provided at St. Joseph's Hospital, led by two consultants and their non-consultant support staff who deal with approximately 900 births annually.</P>
      <P>Paediatric services at the hospital are provided by two paediatricians, one of whom has a special interest in neonatology. The South-Eastern Health Board has also approved an additional post of registrar as an interim measure to enhance the current service to patients. The appointment of a fifth consultant anaesthetist at the hospital has been sanctioned and it is currently being processed by the Local Appointments Commission. This will improve the situation significantly in relation to epidural cover.</P>
      <P>An application has been made to the Department by the South-Eastern Health Board for financial approval of a third consultant obstetrician/gynaecologist post at the hospital. This application, which includes provision for non-consultant support staff, is being considered by the Department in the context of available resources and the priority accorded to the post by the board. The Department will be in contact with the board and will revert to the House on the matter. As the Deputy is aware, the creation of an additional consultant post is subject to the approval of Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of patients waiting for gynaecological services at St. Joseph's Hospital reduced by 20% during the period December 1999 to December 2000. This reduction reflects the national trend in the same period which showed a 46% reduction in the number of patients awaiting gynaecological procedures. Such figures are not often mentioned in relation to the improving situation with regard to the waiting lists for certain <Col N="1517" /> categories. I am confident that the substantial resources which have been provided under the waiting list initiative will continue to reduce waiting lists and improve services generally in hospitals. The objective is to provide a patient focused service within which the priority must be equity of access to high quality care, based on clinical need.</P>
    <P>In terms of the overall development of services at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, phase 1 of a major £15 million development is under way. This development will include the provision of a new accident and emergency department, ward accommodation, operating theatres, an ICU and a central sterile supplies department.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>According to CSO figures, County Offaly has the lowest <i>per capita</i> income in the country. As a representative of the people of the county I find it alarming that <i>per capita</i> income is £7,394. By contrast, <i>per capita</i> income in Dublin is £3,750 in excess of that. The Government and Fianna Fáil public representatives have questions to answer as the blame for this worsening situation rests on their shoulders. Is the Minister of State aware that disposable income for the average Offaly resident is down from 84% of the national average in 1988 to 79% today? He has nothing to smile about.</P>
      <P>This serious situation for the people of County Offaly must be urgently addressed to provide income and employment opportunities and to improve services, infrastructure and educational facilities. Following consultations with Deputy Flanagan and Fine Gael public representatives in the county, including members of Offaly County Council, Tullamore and Birr Urban Council and Edenderry Town Commission, it is clear the Government has failed to deliver to the people of the county in terms of jobs, road infrastructure, rail networks and decentralisation.</P>
      <P>The employment situation is especially serious. Low Alpine has shed 220 jobs, Snickers 20 and Daibier 20, all in Tullamore. More than 100 jobs have been lost at Leoinie in Birr and approximately 150 jobs at Arlington in Portarlington were lost just over two years ago. In addition, Bord na Móna has undertaken a major reorganisation resulting in approximately 1,500 redundancies over a five year period while the ESB is undergoing continuing reorganisation with future job losses planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA, Shannon Development and the Government failed to react with the urgency that <Col N="1518" /> is essential to provide alternative employment. The number of new overseas industries attracted to County Offaly has not matched the numbers of jobs lost. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has refused to meet Offaly County Council to discuss new industries and new employment opportunities for the county. She did not attend the Dáil when Deputy Quinn raised the issue of job losses in Tullamore and the people of the county will be unhappy at her failure to attend the House this evening.</P>
    <P>County Offaly needs an ambitious road building programme as a modern road structure is essential to develop the county. The necessary investment has not been allocated. In the recent announcement of funding by the NRA the county was not included in the budget of £660 million. The county is the fourth smallest in terms of expenditure on roads with County Laois the fifth smallest. The Government must prioritise County Offaly for new industry, road investment, rail lines and decentralisation. All are essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Enright on this matter. The failure of the Tánaiste and Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to attend the debate speaks volumes. The situation is very serious. Job losses have not been replaced and task forces appointed by the Government are under achieving. For the past 20 years redundancies have been proposed in the twin anchor employers of Bord na Móna and the ESB. The warning about changing working patterns have been ignored by the Government. Circumstances in traditional industries in the midlands have given rise to serious redundancies and action has not been taken.</P>
      <P>The only major development in County Offaly is the construction on the N6 route. It will create little benefit to people in the midlands as traffic is pushed from Dublin to Galway with careless disregard for their livelihoods, especially those in County Offaly. I call on the Minister to visit the county. She has refused to do so and refuses to understand the serious and high levels of unemployment throughout the county, from the Kildare border to the River Shannon. The county is a black spot and immediate action is required by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Government of collective responsibility. I regret the Minister cannot be here but she is abroad on a trade mission seeking international investment for the country. Any Member here to answer on behalf of the Government does so on a the basis of collective responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of jobs in any area is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies and not one in which the Minister would have a direct function. The Government through the enterprise development agencies is committed to ensuring the most equitable distribution of <Col N="1519" /> job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions. The agencies are strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this. A key factor in achieving this, the primary objective of the Government, is the creation of a business environment in which job opportunities continue to flourish and in which job applicants have the requisite skills requirements.</P>
    <P>In line with commitments contained in the national development plan, the enterprise development agencies are strongly focused on achieving this aim and resources are being deployed to reflect this new focus. In recognition of the economic underdevelopment of the Border, midlands and west region, in which I live, and of which County Offaly is a part, the region qualifies for Objective One status over the lifetime of the national development plan. In the context of its Objective One status, the industrial development agencies, under the aegis of the Department, can provide projects in the BMW region with more favourable funding across the range of financial supports than projects elsewhere. For its part, IDA Ireland fully recognises and is committed to ensuring that a process of balanced regional dispersal is achieved in the BMW region. A key priority of the agency in the midlands region is the pursuit of a more balanced regional spread of new overseas investments to secure significant industrial developments in this Objective One area.  The policy of IDA Ireland is to focus on projects with jobs of higher salary and on enhancing the quality of existing jobs. Recent projects in County Offaly include Continental AG and Flextronics in Tullamore, Sanirish in Edenderry and Grafica Zannini, which has completed the construction of its new facility in Tullamore. Through development programmes which IDA Ireland operates it is aimed to have capable companies moving systematically up the value chain from being basically mandated subsidiary operations to being strategically independent operations within their corporate structures world-wide. Last year 589 new jobs were created by IDA Ireland assisted companies in the midlands region, resulting in a net gain for the year of 105 jobs. The total number of IDA jobs thus created for the region amounted to 6,208. This increase in employment reflects how IDA Ireland's strategy to secure 50% of all green field projects for the Border, midlands and west regions is beginning to show positive results.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development, which has responsibility for developing indigenous industry in south-west Offaly has reported an increase in employment in its client companies in indigenous industry of 5% in south Offaly during the past year. Its year end 2000 employment survey shows a net increase of 33 in indigenous employment in south-west Offaly. A major Shannon Development initiative in the Birr area is the Birr technology centre. This is a £2.4 million project, which represents a major milestone for the incubation <Col N="1520" /> and growth of knowledge based industry in south Offaly. The new technology incentive facility will provide more than 23,000 square feet of high quality office space geared towards businesses of the high growth knowledge based services sector.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is also deeply committed to promoting balance regional economic development. Its strategy is to help new and existing enterprises to flourish in their communities. It is not primarily about relocation. The agency currently supports 144 client companies in the midlands region, employing 5,406 people mainly in the food and consumer products and industrial centres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is against construction on the N6. He does not want it through his area. The agency's new regional development strategy, which was launched by the Minster on 5 February, sets out, <i>inter alia, </i>the basis of Enterprise Ireland's response to both the job losses and experience in the Laois-Offaly area and the under performance of the midlands region.</P>
      <P>The agency recognises that there has been in many parts of the midlands region a low level of entrepreneurship and innovation, especially in those areas distant from third level institutions. Among a range of measures designed to address this problem is an initiative aimed at the provision of campus incubation and commercial research and development space in the institutes of technology. This has been developed in conjunction with the BMW regional assembly, for which financial support of up to £2 million for each centre is envisaged.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland also works with a number of locally based groups, including Offaly County Development Board, the Offaly County Enterprise Board &ndash; a major success story &ndash; and the Offaly CEB evaluation committee and local community groups throughout the county with a view to stimulating new projects generation among micro enterprises, thus leading to new job creation.</P>
      <P>Its midlands regional office team also provides a customised and confidential service for Dublin based companies considering relocation. The agency has established a target of 30 expansions of Dublin based companies to be located outside the capital and is committed to working with local authorities, developers and local communities throughout counties Offaly, Laois, Westmeath and Longford to develop a marketing strategy to attract some of these projects to the midlands. In addition, the midlands region will benefit from a higher level of funding&mdash;</P>

Over the three year period of the regional development strategy, in excess of 30% of Enterprise Ireland's financial supports to companies will be committed to projects in the BMW region. The combined efforts of the enterprise development agencies will ensure both the region in general and County Offaly in particular will benefit significantly in coming years under the positive leadership and detailed attention of the Government to all parts of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not even take me five minutes. I often wonder why we go through this <Col N="1522" /> charade, but I will give it a lash tonight. This matter relates to a site in my constituency which the Department of Education and Science purchased in 1979-80 and which has been developed into playing pitches which I have been seeking for the past six months to get the Department to permit local schools and teams to use.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting of South Dublin County Council, I was informed that some years ago the council carried out works on behalf of the Department of Education and Science to upgrade the lands at the school. It was understood that pending any development of the lands by the Department this land would be available for allocation as playing pitches by the council to local clubs. That was on 17 April this year. On 7 March I was informed by the Department that the site had been acquired by it for the provision of a second level school and that no final decision in relation to such a school had been taken. Pending a final decision in that regard, the Department said that it would be inappropriate to develop the site for any alternative use.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State need not read his script because I am not interested in hearing it. I want him to go to the Department of Education and Science and ask whatever section is responsible for the site to allow the local community to use these public lands which have been lying unused for the past 20 years while the Department procrastinates as to whether it wishes to build a secondary school. The land has been maintained by South Dublin County Council and I want it to be used by the local community and the two local schools whose pupils must travel five miles to their local pitches even though there is a perfect site behind the schools which could be available tomorrow morning. The council wishes to put up a few posts to allow the children to play there, but for some astonishing bureaucratic reason the Department of Education and Science does not wish to accede to the requests of the school managers, teachers, pupils and council.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State use his good offices to cut through this bureaucratic nonsense and allow the children and the community to use these lands? The site is publicly owned and should be used for the right purposes until a decision is made about a new secondary school. I am seeking a decision which would permit my constituents to use those fine facilities as playing pitches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to the debate as Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology at the Department of Education and Science. I am deputising for my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Woods. I welcome the opportunity to outline the position regarding the future use of the Department of Education and Science owned site at Kingswood Heights, Tallaght.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to housing developments in the 1970s, the Department purchased two sites in the Kilnamanagh-Kingswood Heights area with the <Col N="1523" /> intention of providing two post-primary schools. One of the sites is now the home of Coláiste de hIde, the all-Irish post-primary school in Tallaght. The other site at Kingswood Heights was never developed.</P>
    <P>In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was considerable local demand for a post-primary school in the area. The arguments for a school were based on the lack of post-primary facilities in the immediate area rather than a shortage of places in post-primary schools in the vicinity of Castleview. A detailed analysis of the need for a post-primary school was undertaken by the planning section of the Department of Education and Science in 1996. This analysis showed that there was adequate post-primary provision within a reasonable distance of the proposed site. A recent review of the study has indicated that this position has not changed. Both primary and post-primary enrolments are in decline in the area.</P>
    <P>Approaches have been made to the building unit of the Department by a number of interested parties regarding acquisition of the Kingswood Heights site or a portion thereof for alternative use. City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee has indicated an interest in acquiring a portion of the site to build new office accommodation for its staff. A proposal has also been made by South Dublin County Council for the use of the lands in question for playing pitches. Both are positive proposals.</P>
    <P>No final decision in relation to the provision of a post-primary school on the Department's site at Kingswood Heights has been taken and, pending a decision, it would be inappropriate to make any commitment to dispose of the site at this time. However, as a representative of a political party committed to the development of sport to the highest levels, I will discuss the matter with my officials in the Department tomorrow and see what can be done to progress it. I hope the Deputy can endorse the development of sport in Ireland by supporting all the investment the Government wishes to make in the development of excellent facilities across the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. I am disappointed that the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is not present. He made some comments tonight regarding the state of the industry to the effect that it would be down by approximately 14% this year. He might have made that comment in anticipation of this debate, but I am disappointed that he did not come to the House to face the music. My information from those involved in the industry is that the reduction will be 30% this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry is looking extremely bleak. Everybody worked hard to prevent foot and mouth disease spreading through the country, but the tourism industry has, in effect, fallen on its sword. It <Col N="1524" /> has been most co-operative. The British market has been declining for a number of years. This year, it is down 30% in some areas. One operator told me today that it is down 50%. Last year, Irish Ferries brought in 1.8 million tourists, but this year 600,000 of that number might not travel.</P>
    <P>The outlook is not good. The situation could be saved, however, if the Minister would organise a concentrated marketing programme in Britain. There has been no such programme to date and if it does not happen soon, the industry will be in serious trouble. The industry also needs support in its marketing. This support has not been forthcoming. A sum of £10 million is supposed to have been made available, but it is only arriving in dribs and drabs and not all of it has yet been released. I am also informed that the corporate market depends on a quotations mechanism, but that this mechanism has now dried up.</P>
    <P>The Minister is in clould cuckoo land. He should stop talking to the generals and talk instead to the foot soldiers in the industry. Generals do not get shot in wars. There is a war in the industry and it is the foot soldiers of the tourism industry who are taking the hits. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, must know that the same situation applies in the west, if he is in touch with his constituents, which he must be with an election on the horizon. The tourism industry throughout the country is in trouble.</P>
    <P>British people who visit Ireland in their cars will travel the length and breadth of the country, spreading the benefit accordingly. Obviously, we must still be vigilant with regard to foot and mouth disease. The Minister of State should encourage the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to do his utmost now, because the British market is not like the American one where people plan months in advance. People in the British market make a decision to travel shortly before they travel, which means we still have time to salvage something from this market. I am told June, July and August will be horrendous for the industry unless the Minister gets his act together and forces Bord Fáilte to market the country and work to save jobs in the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>It must begin now but there is no sense of urgency from the Government. The Minister was wringing his hands again this evening asking what could he do. There is a train drivers' strike affecting the industry and the Minister for Public Enterprise is wringing her hands asking what can she do. I would like to know what the Minister of State present proposes to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter on the Adjournment. He will be aware that my Government colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, has already outlined on a number of occasions in recent weeks the position regarding the impact of foot and mouth disease on the tourism and hospitality industry and the action taken to ameliorate the situation. The <Col N="1525" /> Minister has dealt with this matter on three separate occasions on the Adjournment, in a Private Members' motion, in two appearances before the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation of which the Deputy is a member, in a statement in the Seanad and in two separate parliamentary question sessions. He is a busy Minister.</P>
      <P>While official CSO figures for overseas visitor numbers and revenue earnings for the year to date are not yet available, I understand from Bord Fáilte that latest industry estimates put total losses in tourism earnings incurred through cancellations and through lost bookings since the onset of the foot and mouth disease crisis at £225 million. This figure comprises £175 million in respect of foreign earnings and £50 million in domestic business.</P>
      <P>Without taking into account the beneficial impact of the measures I will outline later, potential losses of out of State tourism revenue in 2001 could, according to Bord Fáilte, be as high as £500 million, with additional losses in domestic earnings of the order of £140 million, depending on market conditions and performance for the remainder of the year. Let us hope these estimates turn out to be pessimistic.</P>
      <P>As a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis, Bord Fáilte's target of 6.6 million overseas visitors for the year 2001 will be extremely difficult to achieve. However, I understand the chairman of Bord Fáilte has set as a current objective, which he sees as challenging in itself, the achievement of a similar level of performance as last year.</P>
      <P>The Government target for tourism growth as set out within the framework of the national development plan is for an average annual increase of 5% in foreign exchange earnings over the period of the plan up to 2006. Given that the performance in 2000 was well ahead of that target, there are no plans at this stage to revise it.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy McDaid, and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation have worked closely with Bord Fáilte and the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation since the onset of the crisis to ameliorate the adverse impact on the tourism and hospitality industry. Taking on board many of the suggestions put forward from the industry, we have taken a range of measures to deal with the situation, including the following ten specific actions.</P>
      <P>The first action is encouraging the tourism and hospitality industry to support the national campaign to minimise the risks of a spread of foot and mouth disease through the application of appropriate control measures and disinfectant procedures. They have worked reasonably well and we still aggressively pursue this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second action is setting up structured arrangements to ensure the views of the industry are taken on board, especially when decisions are being made on the application and modification of control measures. The Minister and the Department are represented on the Government task force which has convened regularly under <Col N="1526" /> the chairmanship of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, to review measures to prevent the spread of the disease. In addition, a separate high level tourism action group under the chairmanship of the chief executive of Bord Fáilte and including key representatives of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the Department has been established to monitor foot and mouth situation on a continuous basis. This group has met twice weekly to manage actively issues affecting tourism business already booked and to limit any medium to long-term damage to the industry's image and prospects overseas.</P>
    <P>The third action is pressing strongly for a phased modification of the control measures and restrictions in so far as they affect tourism and in line with the emerging risk. We must take into account the situation in Northern Ireland. This action helped to bring about the welcome easing of the restrictions on a range of events and activities in the tourism and sports areas in line with the advice of the technical expert group established by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh.</P>
    <P>The fourth action is seeking the phased re-opening of key State cultural and heritage attractions to allow a full and varied array of facilities to be available to visitors. All these attractions are now being re-opened by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and Dúchas in line with advice from the technical expert group and under the direction of the Minister, Deputy de Valera.</P>
    <P>The fifth action is arranging, through the Bord Fáilte Tourism Ireland website, the associated call centres and other websites to ensure regularly updated information is available to visitors and the trade about major attractions and events which are open to the public.</P>
    <P>The sixth action is issuing a clear message that Ireland is open for tourism business and that, subject to taking appropriate precautions, Ireland remains a welcoming destination for international visitors, including visitors from Britain. This message has been delivered clearly and unequivocally by the President, Mary McAleese, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the Minister, Deputy McDaid.</P>
    <P>The seventh action is pressing for an easing of the restrictions on the movement of people within Ireland in line with advice from the technical expert group to help the accommodation sector especially. This has included strong encouragement to the commercial, business and State sectors not to cancel or postpone seminars, conferences, meetings and training programmes.</P>
    <P>The eighth action is successfully securing the lifting of the ban on angling.</P>
    <P>The ninth action is appealing to banks, financial institutions and the Revenue Commissioners to be as sympathetic as possible in the case of any tourism business experiencing temporary cash flow difficulties arising from the foot and mouth disease crisis. This appeal drew a very welcome <Col N="1527" /> response from the Irish Bankers' Federation on 30 March last when it indicated its members' commitment to give careful and sympathetic consideration to requests for support from those business customers who encounter financial difficulties. The Department of Finance has also confirmed that, in so far as certain cash flow problems arise for individual businesses, Revenue will, as part of normal arrangements, look sympathetically at payment arrangements on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>The tenth action is putting together and rolling out a major tourism marketing reassurance campaign, the initial phase of which is under way with special media advertising in all key markets, trade reassurance measures and special promotional <Col N="1528" /> visits. Details of the campaign, including the actions envisaged in key markets, are available directly from Bord Fáilte. The campaign, which has been costed by Bord Fáilte at £10 million and in respect of which £8 million in funding is already in place, has been designed in full consultation with the tourism industry.</P>

      <Quest>if the Government will be supporting, within the European Union Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Bush administration's missile defence programme; and if he will make a statement on the United States' missile defence programme.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is studying the proposals put forward by President Bush last week for a missile defence programme. These proposals are of a general nature, and the US administration has yet not made clear its thinking on a number of specific aspects.</P>
      <P>I agree with others that the declared intention of the US administration to reduce further its stockpile of nuclear war-heads is, in itself, positive. The previous administration accepted last year, at the United Nations General Assembly, the objective put forward by Ireland, together with its partners in the New Agenda Coalition of the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Any genuine progress in this direction would of course be a constructive step.</P>
      <P>However, the Government is very concerned at some of the implications of the latest US proposals, notably for the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, concluded in 1972. This treaty, signed by the United States and the Soviet Union, has served the world well as a cornerstone of nuclear arms reductions and as a central element in diminishing the risk of the outbreak of nuclear war. In this regard, it can be seen as a vital framework until such time as nuclear weapons have been eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President Bush has now made it clear that his administration does not regard the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty as relevant to what he describes as &lsquo;the new strategic environment' and he has also made it clear that the United States sees a need &lsquo;to move beyond the constraints' of the ABM treaty. I would be extremely concerned if this could lead to the ending of the ABM treaty and the consequential destabilisation of the present nuclear balance. This could result in a renewed nuclear weapons arms race and the further proliferation of nuclear weapons. It is for this reason that Ireland has supported resolutions at the two most recent sessions of the UN general assembly on the need to uphold the existing framework of <Col N="1530" /> the ABM treaty and in the context of plans leading to the elimination of the nuclear arsenals.</P>
    <P>I recall that, at the fifth review conference of the states parties to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty last year, the 187 states parties, including the five nuclear weapons states, agreed 'that the ABM treaty be strengthened as a cornerstone of strategic stability and as a basis for further reductions of strategic offensive weapons.' It is our hope therefore that the Bush Administration will have regard to the commitment which was undertaken by the United States at the non-proliferation treaty review conference.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Bush Administration intends to consult its allies on the steps that it is proposing to take. As the Swedish presidency of the EU has already made clear, such consultations are a matter for NATO.</P>
    <P>The EU does not have an agreed position on missile defence. The Union does have, however, a strong position on the dangers of nuclear proliferation and the Union is also committed to the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to work in all appropriate fora to achieve the objectives of its disarmament policy in relation to weapons of mass destruction.</P>

      <Quest>the progress made on curtailing the use of plastic baton rounds in Northern Ireland following Parliamentary Question No. 260 of 30 January 2001; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has on a number of occasions expressed its concerns about the deaths and serious injuries which have resulted from the use of plastic baton rounds &ndash; PBRs &ndash; in Northern Ireland. We have consistently urged the need for stricter controls and maximum restraint to curtail the use of these bullets to the greatest possible extent.</P>
      <P>The Patten report acknowledged the concerns about PBRs and, although it did not recommend an outright ban at that stage, the report did express a desire to &lsquo;see the use of PBRs discontinued as soon as possible.' Patten made a number of recommendations about their deployment and use and also specifically recommended that &lsquo;an immediate and substantial investment be made in a research programme to find an acceptable, effective and less potentially lethal alternative to the PBR.' </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government accepted these recommendations and initiated the research project in July 2000. The first phase of the project has been completed and the next phase, the formulation of proposals for further research, will be completed in October. The third phase will be to carry out further research, while the final phase will be to define &lsquo;operational objectives for public order <Col N="1531" /> equipment.' We want to see a speedy conclusion of phase two and rapid progress in the remaining phases.</P>
    <P>Against this background, concerns have been expressed about the proposed introduction of a new PBR from 1 June onwards. The Taoiseach has said that &lsquo;the Government have grave reservations about the proposed introduction of a new form of plastic bullet, which can be even more lethal to certain vulnerable parts of the body like the head.' The scientific report commissioned by the British Ministry of Defence raises some very serious issues about the new PBR. In particular, the report says that the severity of injuries to vulnerable parts of the body is likely to be greater in comparison with the type currently in use.</P>
    <P>The clear spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and the Patten report is that PBRs should be phased out, not renewed or replaced in a different format. Our serious concerns about the new PBR and its proposed introduction in June have been raised with the British authorities through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>We welcome, however, the measures being implemented by the British Government to limit the use of plastic bullets, including by restricting their deployment to a reduced number of specially trained and authorised officers.</P>
    <P>I should note that there has been a low incidence of PBR usage in Northern Ireland over the past year and a half &ndash; 26 in 2000 and three to date this year. It is vital that this trend continue and that the use of PBRs be kept to the absolute minimum in the coming months, with a view to eliminating their use entirely as quickly as possible. It is our view that public order issues can be properly resolved through effective community policing.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 54 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>I met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid, in London last Thursday. Our meeting allowed us to take stock of developments across a range of issues. I have also been in regular contact on these issues with the pro-Agreement political parties in Northern Ireland. The Taoiseach and I met with Mr. Trimble last Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussions, both at ministerial and official level, useful and constructive work has been done and we have been able to make some headway. <Col N="1532" /> At all times we have been conscious of the need to make progress as quickly as possible including on policing, decommissioning, demilitarisation and the successful and inclusive operation of the institutions.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, however, the parties are now very focused on the forthcoming local and Westminster elections which, following yesterday's announcement by Prime Minister Blair, will take place on 7 June. While it is most unlikely that we will be able to achieve the type of breakthrough we require until the elections are over, we will continue to work in a low-key manner so as to be in a position to make early progress immediately thereafter.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, aware of the statement made by First Minister Trimble yesterday. In May of last year the two Governments said that it was our goal to secure the remaining steps necessary to achieve the full implementation of the Agreement by June. That remains the case. I call on all parties to do their utmost to achieve this outcome.</P>

      <P>HIV-AIDS is having a major negative impact in the poorest countries of the world and is contributing to an increase in poverty and a decline in development indicators in these situations. At the end of last year, over 36 million people were believed to have been infected with HIV-AIDS. It is estimated that over 22 million people have died of the disease to date. HIV infection is concentrated in countries that can least afford the sickness, death and loss of productivity it brings.</P>
      <P>The majority of those infected with HIV virus &ndash; 95% of the global total &ndash; live in the developing world in sub-Saharan Africa and the developing countries of Asia. In these situations HIV-AIDS has wiped out decades of steady improvement in life expectancy.</P>
      <P>Sub-Saharan Africa continues to bear the brunt of HIV and AIDS &ndash; we now know that almost 25 million Africans are living with this disease. On that continent, HIV-AIDS is now the major cause of premature death among young adults. It is responsible for the deaths of seven out of 10 people who die in this age group. It is expected that the number of people who become infected in this age group will continue to increase.</P>
      <P>This has hugely important economic and social implications for these countries as it is this important population sub-group who contribute to the economic development of a society and who are responsible for the upbringing and welfare of young families. In these situations HIV serves to further contribute to high levels of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> HIV-AIDS is a major public health and development challenge in all countries in Africa where the Irish Government is providing financial support for development programmes, that is, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.</P>
    <P>The extent of the problem and the way this disease is undermining development progress, particularly in countries benefiting from Ireland Aid support, requires a response that is urgent, resourced, focused and sustained.</P>
    <P>The need to support HIV-AIDS interventions has been well recognised by Ireland Aid. In January 2000, the Minister of State launched a new HIV-AIDS strategy for the Ireland Aid programme. Clearly, the availability of additional resources coupled with the publication of this strategy will allow Ireland Aid to continue to respond in a substantive and coherent manner to what is one of the greatest development challenges of our time.</P>
    <P>I am happy to convey to the Deputy that over the last year there has been much progress in ensuring that the Irish Government is responding to the global HIV-AIDS pandemic.</P>
    <P>Internationally, the Taoiseach has pressed for higher priority for the problem of HIV-AIDS in developing countries. He has raised the issue in his address to the United Nations millennium summit in September. He spoke also of the problem in the context of the EU-African Heads of State meeting in Cairo earlier in the year. Following his visit to Lesotho and South Africa last January, he wrote to the President of the European Commission to request that HIV-AIDS be afforded far greater priority in the development aid programme of the European Union.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Donnell has also lobbied tirelessly on this issue. She raised the issue in her discussions with the development council of the European Community. In the course of discussions with Mr. Nielson the EC Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, she conveyed our concern that the European Community should be demonstrating greater global leadership in the fight against this disease. Partly in response to these pressures, the European Union has recently adopted a strategy for &lsquo;accelerated action against HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases'.</P>
    <P>In the case of Ireland Aid, international advocacy has been complemented by the allocation of increased financial resources for HIV-AIDS activities. Over the last year, substantial additional grant allocations were made to UNAIDS, the World Health Organisation, and the International Aids Vaccine Initiative. Several other such programmes are currently under consideration. In addition, new resources were made available for HIV-AIDS programmes in the priority countries for Ireland Aid. These are being implemented by both Government and NGOs.</P>
    <P>In the last year also, focal HIV-AIDS staff have been appointed in each priority country and <Col N="1534" /> there is now a requirement that a specific budgetary allocation be made for HIV-AIDS activities in each country programme. I would like to emphasise that these efforts are additional Ireland Aid support for the development and improvement of health services in all of our priority countries. Last year alone, over £11 million pounds were allocated for health service improvements in these situations.</P>
    <P>In a wider international context, the special UN session on AIDS next month will serve to galvanise international efforts to respond to the AIDS pandemic. The Taoiseach will lead the Irish delegation to this United Nations special session on HIV-AIDS. His presence at this meeting, together with that of my colleague Deputy O'Donnell signifies in a very tangible way the commitment of this Government to support international efforts to prevent and control this global disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57, 59 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the continuing and tragic violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ireland believes that United Nations observer forces can play an important role in situations of violence. Consequently, the Government was sympathetic to the proposal for a United Nations mechanism to afford protection to civilians in danger due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We firmly support practical measures to achieve this, but recognise that it can only be done with the consent of both the Palestinians and the Israelis and cannot be imposed.</P>
      <P>During March, Ireland was actively involved in intensive discussions at the United Nations Security Council about the situation in the Middle East. The council was very close to agreement on a resolution, drafted in part and co-sponsored by Ireland, addressing the full range of issues involved.</P>
      <P>Had this resolution been adopted, it would have marked concrete, practical progress towards ending the violence and resuming peace negotiations. In particular, it would have mandated the UN Secretary General to consult the parties on how to implement a mechanism to protect civilians. We still see this as the best way forward.</P>
      <P>It also called for an immediate end to all acts of violence and provocation; resumption of contacts at all levels; an end to the closures of Palestinian towns and territory; resumption of peace negotiations; implementation of existing undertakings; the transfer by Israel to the Palestinian Authority of all revenues due; full co-operation with the fact-finding committee inquiring into the outbreak of violence; and generous financial assistance to the Palestinian people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in the final event, a different text was tabled, one which sought to establish an observer force without the agreement of the parties. An observer mission could not be deployed or function effectively without the consent and co-oper<Col N="1536" /> ation of both sides. It would be contrary to all UN peacekeeping practice to impose such a mission except in the case of chapter VII enforcement under the UN Charter, which was not the position in this case.</P>
    <P>In our opinion, the draft tabled was impractical and did not have any chance of making a positive contribution. Together with France, Norway and UK, we therefore abstained in the vote. We did this in order to safeguard the substantial progress made on all sides, largely through the efforts of the European members of the Security Council, to achieve a worthwhile outcome. Ireland is continuing to explore if a further constructive effort in the Security Council may be possible in the future.</P>
    <P>As no agreement has been achieved on a UN observer force, it would not be appropriate at this point to speculate on the terms of reference of such a mission, nor on any possible role for the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the Government decided last September to move progressively to the United Nations target for assistance for poorer countries of 0.7% of GNP and that this target would be reached by the year 2007.</P>
      <P>Based on the GNP estimates available at the time of the decision, projections were calculated to increase the scale of the programme annually sufficient to reach an interim target of 0.45% of GNP next year and the UN target of 0.7% of GNP in 2007. Those same projections informed an arrangement whereby the core element of official development aid &ndash; vote 39 &ndash; the aid allocation under my control, was agreed with the Minister for Finance for a three year period from 2001 to 2003. The intention of this unique deal was to ensure the interim target would be reached and that momentum to the UN target would be maintained thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>In a reply to this House on 22 March, I outlined the Government's view on developments in Zimbabwe over the previous 12 months and the actions we have taken to make our serious concerns known to the Zimbabwean authorities.</P>
      <P>I regret that there has been no improvement in the situation since then. A report on Zimbabwe was published by the International Bar Association on 23 April. It presented a disturbing picture of a Government and legal system that is patently failing to protect the basic human rights of its citizens and guarantee the rule of law. Similar concerns were expressed by the Zimbabwean Catholic hierarchy in a statement issued on 1 May.</P>
      <P>Freedom of the press continues to be seriously eroded and the independence of the judiciary remains under threat from numerous Government interventions. I am particularly concerned at the continued harassment and intimidation of leading opposition figures, including the leader of the Movement of Democratic Change. These attacks are clearly aimed at depriving the people of Zimbabwe of meaningful presidential elections in 2002. Recent reports of threats to embassies and foreign companies and the continued failure of the Government to reach a satisfactory solution to the issue of land reform are also causes for concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With our EU partners, we have consistently called on President Mugabe to put an end to the violence and intimidation, and to ensure full respect for democratic principles, human rights <Col N="1538" /> and the rule of law. We have urged the Government to establish a constructive dialogue with the opposition and have stressed the importance of guaranteeing all parties their democratic right to operate freely. It is essential that the right of the people of Zimbabwe to express their views openly and without fear of violence be respected. I also firmly believe that bipartisan co-operation and respect for democratic principles are essential if the serious economic and social difficulties facing the country are to be overcome.</P>
    <P>The EU has embarked on a dialogue with Zimbabwe aimed at creating a stable democratic political environment and thereby contributing to the full protection of human rights. Progress at this dialogue has been slower to date than we would have liked. However, we are determined that our concerns regarding political violence, respect for democratic principles, freedom of expression and freedom of the press will continue to be fully articulated during this dialogue and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>On 26 April, by a margin of 263 to 89, the Ukrainian Parliament passed a vote of no-confidence in Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko's Government. The Government will continue in a caretaker capacity for 60 days. The vote confirmed the Parliament's division into three political forces, communists, centre-right national democrats and an ideologically amorphous group which is aligned with President Leonid Kuchma. Prime Minister Yushchenko was brought down by a coalition in the Rada between the latter group and the communists, who were adamantly <Col N="1539" /> opposed to Yushchenko's pro-Western foreign policy. The pro-Kuchma forces had for several months been concerned at the erosion of their economic power by the Yushchenko Government's energy sector reforms. President Kuchma in the end registered his support for the retention of Mr. Yushchenko but his traditional supporters in Parliament decided to ignore him by voting to dismiss Yushchenko.</P>
      <P>In relation to freedom of the press, Ukraine has seen an unusual level of public unrest since the disappearance at the end of last year of Mr. Georgi Gongadze, a journalist who was critical of President Kuchma and of corruption in Ukrainian society. What is believed to be Mr. Gongadze's headless body was found last November and secret tapes appear to implicate President Kuchma in his disappearance and death. President Kuchma denies any involvement but the whole episode has brought protest onto the streets of Kiev.</P>
      <P>There is serious concern on the part of the Council of Europe at the situation in Ukraine, notably in regard to the honouring of its obligations and commitments which continue to be monitored by the Council's Parliamentary Assembly. On 26 April, the assembly adopted a recommendation again setting out its concerns and calling on Ukraine to fulfil its commitments, including the establishment of a framework in which the Ukrainian media can operate. The Ukrainian authorities have been called upon to stop any practices of pressure against the media and to achieve speedy and transparent investigation into cases of violence against journalists. The assembly has decided that, unless substantial progress is achieved by June, it will consider recommending that the suspension of Ukraine from the Council of Europe should be considered by the committee of ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the assembly's concerns on the situation in Ukraine, notably fulfilment of its commitments regarding freedom of expression. I fully support the decision of the Committee of Ministers on 18 April to keep the question of respect for the rule of law, pluralist democracy and human rights in Ukraine on its future agenda. The creation of a pluralist and fully democratic society in the Ukraine can only be achieved with the full commitment of the Ukrainian authorities to the creation of a free press, which is a crucial component in any democracy. The Council of Europe has an important contribution to make in assisting Ukraine to develop a range of free, independent and pluralistic media. I welcome the fact that a plan of action has been worked out to set up and apply a regulatory framework for the media in keeping with the relevant instruments of the council, particularly Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and relevant case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. This assistance cannot, however, be provided other than with Ukraine as a member of the Council of Europe. While I appreciate and share <Col N="1540" /> the concerns of the Parliament, I remain for that reason doubtful that an appropriate response to the present situation would be the suspension of Ukraine from the organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is adamantly opposed to the use of the death penalty and accordingly seeks its universal abolition. We believe that its abolition contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights.</P>
      <P>This commitment is reflected in the Government's proposal to amend Articles 13.6, 40.4.5, and 28.3.3 of the Constitution. Following the recommendations of both the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution and the report of the constitutional review group, these amendments would involve withdrawing all present references to capital punishment and drafting a new provision expressly prohibiting its use.</P>
      <P>In June 1998, common guidelines for European Union initiatives on the issue of the death penalty were agreed and adopted by EU Foreign Ministers. These guidelines now form the basis for Ireland's concerted interventions, along with other EU member states, in death penalty issues. The Government is strongly of the view that an EU intervention carries significantly greater force than individual bilateral interventions by national Governments.</P>
      <P>The guidelines state that, where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted and for moratoria to be introduced. In addition to interventions on the use of the death penalty in principle, it has also been agreed that, where the facts of individual cases suggest a violation of basic minimum standards under international law, the Union will consider making a specific intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the adoption of the guidelines, the EU has pressed for abolition and has also issued <i>démarches</i> on the use of the death penalty in a number of countries, including the United States. In February 2000 a general <i>démarche</i> was made by the EU in which the US was called upon to withdraw its reservation to Article 6 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, concerning the prohibition on imposing the death penalty on minors. This was accompanied by a presentation to the US federal and state authorities, of a memorandum presenting an overview <Col N="1541" /> of the principles, experiences, policies and alternative solutions guiding the abolitionist movement in Western Europe. In July 2000 Ireland was fully associated with a further EU <i>démarche</i> when it appeared that the <i>de facto</i> moratorium on federal executions in the US would be ended.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been and will continue to be active in international human rights fora in relation to the death penalty. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the EU-sponsored resolution on the question of the death penalty was adopted following a vote at the recently concluded 57th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned by the unfolding tragedy in Turkish prisons. To date more than 20 hunger strikers have died and up to 50 more are in a critical condition. My Department is receiving daily situation reports from our embassy in Ankara and from other sources. The Irish ambassador to Turkey has met the foreign minister, Mr. Cem, to raise the matter of the hunger strikers and to express Ireland's concern.</P>
      <P>In a public statement on this issue which I made on 25 April I called on the Turkish Government to continue its efforts to address existing problems and to prevent further tragic loss of life. In this regard, as a Council of Europe member, Turkey should work actively to implement the recommendations of the Council's committee for the Prevention of Torture &ndash; CPT. I also called on the prisoners and their representatives to participate as a matter of urgency in efforts to seek a solution.</P>
      <P>Last week the Turkish Parliament amended several laws clearing the way for the Government to respond to some of the prisoners' demands so that negotiations on an end to the hunger strike might begin. These legal changes will also allow the Government to implement some of the recommendations of the CPT. However, the prisoners, their representatives and Turkish NGOs continue to doubt the sincerity of the Turkish Government in its efforts to end the hunger strikes and its motives in insisting on the move from dormitory type prisons to small cell, or f-type prisons. I would urge the prisoners and their representatives to enter dialogue with the Turkish Government as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union has been actively involved in encouraging efforts to bring the hunger strikes to an end. A European Parliament delegation visited Turkey last week. It urged dialogue, saying that it did not want relations with the European Parliament and the European public to be adversely affected. It pointed out that <Col N="1542" /> every further death due to the hunger strikes would increase the concern and horror felt by European public opinion. I fully endorse that view. The issue has also been raised in the Union's political dialogue with Turkey.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of Turkey's links with the Union depends on Turkey's pursuit of political and economic reform, including the alignment of human rights standards and practices with those in force in the EU and the protection of and respect for minorities. Ireland will continue to avail of every opportunity to stress to Turkey the need to take urgent concrete steps to prevent human rights abuse and seriously to address any such incidents which occur. Ireland will consider positively any requests for assistance from the Turkish Government in this area.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to once again state where the Government stands on all acts of violence and intimidation. We condemn them utterly and unequivocally. No-one from any community in Northern Ireland has a mandate to engage in murder, violence or intimidation.</P>
      <P>With regard to those who have been forced to leave their homes, the Government condemns all attacks, whether on Catholics or Protestants, in the strongest possible terms. They are despicable acts designed at the very least to frighten and intimidate people. The Good Friday Agreement, endorsed by the people of this island, North and South, recognised the right to freely choose one's place of residence. It is imperative that this right be protected and vindicated throughout Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government wishes to see an immediate end to all acts of violence or intimidation, and calls on the perpetrators to end them forthwith. The Government also encourages any party with influence on the perpetrators to use their best endeavours to end the cowardly practice known as exiling.</P>
      <P>The British authorities have confirmed that no figures are maintained on the numbers of people actually forced to leave Northern Ireland. Statistics available relate to 'paramilitary attacks' in general, and show that in 2000, there were 152 such loyalist and 102 republicans incidents reported.</P>

      <P>On 8 January 1998, my predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, announced that the Government was examining how best to encourage and facilitate an understanding of the Battle of the Boyne and an appreciation of the environment in which it took place. Subsequently, an inter-departmental committee, chaired by a senior official of my Department, was formed with a mandate to bring forward detailed proposals for Government on the matter.</P>
      <P>In November 1999, the Government agreed, on the recommendation of the committee to: a series of interim measures relating to the accessibility of the site; the purchase, in principle, of the lands and development of the Battle of the Boyne site; ask the committee to draw up comprehensive long-term proposals for the development of the battle site; and the immediate appointment of a project co-ordinator.</P>
      <P>On 3 August 2000, the purchase of the Oldbridge Estate was completed by the Office of Public Works. The committee also engaged a firm of specialist consultants to undertake a study and report on: physical-spatial planning; infrastructure and facilities; access and circulation; site presentation; historic landscape protection; and signage and management issues.</P>
      <P>The study included a wide ranging consultation process which included the placement of advertisements in newspapers, North and South, inviting individuals and groups to make submissions to them in regard to the study. A number of information meetings were also arranged in Belfast and Derry.</P>
      <P>The consultants report is being finalised at present and I understand it will be presented to the interdepartmental committee within the next few weeks. It will then be considered by the committee who will bring forward comprehensive proposals for decision by Government .</P>
      <P>In addition to the above, the Department of Archaeology, University College Dublin was commissioned to undertake an archaeological study of the battle site, and that report will assist in the overall approach to the planning and presentation of the site.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the third meeting of the international support group for the peace process in Colombia, held in Brussels on 30 April, the Swedish Minister of State for Development Co-operation, Gun-Britt Andersson, representing the EU Presidency, reaffirmed the EU's support for the peace process in Colombia and for the efforts of the parties to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict. She noted the limited progress achieved in the negotiations to date and urged the FARC and ELN guerrilla groups to recommit themselves to the peace process. Against this background, she confirmed the EU's readiness to step up its support for the peace process by committing a total of 335 million in assistance to the peace effort, comprising Commission aid of 105 million over six years, and a further 220 million in contributions from member states during the next three years.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the EU, Minister Andersson reiterated the EU's condemnation of atrocities and other violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, primarily by the guerrillas and paramilitary groups. The EU believed strongly that an end to violence and respect for human rights and international humanitarian law were essential for progress in the peace process and as a basis for greater EU support. As a first step, all parties should work to achieve human rights and humanitarian agreements which would facilitate a reduction in violence and the creation of an improved climate for dialogue, involving the broad participation of different sectors of Colombian society.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Union noted the ongoing efforts of the Colombian Government to counteract paramilitaries and urged it to increase its efforts and to dismantle these groups by arresting, prosecuting and punishing all those involved in such activities.</P>
      <P>The EU's continued commitment to combat the production and trafficking of illegal drugs on the basis of the principle of shared responsibility was also underlined. It was necessary that all parties address the need to seek viable economic alternatives to the production and trade of drugs. However, it was important too to be aware of the potentially negative impact of some counter narcotic measures. In this context, the EU encouraged independent international monitoring of aerial crop spraying on the basis of procedures established by the Colombian authorities. The Union supported manual eradication as an effective means of dealing with illicit crop production and allowing its substitution, which would promote gainful employment while protecting biodiversity and the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same meeting, Commissioner Patten confirmed that the EU intends to contribute to building up peace on the ground through the establishment of &lsquo;peace laboratories' in conflict <Col N="1545" /> areas of the country, initially in the Magdalena Medio region. The aim will be to reinforce local institutions, support civilians engaged in promoting peace and foster economic and social development. Significant resources will also be devoted to addressing structural weaknesses undermining peace, through support for reform of the administration of justice, promotion of integrated agricultural reform and the planning and delivery of sound environmental policies. The EU will also seek to combat persistent violence and human rights violations by supporting the activities of local human rights organisations, and will work to relieve the social impact of conflict through education and re-assimilation of displaced people and by implementing alternative development in areas where manual eradication of crops takes place.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Patten said that the aim was to have EU support operational on the ground this year through commitments of up to 43 million for human rights organisations, displaced people and the first peace laboratory.</P>
    <P>In addition to financial and political backing, Commissioner Patten stressed the EU's willingness to look at other means of support, including through further trade concessions under the European system of generalised preferences, as well as closer co-operation on control of chemical precursors for narcotics, and on combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons.</P>
    <P>For its part, the Irish Government intends to make a substantial financial contribution direct to the Colombia field office of the UN High Commission for Human Rights to help ensure the continuation of its vital work in developing a culture of respect for human rights, without which peace cannot take root. The Government also proposes to co-finance, with Irish NGOs and their Colombian partners, a series of new projects in different regions of Colombia, dedicated to human rights and conflict resolution, as well as rural education and community development.</P>
    <P>In common with our EU partners, we believe that this substantial programme of support provides clear evidence of our sustained and long-term commitment to the peace process initiated by President Pastrana. In this spirit, the EU will continue to encourage all parties to end violence, engage in the peace process and work to resolve their differences through dialogue, in the interests of all the people of Colombia.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to have copies of the texts of the statements by Minister Andersson and Commissioner Patten placed in the library of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy concerning the situation in Iraq was set out in full in the statement which I made to the House on 22 March. On the specific issue of the impact of sanctions, I stated that Ireland would play an active and constructive role in the Security Council, in particular through the council's Iraqi sanctions committee. I also stated that we would support the implementation of the additional measures recommended by the UN Secretary General and others to ease the suffering of the people of Iraq by greatly reducing and eliminating the holds placed on applications for goods for humanitarian and essential civilian use.</P>
      <P>The sanctions committee is currently reviewing its activities in specific sectors. Ireland made a strong intervention at the most recent of these discussions on the unacceptable number of holds placed by the committee on core supplies required for key infrastructural sectors in Iraq. We restated our position that the economic and development needs of the Iraqi people do not have to be put on hold pending full compliance by Iraq with the Security Council resolutions and that we wished to see the system operate so as to allow these needs to be met fully within the constraints required to ensure that Iraq does not further develop weapons of mass destruction or threaten its neighbours.</P>
      <P>A full review of the sanctions regime will take place in the Security Council following the publication of the Secretary General's report expected on 28 May. This will be the first occasion in which Iraq has been formally debated since Ireland joined the Security Council and it will afford us the opportunity to set out our views on the lack of progress in a number of areas. Specifically, we will be calling for the rapid implementation of secretariat recommendations under Security Council resolutions 1284 and 1330 which would result in a major reduction and elimination in the number of contracts placed on hold.</P>
      <P>The Government continues to support a comprehensive re-evaluation of the sanctions regime on Iraq. This remains one of the main objectives of our discussions with the other members of the Security Council. From these discussions, and from my own high-level meetings in Washington, Moscow, Paris and New York, I believe that the members of the Security Council are now closer to developing a new approach to the implementation of sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, the Security Council cannot <Col N="1547" /> ignore the other aspects of the current humanitarian crisis in Iraq, in particular the increasing action of the Iraqi Government to limit and obstruct the provision and delivery of assistance to its own people.</P>
    <P>We call on Iraq to co-operate with the United Nations in administering the oil-for-food programme and to use the means available to it to alleviate the suffering of its own people as well as to help bring about the circumstances which would permit the complete lifting of the sanctions.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer questions 70 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies may be aware, the issue of free movement of workers after enlargement is at present under detailed examination at EU level. It would not be possible to predict the final outcome of that examination at this stage. From Ireland's national point of view, we could support full free movement of workers from the date of the accession of new member states. However, we recognise that some existing member states have particular problems with this and are seeking a transitional arrangement with respect to the free movement of workers. Ireland would be sympathetic to achieving a balanced compromise on this matter, which addresses the concerns of certain existing member states while, at the same time, takes into account the legitimate expectations of the candidate states. Hopefully such a compromise would prove acceptable to candidate states and member states alike.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the Government's view of the settlement of the case taken by 39 pharmaceutical companies against the South African Government over patent rights on certain drugs; the additional steps the Government intends to take to assist the fight against AIDS and HIV on the African continent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12926/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The high prevalence of HIV-AIDS infection in many African countries constitutes a major obstacle to their development. In countries such as South Africa up to 20% of the adult population are infected with HIV virus. In these situations HIV-AIDS is contributing to an erosion of hard-won development gains, it is worsening poverty and it is causing much physical and psychological suffering to individuals and communities.</P>
      <P>We know that the quality of the lives of people living with HIV can be greatly enhanced if they can access essential medications that can be used to treat opportunistic infections. We know also that the availability of such treatments can also prolong the life of those infected with this virus, and can reduce the risk of transmission of associated diseases such as TB and infectious diarrhoea. We know also that the availability of anti-retroviral drugs can prolong the life of those infected with HIV &ndash; and in many cases their administration has transformed the lives of people infected with HIV virus and allowed their illness to be controlled and their quality of life greatly improved.</P>
      <P>However, access to such medicines is not universal and from the perspective of developing countries, has been denied, not on the basis of need, but on the ability of countries' capacity to afford the prices being demanded by drug manufacturers. The recent constitutional court hearing which took place in South Africa between the South African Government and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, which represented 39 local and international drugs companies, highlighted in a very public way the rights people have to effective treatment on the one hand and the rights companies have to a protection of their patents on the other.</P>
      <P>Against the background of the extent of the HIV-AIDS epidemic in Africa and the growing international call for equity of access to effective treatments, I believe it was a major error of judgment for the pharmaceutical companies to bring the matter to the courts in the first place. Some weeks back, I made the case for this action to be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I therefore welcome the early settlement of this case and believe that the outcome of this case signals a shift in power between the rights of developing countries over a specific interpretation of international patent regulations. It is my hope that this decision will contribute to the acceleration of efforts to ensure that poor people in Africa with HIV-AIDS have access to life-saving drugs at affordable prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the outset of this epidemic, Ireland has recognised that the provision of cheaper drugs to combat HIV-AIDS is an important component of the fight against the disease. Political leadership, <Col N="1549" /> national prevention strategies and the long-term development of sustainable health systems are also vital. Ireland has pressed for the use of innovative measures to improve the supply of essential drugs. In January 2000, the Taoiseach wrote to the President of the European Commission, Mr. Prodi pressing for an accelerated EU response to the AIDS crisis, and raising the issues of access to drugs for poor countries. We have continued to press this issue at EU level and measures to improve the supply of drugs at an affordable price are a key element of the new EU accelerated action policy to combat HIV-AIDS.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department has a substantial commitment to contributing to the reduction of HIV-AIDS through the Ireland Aid programme. In our statement to the Security Council last January, we called for an intensification of efforts by the UN bodies, the drugs industry and other relevant organisations to address the complex issues that militate against making effective medications accessible to poorer countries.</P>
    <P>As part of that commitment I urge a greater degree of dialogue between the international community, developing country governments and the pharmaceutical industry to make effective medications more available to poorer countries at prices that are affordable. I assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to engage with, and provide financial support for, efforts that will result in the provision of effective treatments for those living with HIV-AIDS in poorer countries.</P>
    <P>Next month the UN special session on HIV-AIDS will be held in New York. The meeting will serve to galvanise international efforts to respond to the AIDS pandemic. The Taoiseach will lead the Irish Delegation to this Special Session. His presence at this meeting, together with that of my colleague Liz O'Donnell signifies in a very tangible way the commitment of this Government to continue to support international efforts to prevent and control this global disease.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that a new global fund for HIV-AIDS will be established following the UN special session. Such a fund will further facilitate the purchase of medications for people living with HIV-AIDS in poorer countries. Our Government will participate in discussions governing the establishment of such a fund and with a growing aid budget, will be in a position to consider making additional contributions to the global fight against HIV/AIDS.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 73 of 28 March.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in that reply, I am not aware of any current proposal to integrate the Western European Union into the EU. The modalities to facilitate the transfer of certain crisis management functions of the Western European Union into the EU, as agreed in principle by the Council of Ministers during the French EU Presidency, remain under discussion. I look forward to examining the Belgian Presidency's work programme in more detail when it becomes available.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the overall objective of the European security and defence policy, including the transfer of the Petersberg functions of the Western European Union, is to enhance the conflict prevention and crisis management capabilities of the EU. This objective is fully consistent with Ireland's policy of military neutrality, to which the Government remains firmly committed.</P>

      <P>The second meeting of the European Council under the Swedish Presidency will take place in Gothenburg on 15 and 16 June. The Presidency has yet <Col N="1551" /> to brief partners on their specific intentions for the meeting which, as a formal session of the European Council, may consider issues from across the entire range of the Union's activities. However, recent indications from the Presidency are that the major issues for Gothenburg will be enlargement, sustainable development and European security and defence policy, in addition to topical external relations items. There may also be some discussion on the future of Europe issue.

      <P>The Universal Declaration on Human Rights states that &lsquo;No-one shall be held in slavery or servitude: slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.' Full adherence to the absolute values enshrined in the Declaration is of paramount importance. The concept of slavery has broadened from the traditional concept of the slave trade and now includes practices such as bonded labour.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards, including opposing and seeking the elimination of all forms of bonded labour. We voice our concerns, wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries, in international fora such as the UN general assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts to eliminate contemporary forms of slavery involve a wide spectrum of international organisations, NGOs and Governments. The working group on contemporary forms of slavery, an inter-sessional working group of the sub-commission on the promotion and protection of human rights, is the UN body which has responsibility for the study of all aspects of slavery. At its <Col N="1552" /> 25th session in June 2000 in Geneva, it devoted priority attention to the question of bonded labour and debt bondage.</P>
    <P>Ireland has provided financial assistance to the UN voluntary trust fund on contemporary forms of slavery, which was established by the UN general assembly in 1991 with the purpose of assisting NGOs dealing with contemporary forms of slavery to participate in the deliberations of the working group on contemporary forms of slavery and to provide assistance to individual victims of contemporary forms of slavery.</P>
    <P>Resolutions at the UN which address aspects of contemporary forms of slavery have been co-sponsored by Ireland. For instance, at the recently concluded session of the third committee, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution on &lsquo;Traffic in women and girls', which, <i>inter alia,</i> reaffirmed that trafficking in women and girls, a contemporary form of slavery, is a serious violation of human rights. Trafficking in human beings is, of course, also a serious crime and as such the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for aspects of the issue. At a domestic level, Ireland has recently taken concrete steps to address the issue of trafficking with the enactment of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000, which creates for the first time the criminal offence of trafficking.</P>
    <P>The protection and promotion of the human rights of all human beings is the first responsibility of every government. Contemporary forms of slavery, a most fundamental abuse of human rights, are being addressed in different fora and the Government is committed to supporting efforts to eliminate all forms of slavery.</P>

      <P>This longstanding case involves a claim by Ireland for compensation from Germany in respect of the bombing of an Irish vessel, the MV <i>Loch Ryan</i>, by German war planes off the coast of Cornwall on 16 August 1940. The case has been taken up with Germany at intervals over the years and on three occasions in the past six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department carried out a detailed study of the case in the second half of last year and a comprehensive submission was prepared for my consideration, following on from which the Irish Ambassador in Berlin met with a senior official in the German Foreign Ministry on 28 February last. At this meeting the Ambassador explained in detail the <Col N="1553" /> elements of the Irish claim and pressed for compensation from the German Government for the family of the late owner of the vessel. The outcome of the meeting of 28 February was conveyed orally to the representative of the family concerned and a comprehensive account of the exchange of views at the meeting has been sent to him by my Department and copied to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence of a disposition to change in the German position and, in light of this, the prospect of an admission of responsibility by Germany at a future time must be considered unlikely. Moreover there is no international legal forum before which Germany can be compelled to appear in this case. For these reasons, further pursuit of the claim does not hold out the prospect of achieving a positive result. I can assure the Deputy and the family of the late owner of the MV <i>Loch Ryan</i> that it is very much regretted that it has not been possible to achieve a satisfactory outcome to this case.</P>

      <P>Female genital mutilation, FGM, is a widespread and long standing tradition in communities in parts of Africa, the Middle East and south east Asia. Although it is associated with countries which have a strong Moslem tradition, it is not an exclusively Islamic practice. It occurs also in immigrant communities in North America and Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1554" /> According to WHO, up to 130 million women and girls have undergone genital mutilation worldwide &ndash; and at least two million girls are at risk of genital mutilation each year. There is no medical indication for the practice and it is frequently carried out by persons with no training. It frequently leads to serious physical and psychological problems for women who have undergone it &ndash; in a substantial number of cases it is implicated as a direct cause of serious illness and death.</P>
    <P>The continued practice of FGM is a serious international issue which should be the concern of women and men who believe in equality, dignity and fairness to all human beings.</P>
    <P>FGM is a complex issue closely related to the cultural, social, religious, and gender relationships of a society. Condemnation of this practice requires both an understanding of this multifaceted complexity, and a recognition of the need to redress the extent that it infringes universally recognised rights of women and children on whom it is practised.</P>
    <P>FGM is just one manifestation of gender based human rights inequalities which are prevalent in many societies and which compromise the physical, psychological and sexual rights of women. It is important to recognise also that efforts to curtail FGM cannot be viewed in isolation to other efforts that address the many forms of civil, political, social and economic injustice that women suffer worldwide.</P>
    <P>The Government, through its commitment to UN declarations and agencies, demonstrates a strong commitment to advancing the social and economic development of women. This commitment is given further expression through support for specific programmes for the advancement of women in developing countries, financed through Ireland Aid.</P>
    <P>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights underscores the obligation of states to respect basic human rights, such as the right to physical and mental security, freedom from discrimination on the basis of gender and the right to good health.</P>
    <P>The 1994 UN International Conference for Population and Development in Cairo emphasised the interconnections between reproductive health and human rights. Its Programme for Action urges governments to put a stop to the practice of FGM and put in place programmes for education and rehabilitation. The World Health Organisation, which receives considerable voluntary contributions from my Department, has a long history of addressing FGM from the perspective of the right of women and girl-children to the highest attainable standard of health.</P>
    <P>The UN Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, CEDAW, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1979, defines what constitutes discrimination against women and outlines an agenda for national action to end such discrimination. There are at present 166 states parties to CEDAW, <Col N="1555" /> including Ireland which ratified the Convention in 1985.

    <P>FGM has been recognised as a form of violence against women in the UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women and in the UN Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. In June last year, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue led the Irish delegation to the Special Session of the UN General Assembly on the five year review of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action which were adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995.</P>
    <P>At Beijing + 5, member states adopted by consensus a document entitled Further Actions and Initiatives to implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. The document deals in some depth with the issue of FGM and notes that while an increasing number of countries have introduced legislation to ban FGM, the practice continues to be widespread. The document calls upon governments to develop, adopt and fully implement laws and other measures to eradicate FGM and other violations of the human rights of women. The Government fully subscribes to this approach.</P>

      <P>A UN supervised ceasefire has been in effect in Western Sahara since 1991. This followed the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 690 which established a special UN mission, MINURSO, to organise a referendum to decide the area's future. There has been little progress in the holding of this referendum due to ongoing disputes between the parties concerning the registration process.</P>
      <P>The mandate of MINURSO was extended by the UN Security Council for a further two months on 30 April.</P>
      <P>When the mandate was last renewed, on 27 February 2001, the two-month extension was intended to give Morocco further time to come forward with a proposal for substantial autonomy as a basis for negotiations towards a political solution and to break the impasse on the implementation of the UN settlement plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Secretary General, in his report of 25 April, stated that &ldquo;substantial progress has been made toward determining whether (Morocco) is prepared to offer or support some devolution of authority that is genuine, substantial and in keeping with international norms.&rdquo;  The Special Representative of the Secretary General, Mr. James <Col N="1556" /> Baker, is to hold discussions with the parties to the conflict to see if these proposals can serve as a basis for progress.</P>
    <P>Following the renewal of the MINURSO mandate, the President of the Security Council issued a statement to the press expressing the concern of the Council that there has been no further progress in the release of prisoners of war.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to support the UN settlement plan and the holding of the referendum. However, we realise that the advancement of the settlement plan is proving extremely difficult. In our view, for any alternative proposal to be acceptable to the Security Council, it must take due account of the legitimate concerns of both sides.</P>
    <P>The compelling humanitarian case for the release of all prisoners of war has been clearly made. The Government believe that further progress on this issue should not be dependent on the outcome of the wider political negotiations. In our view, progress on this issue would be an important gesture of good faith in the efforts to find a settlement.</P>
    <P>It is vital that all parties to the conflict respect the ceasefire agreement, co-operate fully with the UN mission and avoid provocative action.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the proposals to which he refers are contained in an internal discussion document under consideration by German Chancellor Schröder's SPD party and do not, of course, represent German government policy. Nevertheless, I welcome any contribution to the emerging debate on the future development of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has as its basis the Declaration on the Future of the Union agreed at the Nice Euro<Col N="1557" /> pean Council last December. That declaration highlighted a number of questions which would be addressed in advance of a future intergovernmental conference in 2004. These questions include the division of competences between national and EU authorities; the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights; the simplification of the EU Treaties to make them more accessible to the public; and, the role of national parliaments in the EU framework.</P>
    <P>This list was not intended to be exclusive, and a range of proposals aimed at improving the operation of the Union are expected to be put forward. An overriding aim will be to increase public understanding of European Union structures and procedures.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that already significant contributions have been made to the debate by the Belgian, Finnish and British Prime Ministers, among others, while the Taoiseach outlined the Government's views on these issues in his address to the European Movement on 6 November last.</P>
    <P>In this regard, while the Government are naturally focused, for the moment, on the important task of ratifying the Treaty of Nice, we look forward to bringing forward proposals in the near future for organising a national debate on the future of Europe, and will be seeking views and dialogue with as wide a range of public opinion as possible. This national debate will feed into a Europe-wide consultation which will include national governments, and national and European parliamentarians. The candidate countries will also play an important role in the process. The form this &lsquo;structured-consultation' will take is yet to be decided. The future Belgian Presidency is expected to bring forward proposals as to the precise arrangements for structuring the discussions, and these will be considered at the Laeken-Brussels European Council in December 2001.</P>
    <P>The Government is ready to consider all the various suggestions made in this debate, while noting that there appears to be widespread recognition of the need to maintain the broad institutional balances which have characterized the Union from its inception, and that there is little support for proposals for a federal super state.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to the replies I gave previously on 20 and 22 March, 11 April and 1 May to related questions from Deputies Spring, Durkan, Gregory, O'Sullivan, Lawlor and Owen concerning the Government's position on the tragic situation in Algeria.</P>
      <P>The UN Commission for Human Rights is the appropriate forum within the UN system for raising this issue. However, as I pointed out in my previous replies, there continues to be insufficient support within the Commission for the adoption of a resolution to establish an independent body or special rapporteur to enquire into the atrocities which have taken place as a result of the civil conflict in Algeria. In the face of the continued opposition of the Algerian authorities, it would have been counterproductive were such a resolution to have been proposed at the last session of the Commission only to be heavily defeated in divisive circumstances. Such a defeat would only have benefited the hardliners and would have sent an entirely wrong signal as to the progress we wish to see in Algeria.</P>
      <P>The EU Presidency delivered a strong statement at the Commission on Human Rights, under agenda item 9, concerning the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, in which we outlined our concern at human rights abuses in Algeria. The EU urged the Algerian Government to take concrete measures to combat extrajudicial executions, disappearances, torture and arbitrary detention and to bring those responsible to justice. The EU reaffirmed its commitment to a comprehensive dialogue with the Algerian authorities and encouraged the government of Algeria to further its dialogue with human rights NGOs. The EU stated that it will follow closely the activity of the newly created national commission in Algeria for the promotion and protection of human rights.</P>
      <P>The EU will continue to urge Algeria to cooperate fully with the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions, and to respond positively to their requests to visit Algeria.</P>
      <P>These issues were also raised directly with President Bouteflika and Foreign Minister Belkhadem in the course of the recent Ministerial visit by the EU Troika to Algiers on 24 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress in the area of human rights is a major objective of Ireland's bilateral relations with Algeria. The Government has expressed its deep concern at the horrendous loss of life and the human suffering caused by the civil conflict. We are very concerned at the continuing serious deterioration in the security situation and in particular at the violent clashes which have occurred <Col N="1559" /> in recent weeks in the mainly Berber region of Kabylia.</P>
    <P>We continue to take every appropriate opportunity in our bilateral contacts and through the process of dialogue between Algeria and the EU, to urge the Algerian authorities to take the necessary steps that will lead to an ending of the conflict, and for the establishment of independent mechanisms for the investigation of human rights violations and for bringing those responsible to justice.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that Mr. Patrick Dodson, a highly respected and widely admired leader of Australia's Aboriginal community, raised a number of issues in a letter which he sent to me in early December of last year, following a visit to Ireland.</P>
      <P>In his letter Mr. Dodson asked for the understanding and support of the Irish Government for a number of issues and concerns of the Aboriginal people, as well as for the reconciliation process within Australia. As the Deputy is aware, Australia is a country with which we have an exceptionally close relationship which is based on the special bonds of history and kinship which unite our two peoples. There is a higher proportion of people of Irish descent within the Australian population than in any other country in the world. Mr. Dodson is among those eminent Australians who has frequently referred to his Irish heritage. I can assure the Deputy, in view of these and other considerations, that we fully support the reconciliation process within Australia which I feel, in the light of our own experience as a people, can be most effectively achieved through dialogue and discussion as well as through mutual acceptance and genuine parity of esteem.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my separate responses to questions tabled relating to the situation in West Papua, Israel, Zimbabwe, Turkey, Colombia, Iraq, Western Sahara, Algeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chechnya, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Serbia, Kosovo, Albania, Afghanistan, East Timor, Myanmar, Rwanda, Eritrea and Somalia.</P>
      <P>Human rights are a priority of this Government and a central component of our foreign policy. In co-operation with our EU partners and other concerned States, the Government continually monitors the human rights situation in many countries throughout the world. We believe the international community has an obligation to act when it has concerns, and that these concerns should be pursued whenever possible in a constructive spirit of co-operation and dialogue, conscious of the responsibility which devolves on all governments to promote and protect human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has commented publicly on many occasions on those situations which give rise to grave concern, in a national capacity and as a member of the EU and the Council of Europe. These concerns have also been raised on a consistent basis by this country's representa<Col N="1561" /> tives at the UN General Assembly and at the UN Commission on Human Rights. Ireland plays an active role in the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly and closely co-ordinates with EU partners in identifying priorities and strategies for human rights issues. At the recently concluded session of the Third Committee, the EU sponsored resolutions on the human rights situations in Sudan, Iran, Iraq and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, all of which were adopted by vote. Ireland also co-sponsored Sweden's resolution on the human rights situation in Burma. In addition, Ireland's resolution on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance was adopted by consensus. Ireland will also be closely concerned with human rights issues at the UN Security Council, on taking up our seat in January 2001.</P>
    <P>Concerted international pressure applied through multilateral organisations such as the EU, UN and the Council of Europe is one of the most effective means of combating human rights abuses. However, despite the efforts of the global community in international and regional fora, it has to be acknowledged that the systems in place for preventing and tackling flagrant human rights abuses do not always prove adequate. Reasons for this range from the failure of states to ratify relevant international instruments to a lack of resources and even political will to focus on these problems.</P>
    <P>Ireland is actively engaged in the discussion of specific issues with like-minded countries, notably in a group known as the Human Security Network. This initiative of the Canadian and Norwegian Governments is aimed at establishing the principle of human security as a central element in the international community's approach to situations of conflict.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards. We will continue to voice our concerns, wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries, in international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE and the UN Security Council on taking up our seat in January 2001.</P>

      <P>Ireland's official development co-operation programme, Ireland Aid, is grounded on genuine respect for human rights and endeavours to ensure that the entire programme is imbued with an awareness and sensitivity towards the promotion and protection of human rights.</P>
      <P>Ireland Aid takes a holistic approach to addressing the issue of human rights within its development co-operation programmes. The centrality of economic, social and cultural rights, as well as civil and political rights, to all development efforts is not only acknowledged by Ireland Aid but is actively pursued within its programmes. As the primary focus of the Ireland Aid programme is poverty reduction, Ireland Aid actively works to promote socio-economic rights through provision of basic needs, while it also endeavours to cultivate and encourage an environment which respects and vindicates personal and political freedoms.</P>
      <P>In recent years Ireland Aid has taken the active approach of explicitly mainstreaming human rights, democratisation and governance activities into its programmes in the six bilateral priority countries and in South Africa. Issues relating to human rights now form an element of the policy dialogue process which is undertaken with partner countries. Ireland Aid's strong human rights culture is clearly reflected, for example, in the prominence given to partnership and participatory approaches with bilateral country programmes. Ireland Aid's area based programmes have long been distinguished for their participatory approaches and community based development.</P>
      <P>Ireland Aid also operates a separate human rights and democratisation scheme, with a broad objective to assist the development of democratic processes and institutions and the promotion and protection of human rights in developing countries. This is done mainly through support for relatively small scale projects which contribute to training and capacity building, particularly at community level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the particular organisation referred to by the Deputy my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, met representatives of the Human Rights Council of Australia last October. During that meeting the HRCA outlined its particular approach to development co-operation. Recently a representative of the HRCA met officials from Ireland Aid. At these and other meetings with the HRCA the central role played by human rights within Ireland Aid was elucidated and it was highlighted that one of the issues being considered by the Ireland Aid review committee, chaired by the Minister of <Col N="1563" /> State, is the entire area of human rights as a horizontal issue in development. An interest was also expressed to the HRCA in engaging further in the ongoing debate on the most appropriate and effective role for the promotion and protection of human rights within development co-operation.</P>

      <P>Further to its commitment to meet the UN overseas development assistance target of 0.7% of GNP by the year 2007, the Government has appointed a 15 person Ireland Aid review committee chaired by the Minister of State with special responsibility for overseas development assistance and human rights, Deputy O'Donnell. The committee has been tasked by the Government to examine and assess the future role and management of Ireland Aid in responding to humanitarian crises and in helping to advance the objectives of poverty alleviation, sustainable development and the integration of developing countries into the world economy. The committee held its inaugural meeting on 13 February when it had an opportunity to consider various aspects of the current aid programme and the policy and management challenges posed by its expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planned fourfold expansion of Ireland's overseas aid budget, to a figure in the region of £800 million by the year 2007, will require considered and prudent management, both politically and administratively. The Government wishes to <Col N="1564" /> consolidate and progress the past and internationally recognised successes of the aid programme while, at the same time, ensuring that Ireland's overseas development assistance does not merely become cheque book driven. It is hoped that the review committee can make a number of key recommendations which will help to ensure that the aid programme not only does more but does more better. These will, under the committee's terms of reference, relate <i>inter alia</i> to strategic priority policy areas, geographical range, social and economic development, agriculture and rural development. They will also relate to a number of horizontal issues, including human rights, good governance, gender equality, peace building and conflict prevention, sustainability, HIV-AIDS and meaningful local participation.</P>
    <P>At the same time there is the underlying objective of creating greater public ownership of the Ireland Aid programme and greater public identification with its objectives and achievements. The review will examine how this might be attained through a meaningful dialogue between Ireland Aid, the Oireachtas, the Irish people, NGOs, aid workers, missionaries, the private sector and other stakeholders &ndash; possibly by drawing on the successes of existing partnership models. In addition to considering the strategic and policy issues, the review committee will also make recommendations on the management and organisational structures which will be required to make the Ireland Aid programme expand in the most effective and accountable manner.</P>
    <P>To date the Ireland Aid review committee has, through a series of initial meetings and presentations, considered the views of the Ireland Aid advisory committee, the National Council for Development Education and the Agency for Personal Service Overseas. It has also had meetings with Irish NGOs, such as Dóchas, Concern, Trócaire, Goal, Self-Help Development International and the Irish Missionary Union, and is set to continue this consultative process. This week, in addition to a plenary and a drafting meeting, the committee will meet the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. The review committee is continuing its work and is determined to give adequate consideration to all relevant matters, as befits the scale of the Government's commitment to a meaningful expansion of the Ireland Aid programme, and hopes to report its findings later this year.</P>
    <P>Following the advertised 30 April closing date for the making of public submissions to the Ireland Aid review, the committee is now reviewing the opinions and insights which have become available to it by this means. To date it has received around 300 written submissions. These range in scope from full overviews of the aid programme to sectoral inputs and letters raising individual concerns. The review committee is actively considering all of these submissions and identifying the various issues which they raise as an input into the review process. The Government deeply appreciates the effort made by those <Col N="1565" /> who have made submissions as a meaningful contribution to shaping the future of the Ireland Aid programme.</P>
    <P>The Ireland Aid review is a participative process which is intended to leave a lasting legacy of best practice and effective delivery of Ireland's overseas development assistance. This commitment to quality is matched by the Government's commitment to expand the Ireland Aid programme and to meet UN and other internationally agreed development goals and objectives. This is being done with an unwavering focus on those who need humanitarian and development aid most and on those who will continue to suffer because of natural or man-made disasters.</P>

      <Quest>the aid Ireland gives to Angola either bilaterally or through non-governmental organisations; and the actions he has taken to highlight the appalling plight of thousands of Angolans who are starving and are living in camps having been forced to leave their home due to the continuous state of war.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations currently estimates that over one quarter of the Angolan population of 13 million is dependent on international aid for survival. This Government is alarmed at the protracted humanitarian crisis in Angola. This is heightened by the ongoing fighting in many areas of the country which continues to undermine humanitarian relief efforts and effective delivery of assistance to significant numbers of vulnerable people.</P>
      <P>This Government's humanitarian response to the crisis in Angola is twofold &ndash; the provision of emergency assistance supplemented by the continuation of small scale development assistance through NGOs. In 2000 this combined assistance totalled over £1,306,000.</P>
      <P>So far this year Ireland Aid has allocated £1,073,000 in emergency humanitarian aid to Angola. This includes allocations to the Irish NGOs, Concern and GOAL, for projects dealing with health, sanitation and emergency agricultural assistance for war affected populations. Further grants were made to the World Food Programme for the distribution of food assistance and to UNICEF for a health and nutrition project. A grant was also made to the Halo Trust for a mine clearance project in Kuito, Bei Province. This project will clear 80,000 square metres for the urgent and safe accommodation of internally displaced persons.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 the European Community Humanitarian Office, on behalf of member states, has provided over 125 million in Angola. This money continues to support humanitarian programmes in the areas of nutrition, food security, water and health needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In late March Ambassador Richard Ryan, <Col N="1566" /> Ireland's permanent representative to the United Nations in New York, visited Luanda, the capital of Angola. He discussed the humanitarian crisis affecting the Angolan population. He also spoke of the need for the Angolan Government to invest its increasing revenues from natural resources in programmes to rebuild Angola for its people.</P>
    <P>Along with its ongoing efforts to support peace and human rights observance in Angola, Ireland also chairs the UN Security Council committee on sanctions against UNITA. This is an international instrument intended to end the cycle of conflict in Angola. Through this and other initiatives, the UN and the Security Council hope to achieve the necessary momentum for the people of Angola to determine their future through a peaceful political resolution of the current conflict.</P>

      <P>Yes, I still feel that diplomatic representations abroad are best served by career diplomats. It is therefore not my intention to consider changing the present system of selecting members of the Irish foreign service.</P>
      <P>Irish diplomatic officers are expected to promote the full range of Irish interests overseas with particular focus on our political and economic interests. It is therefore desirable that they have a wide range of diplomatic experience, a detailed knowledge of all relevant policy areas and an ability to work effectively in a foreign environment.</P>
      <P>I recognise that many Irish people in the private sector, including those in the business community, make a significant contribution to promoting Ireland's interests overseas in their own particular sphere of activity. There is already close co-operation between such business people and embassies to which I attach considerable importance. The knowledge and skills necessary to perform effectively the full range of duties of a diplomatic officer are best acquired through a career in the foreign service. For this reason, I do not propose to change the practice of successive Irish Governments of selecting for appointment as ambassadors from among our professional diplomats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The promotion of Ireland's economic interests abroad is a primary objective of our overseas missions. In this context I attach the highest importance to effective and focused co-operation between our ambassadors and the agencies with responsibility for promoting our economic <Col N="1567" /> interests. One way in which this co-operation has been achieved in several locations is through the Ireland House concept. In addition, representatives of Enterprise Ireland are attached to the staff of a number of diplomatic missions.  </P>

      <P>Correspondence as referred to by the Deputy was received in my Department on 19 April 2001. The matter raised concerns a dispute in relation to the method of payment of wages of certain employees and the procedure for dealing with such disputes was outlined in a response from my Department which issued on 26 April.</P>
      <P>The Payment of Wages Act, 1991, established a range of rights for all employees in relation to the payment of wages, including the right to a readily negotiable mode of wage payment. The Act specified a range of legally acceptable modes of wage payment which include cheque, bank draft, postal-money order, credit transfer and cash.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the 1991 Act repealed the Truck Acts, 1831 to 1896, and the Payment of Wages Act, 1979. Transitional arrangements were applied to employees who were paid their wages in cash immediately before the coming into operation of the Act on 1 January 1992. These employees were entitled to continue to get their pay in cash until such time as they came to an agreement with their employer to be paid in some other legally acceptable form.</P>
      <P>Any breakdown in such an agreement, or dispute arising thereon, falls to be settled either through direct negotiations between the parties involved or through recourse by them to the State's industrial relations dispute settlement machinery as provided for under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 1990.  </P>

      <P>The area of genetic testing is one in which developments are taking place at a very rapid pace. I am aware that many people have concerns about the issue of genetic test results and how they might impact on the availability to them of life insurance cover in general.</P>
      <P>I am therefore glad to be able to report on a positive development in this area. The Irish Insurance Federation recently produced a code of practice for its members. The issuing of the code followed consultation by the IIF with interested parties including the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation as well as officials from the insurance division of my Department.</P>
      <P>The code includes the following provisions: insurance companies will not require those proposing for life assurance to undertake genetic tests; and there will be a moratorium on the requesting by insurance companies of the results of genetic tests, except in certain cases such as general life assurance cover of over £300,000 and critical illness and permanent health cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The code is a practical attempt by the industry <Col N="1569" /> to introduce a large measure of control in an area that is relatively new to everyone.</P>
    <P>The £300,000 limit on life assurance cover below which test results will not be requested is particularly welcome. The limit can be used for life cover in connection with a mortgage or otherwise, or a mixture of both, and should ensure that most people seeking life cover, including cover for mortgage protection, need not disclose any results of genetic tests.</P>
    <P>I recognise that this is in area that requires careful monitoring. My Department will pay close attention to the practical operation of the code. In addition, my Department is continuing consultations concerning wider public health issues linked to use of genetic tests by insurers and the advisability or otherwise of legislative controls.</P>

      <P>The Nice Treaty makes no material change to the status of Irish in the European Union. Irish, while not an official or working language of the Community is one of the 12 so-called treaty languages listed in Article 314 of the treaty establishing the European Community. This means that each successive treaty is published in Irish as well as in the 11 other languages, with the texts in Irish being equally authentic and having equal status with those in all other languages. An Irish language version of the Nice Treaty has been prepared in accordance with these provisions.</P>
      <P>More generally, the Amsterdam Treaty confirmed the right to correspond with the institutions of the European Union in any treaty language, including Irish. A declaration adopted in conjunction with the Nice Treaty calls for a response to any such correspondence to be made within a reasonable period.

      <P>I regard the decision on the part of the British <Col N="1571" /> Government to ratify the European Charter for Regional and Minority languages as a very welcome development. The charter has the potential to exert a very positive influence on the status of the Irish language within Northern Ireland. Its ratification is further evidence of the development of a new understanding, respect and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity which was called for in the Good Friday Agreement. That Agreement committed the British Government to undertake resolute action to promote the Irish language and, where possible, to remove restrictions which would discourage or work against the maintenance or development of the language. Among other measures in the Good Friday Agreement, the British Government agreed to place a statutory duty on the Department of Education of Northern Ireland &ldquo;to encourage and facilitate Irish medium education in line with current provision for integrated education.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Obviously the specific measures to be taken on foot of the British Government's ratification of the charter are primarily a matter for the British authorities.

      <P>It is essential that peace negotiations are resumed and that they address the central issues. Relaunching low level negotiations with very limited aims would fall short of what is required.</P>

      <P>Security measures alone are not capable of building peace.

    </Speaker>
    <P>A return to normal life will not be possible <Col N="1572" /> unless the Israeli policy of settlement, which is at the core of this conflict, ceases. Palestinians see Israeli settlement policy as a flagrant denial of the peace process. In practice it has become a direct provocation to violence. This is evidenced by the very high level of casualties in the vicinity of settlements.</P>
    <P>The achievement of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace that recognises both the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and the right of Israel to live in peace and security is the key to a better life for all the people of the region.</P>

    <P>The benefits of enlargement will be considerable. The new member states will be afforded, as was Ireland on accession to the then EEC in 1973, the chance to develop economically and politically in a stable, prosperous environment. For an open, export oriented economy such as Ireland, <Col N="1573" /> the expansion of the Single Market to over 500 million people will bring unprecedented trading opportunities. Irish companies will also undoubtedly build on their already significant investments in the applicant countries.</P>
    <P>A yes vote in the referendum on the Nice Treaty will also bring other benefits to Ireland, both direct and indirect. The treaty makes provision for valuable changes to the administration of justice by the European courts, likely to be of benefit in speeding up cases for citizens and companies. A new provision providing a treaty basis for co-operation between member states to combat social exclusion will also enter into force, a provision included in the treaty following an Irish initiative. Very importantly, a yes vote will cement our good relations with the candidate countries and ensure we continue to play a full role at the heart of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Nice Treaty also provides for further debate on the future development of the Union, leading to a further intergovernmental conference in 2004. The issues to be examined include: the division of competences between national and EU authorities; the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights; the simplification of the EU treaties to make them more accessible to the public; and the role of national parliaments in the EU framework. This list was not intended to be exclusive and a range of proposals aimed at improving the operation of the Union will be put forward as the debate develops. An overriding aim will be to increase public understanding of and support for European Union structures and procedures.</P>
    <P>Significant contributions have already been made to the debate by the Belgian, Finnish and British Prime Ministers, among others, while the Taoiseach outlined the Government's views on these issues in his address to the European Movement on 6 November. This debate is continuing and it is understood that the German paper referred to is an internal discussion document under consideration by Chancellor Schröder's SPD party and does not represent official German policy. Nevertheless, the Government welcomes any contribution to the emerging debate on the future development of the European Union.</P>
    <P>In this regard, while the Government is naturally focused, for the moment, on the important task of ratifying the Nice Treaty, we look forward to bringing forward proposals in the near future for organising a national debate on the future of Europe and will be seeking views and dialogue with as wide a range of public opinion as possible. This national debate will feed into a Europe-wide consultation which will include national governments and national and European parliamentarians. The candidate countries will also play an important role in the process. The form this structured consultation will take is yet to be decided. Belgium, as holder of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers for the second half of this year, is <Col N="1574" /> expected to bring forward proposals as to the precise arrangements for structuring the discussions and these will be considered at the Laeken-Brussels European Council in December 2001. I look forward to consulting with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs regarding the structure of the debate, nationally and at European level, in particular with regard to issues which may arise in the context of the consideration to be given to the role of national parliaments in the EU framework.</P>
    <P>The Government is ready to consider all of the various suggestions made in this debate, while noting that there appears to be widespread recognition of the need to maintain the broad institutional balances which have characterised the Union from its inception, and that there is little support for proposals which would create any form of federal super state.</P>

      <P>The cultural allocation for the Department of Foreign Affairs for the year 2000 was £810,000 and for the year 2001 it is £980,000.</P>
      <P>The cultural allocation is used to promote Ireland abroad through the medium of culture. This is done through the funding of events abroad with an Irish cultural connection, donations of Irish books, music and other cultural products to foreign bodies and institutions, the organisation of events to take place in conjunction with and give added value to State and official visits and the implementation of our cultural agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>Individuals and organisations make applications to the Department for funding of events abroad with an Irish cultural connection. The cultural relations committee reviews these applications and makes recommendations on whether grants should be given to the applicants.</P>
      <P>In 2000 the cultural relations committee made recommendations for grants to the sum of £471,090.51. This year I expect that the committee will make recommendations for grants to the sum of around £500,000.</P>
      <P>I will provide the Deputy separately with details of the grants recommended by the committee in 2000 and 2001 to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation within Sierra Leone has not deteriorated further since the signing of the Abuja Agreement of 10 November 2000. However, the Government remains deeply concerned at the continuing incursions and violence at the borders of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. With our EU and UN partners, we have called on the Governments of these three countries to end the current crisis and create conditions for peace in Sierra Leone and in the region. In this connection we strongly support the efforts by regional leaders and the United Nations mission in Sierra Leone aimed at stabilising the security situation, restoring the peace process and helping to rebuild Sierra Leone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rebel movement, the Revolutionary Armed Force, has begun to have serious and meaningful contact with UNAMSIL which has yielded some important results. These include the return of weapons seized from some UNAMSIL contingents and the reopening of roads to facilitate the free movement of people and goods in RUF held areas. The slow pace at which the RUF is implementing aspects of the Abuja Agreement and their continuing reluctance to disarm and allow the Government of Sierra Leone to extend <Col N="1587" /> its authority to areas held by the rebels raises serious doubts about its intentions.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian situation remains fragile in Sierra Leone. Reports continue to be received about the RUF allegedly harassing civilians and forcibly recruiting adults and children for fighting and forced labour. In the Security Council, Ireland has strongly condemned such activities and has supported UNAMSIL's investigation of any allegations of human rights abuses committed by other military groups, including the Sierra Leone Army and the Civil Defence Force.</P>
    <P>A recent UN Security Council resolution has extended UNAMSIL's mandate to 30 September 2001. The strength of the mission will be raised to 17,500 over the forthcoming months.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to support efforts aimed at securing lasting peace and stability in Sierra Leone and at alleviating the suffering caused to the people there by the nine years of civil war in the country. The current cessation of hostilities provides a unique opportunity for all parties to pursue confidence building measures and restore dialogue.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will give an update on the situation in Mozambique; if he has contributed or will contribute positively to the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13290/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable progress has been achieved in Mozambique over the past decade. The end of the brutal civil war and the establishment of a multi-party democracy have provided a strong basis for future political development. At the same time, the country's economy has experienced significant expansion with GDP growth rates averaging more than 10% in recent years. While disastrous weather, including severe floods, reduced that figure to 3.8% in 2000, growth rates are expected to increase again this year.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that this political and economic progress remains fragile. Mozambique's economic performance is heavily dependent upon massive inflows of international assistance. The International Monetary Fund, for example, estimates that without the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative debt relief, Mozambique's debt service ratio would have been more than 31% in 2000; with HIPC, it was just 4.4%.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned at the increase in political tension between Frelimo, the ruling party of President Chissano, and the opposition Renamo led by Alfonso Dhlakama. The current difficulties can be traced to the presidential and parliamentary elections of December 1999 which were disputed and challenged by Renamo. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the results were valid, a verdict also reached by international election observers. Mr. Dhlakama and his party never formally accepted the results and his party boycotted Parliament until October 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> These difficulties exacerbated long-standing political tensions and gave rise to several outbreaks of violence. Last November the most serious incident occurred when at least 28 people were killed in clashes between police and Renamo supporters in northern and central parts of the country. The opposition has also complained of police raids on their offices in recent months. The Government has responded by accusing Renamo of building up supplies of weapons and explosives. Renamo continues to demand more political concessions from President Chissano in exchange for its agreement to accept its opposition status. In recent months a series of negotiations aimed at ending the political tension have taken place between the President and Mr. Dhlakama. While some progress has been made at these talks, they have so far failed to resolve all outstanding matters.</P>
    <P>Along with our EU colleagues, Ireland condemned the violence that took place last November and the excesses which accompanied the demonstrations. We have made clear our strong support for the dialogue between the two main parties as the only viable way of overcoming the present political difficulties. It is essential that the considerable progress achieved since the end of the civil war is not jeopardised. We will continue to monitor developments closely and to make known our views where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Mozambique is a priority country for Ireland Aid. A total of £15.5 million has been allocated for the programme budget for 2001. The Government has provided over £1 million in emergency assistance to meet the humanitarian needs caused by extensive flooding in 2000 and 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The signing of a comprehensive peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea on 12 December 2000 brought an end to their brutal border war. The Government warmly welcomed this development and believes that the agreement provides the real prospect of lasting peace for their war weary peoples.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the terms of the agreement be fully implemented without delay. I therefore welcome the progress that has been made to date. The formal establishment of the temporary security zone on 18 April was an important development. However, I am concerned at recent indications that Ethiopia may no longer accept the TSZ as presently constituted and I am seeking clarification of the position from our embassy in Addis Ababa and from the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> Ireland has actively contributed to Security Council deliberations on the situation since becoming a member of the Council in January. Along with our EU partners, we will continue to support the peace process and promote initiatives aimed at creating long-term reconciliation between the two countries.</P>
    <P>Last month 38 people were killed and over 200 were injured when protests by students at the University of Addis Ababa escalated into violence. The Government accused opposition forces of being behind the disturbances and a number of leading opposition figures were subsequently arrested. Internal difficulties within the main governing coalition party, the TPLF, have exacerbated existing political tensions.</P>
    <P>On 27 April an EU Troika delegation met with the Ethiopian Government to express our deep concern at the violence and at reports of excessive use of force by the security forces, mass arrests and other human rights abuses. The delegation called for an investigation into the events.</P>
    <P>Along with our EU colleagues, we will continue to monitor developments closely and express our concerns where appropriate.</P>

      <P>The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor is in the process of preparing the territory for independence with elections to a constituent assembly scheduled for the end of August 2001. Work also continues across the full spectrum of requirements to develop indigenous capacity in order to deal with the questions and demands which independence will bring. While the immediate priority is for UNTAET to continue with its work to enable independence to take place at the earliest date, East Timor's requirement for further assistance, on a reduced basis, after that date is also being examined and initial planning to cater for this has already started.</P>
      <P>Ireland participates in the UNTAET mission and has been fully involved in discussions and debates on the issue of East Timor in the context of our membership of the UN Security Council.</P>
      <P>Although there have been considerable improvements in the security situation in East Timor, the continuing presence of militias in West Timor remains a threat. The large number of East Timorese refugees still in West Timor is a further problem which needs to be resolved, not least to allow those who wish to return to East Timor to participate in the elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, both bilaterally and through the EU and the Security Council, has made known to the Indonesian authorities our concerns at their failure to deal decisively with the militias and the refugee problem in West Timor. These concerns <Col N="1590" /> were highlighted most recently at the annual session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Ireland is fully committed to supporting the East Timorese people during the current phase of intense political and economic transition into and beyond independence. This commitment has been underlined by the opening of an Ireland Aid office in Dili last November by the Government to manage Ireland's bilateral programme of assistance. A transitional country strategy programme to cover the period until the end of 2002 has been developed and will provide targeted assistance to meet basic needs. Direct financial assistance which complements Ireland's other initiatives will continue to be provided to the World Bank and United Nations trust funds, as appropriate. This will be augmented by support for quick impact programmes at local level. During 2000 £1.1 million was spent by Ireland in East Timor and support in excess of this amount is anticipated for this year.</P>
    <P>Ireland, in conjunction with the EU and at the United Nations, will continue to contribute positively to the transition to independence of East Timor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations Security Council has devoted considerable attention to attempting to resolve the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Efforts to end the war have met with considerable success in recent months and there are now grounds for optimism that a peaceful resolution of the DRC conflict may finally be in prospect. The disengagement of opposing troops from front lines in eastern DRC in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1341 has proceeded well and is being observed by United Nations monitors.</P>
      <P>Three major issues now remain to be resolved. First, the parties involved in the war must draw up a timetable by 15 May for their full withdrawal from the DRC. Second, the parties must draw up plans, also by 15 May, to neutralise irregular armed groups operating within the DRC, including the forces which carried out the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Third, progress is required on the national dialogue provided for in the Lusaka ceasefire agreement to ensure that there is representative government in the DRC.</P>
      <P>The UN Secretary General has set out the challenges in the period ahead in his latest report on the United Nations mission in the DRC, also known as MONUC. As the withdrawal of foreign forces proceeds, it is envisaged that MONUC will be transformed from an observation mission into a fully fledged peacekeeping operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appalling humanitarian situation and the <Col N="1591" /> security of local populations in the areas to be evacuated by foreign forces will also require particular attention.</P>
    <P>The report of the United Nation's panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which was released in mid-April, makes a number of extremely serious allegations against countries involved in the DRC war. Rwanda and Uganda are singled out for particular criticism in relation to the mass scale looting and illegal exploitation of resources such as gold, diamonds, coltan and timber that has taken place in the DRC since the outbreak of war in 1998.</P>
    <P>The allegations are of a sufficiently serious nature to merit thorough investigation by the relevant national authorities. The Government expects the parties concerned to do so and to extend every co-operation to the panel of experts in its future work. No effort must be spared by the relevant authorities to ensure that activities which undermine the peace process in the DRC are halted and that the Congolese people can finally be allowed to benefit directly from the natural wealth of their own country.</P>
    <P>As a member of the UN Security Council, Ireland has contributed actively to efforts to end the DRC crisis. Ireland will participate in a Security Council mission to the Great Lakes region in mid-May which will assess the situation on the ground, propose concrete ways to advance the peace process, and attempt to give a boost to the holding of the interCongolese dialogue. In terms of a national contribution towards the peace process, Ireland has provided £100,000 to support the office of the facilitator of the interCongolese dialogue.</P>

      <P>The Government and the international community, including the EU and the international financial institutions, continue to monitor developments in Nigeria, particularly in the areas of poverty alleviation, economic reform and human rights.</P>
      <P>Since coming to power as the first democratically elected civilian President of Nigeria after 15 years of military rule, President Obasanjo has faced enormous challenges. The economy was in disarray and has resulted in high levels of unemployment which have exacerbated the poverty level of a large part of the population. The introduction of Islamic Sharia law in a number of states in northern Nigeria in 2000 has fuelled ethnic and religious tensions there.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomes the important steps taken by the Nigerian Government to address some of the most serious problems confronting the economy. In the areas of market reform, privatisation and the fight against corruption solid progress can be recorded. In most parts of Nigeria the human rights situation has also improved since the new civilian Government came to power.</P>
      <P>Nigeria, by virtue of its political and economic influence, population and size, has an important international and regional role to play and has, at present, a crucial opportunity to consolidate democracy and socio-economic development in its country. The European Union attaches great importance to its relations with Nigeria which, as a signatory to the ACP-EC partnership agreement signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000, is a key partner of the EU in terms of political, economic, trade and development co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the EU Ireland has urged the need to maintain a positive, constructive and consistent approach, so as to support Nigeria in its efforts to consolidate democracy and advance socio-economic development. We welcome the achievements of the Nigerian authorities to date in this regard and encourage them to maintain their <Col N="1593" /> commitment to progress in these areas, where they still face considerable challenges.</P>

      <P>The Government warmly welcomed the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement between Ethiopia and Eritrea on 12 December 2000. The agreement brought an end to their brutal border war and provides the real prospect of lasting peace for their peoples. It is essential that its terms be fully implemented without delay. I therefore welcome the progress that has been made to date. With its EU partners, Ireland will continue to support the peace process and promote initiatives aimed at creating long-term reconciliation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Eritrea is now trying to address the enormous social, economic and humanitarian consequences of the war. The main priority is to provide for the safe and co-ordinated resettlement of populations who were displaced as a result of the war. Since autumn 2000, over 55,000 Eritreans have returned from the Sudan and almost 300,000 internally displaced persons are awaiting resettlement.</P>
      <P>Eritrea is also facing a serious humanitarian situation as a result of the impact of the third year of drought. The World Food Programme estimates that several hundred thousand people are affected by the drought and that one quarter of the population may be without adequate food reserves. So far this year the Government has contributed almost £100,000 to help meet these humanitarian needs.</P>

      <P>The systematic and ongoing violation of human rights in Burma remains a matter of profound concern to the Government. The continuing refusal of the military regime to address the findings of various UN and other inquiries is unacceptable. These concerns were most recently conveyed to the military regime in the course of the EU Troika mission at the end of January and were reflected in a full and comprehensive resolution on Burma adopted at the 57th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I welcome the initial contacts that have taken place between the military regime and Aung San Suu Kyi, I note that there has been no substantive progress towards the objectives set out in the EU common position adopted during Ireland's EU Presidency in 1996. I also note that, in particular, the human rights situation in Burma <Col N="1594" /> remains extremely serious. On 9 April last, the General Affairs Council agreed to extend the common position on Burma for a further six months. I strongly supported this decision and I hope that the military regime will realise that it has to take concrete steps before the common position can be modified. I also hope that a further EU Troika mission will shortly be received in Rangoon in pursuance of the objectives set out in the common position.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the efforts of the UN Secretary General's special envoy, Tan Sri Razali Ismail, and welcome the contacts recently established between the Burmese authorities and the UN special rapporteur on human rights, Mr. Sergio Pinheiro. I hope that it will be possible for both to achieve the objectives of their mandates during future visits.</P>
    <P>The measures taken by the International Labour Organisation aimed at eliminating the unacceptable practice of forced labour &ndash; one of many human rights violations in Burma &ndash; also have the full support of the Government. Ireland, in consultation with our EU partners, has examined these measures with a view to ensuring that they are implemented to optimum effect.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of our policy to provide practical assistance where we can, and following on from the courses which took place in Ireland last year, a further training course for Burmese exiles will take place at the Institute for Public Administration next month, through the financial support of my Department. Participants will represent a range of ethnic minorities and other groups involved in the Burmese Democratic Movement and the course will be dedicated to developing skills in the areas of political leadership and public service management.</P>

      <P>Somalia has experienced a prolonged political, social and humanitarian crisis. It has been without any central government for most of the past decade and remains deeply unstable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 12 months there have been some tentative signs of progress. After numerous attempts to restore central government and end the factional fighting among the warlords, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development sponsored Djibouti peace initiative on Somalia led to the convening of a Somali national peace conference in Arta, Djibouti in May 2000. This gathering resulted in the conclusion of a tran<Col N="1595" /> sitional national charter and the establishment of a transitional 265 seat parliament in Djibouti and the subsequent election from this parliament of Mr. Abdiqassin Salad Hassan as President of the transitional national Government. Last October the new President and his Government arrived in Mogadishu and was given an enthusiastic welcome. However, the self-autonomous regions of Somaliland and Puntland, along with a number of key clan leaders refused to attend the national peace conference and do not regard the TNG as the legitimate government of Somalia.</P>
    <P>The TNG has enjoyed limited success in its attempts to assert its authority and rebuild the state. While it has achieved moderate progress in establishing the institutions of government in Mogadishu, it has little control of the country beyond the capital. Opposition to its existence from Puntland and Somaliland has hardened in recent months and a number of groups opposed to the Arta process have recently established a reconciliation and reconstruction council as a rival authority to the TNG.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomed the establishment of the TNG as offering the best prospect for peace and stability in Somalia for almost a decade. Along with our EU colleagues, we have expressed the hope that the election of Mr. Hassan as President will contribute to the restoration of the State and the preservation of national unity. We believe that an inclusive dialogue between the TNG and the two self-autonomous areas and with all relevant clan leaders is essential if lasting peace and stability is to be achieved. An EU Troika delegation visited Somalia in February and met a wide range of political and civil society leaders on all sides.</P>
    <P>Since becoming a member of the Security Council, Ireland has actively contributed to Security Council deliberations on Somalia. We have indicated that we would be open to the Secretary General's suggestion of 19 December that a UN peace building mission could play a useful role. We agree with his subsequent assessment that there would have to be a significant improvement in the security situation before such a mission could be actively considered.</P>
    <P>As a member the IGAD International Partners Forum, we have indicated our strong support for IGAD's efforts to build peace and stability in Somalia. In March we participated in the joint IGAD partners forum meeting in Rome at which the situation in Somalia was discussed in detail.</P>
    <P>I remain deeply concerned at the continued humanitarian situation in Somalia. The country remains at the bottom of the development ladder with one of the world's highest rates of illiteracy and infant mortality, extreme food insecurity and lack of primary health care. So far this year the Government has made contributions totalling £462,000 to meet the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable groups in society.</P>

      <P>Despite the political turmoil of recent years, the internal security situation in Rwanda remains relatively calm. Following the resignation of President Bizimungu, the Vice-President and Defence Minister, Paul Kagame was sworn into office as President. The new Government of National Unity has a term of four years until 2003. The Government of President Kagame has been making important efforts to rebuild the country in the aftermath of the horrific genocide of 1994.</P>
      <P>The issue of the genocide is likely to continue to dominate the political agenda in Rwanda which has been gradually rebuilding its justice system since it was almost completely destroyed in 1994. An international criminal tribunal for Rwanda was set up in 1995 under UN Security Council Resolution 995. As of April 2001, indictments had been issued against 47 individuals</P>
      <P>The conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo has had serious ethnic and security implications for Rwanda and for other countries in the Great Lakes region and in southern Africa. Rwandan troops, having helped to overthrow Zaire's late President Mobutosese Seko and put President Kabila in office, actively supported rebel factions fighting the new Government in the east of the country.</P>
      <P>The European Union has welcomed the Rwandan Government's decision to withdraw and reduce their troops in the DRC in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1341. The European Union hopes that these actions will encourage all sides to take further steps in implementing the Lusaka agreement to bring about a peaceful solution to the conflict in the Great Lakes region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the United Nations panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which was released in mid-April, makes a number of extremely serious allegations against countries involved in the DRC war. Rwanda and Uganda are singled out for particular criticism in relation to the mass scale looting and illegal exploitation of resources such as gold, diamonds, coltan and timber. The allegations are of a sufficiently serious nature to merit thorough investigation by the relevant national authorities. The Government expects the parties concerned to do so and to extend every co-operation to the panel of experts in its future work. In this context, at the open meeting of the Security Council on the report of the panel of experts on the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth in the DRC which met on 3 May, Ireland welcomed the decision of the Rwandan Government to investi<Col N="1597" /> gate allegations and to co-operate with the panel during its extended mandate.</P>

      <P>I am convinced of the benefits which accrue to the international community through the promotion of a secure and favourable international environment for trade and investment. Ireland's contribution to the Fourth Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade Organisation, which is to be held in Qatar between 9 and 13 November, and where I hope a new global round of trade negotiations will be launched, will be prepared in close consultation with our partners in the European Union. The EU will continue to promote the idea of a broad based and comprehensive round of negotiations to be completed within a relatively short period of time, say three years. Such a round should make a major contribution to global economic growth. Preparatory work for the ministerial meeting is continuing in Brussels and Geneva and Ireland is contributing to these preparations.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has primary responsibility for trade policy and promotion. Her Department will co-ordinate Ireland's preparations for and participation in the forthcoming WTO ministerial meeting, in close co-operation with the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and other Departments, as necessary.</P>
      <P>My concern is that the interests of the less developed countries should be taken into special consideration at the Qatar meeting. The European Union has recently led the way in adopting an initiative &ndash; known as Everything But Arms &ndash; which is aimed at liberalising market access for all products from the world's poorest countries, with the exception of weapons. I hope that the other major trading economies will take a lead from this. Both the industrial and middle income countries need to do more in improving market access for exports from the least developed countries.</P>

      <P>Although we have seen historic progress in the western Balkans region in the past six months, continued international support for stability, development and reform is of vital importance. Ireland is working constantly in the fora of the EU, the UN, the OSCE and the Stability Pact for South East Europe to support this process.</P>
      <P>Western Balkans issues are consistently a priority issue for discussion at virtually every meeting of EU Foreign Ministers. These discussions take place in the context of the comprehensive and integrated approach to the region launched at the EU-Balkans summit in Zagreb last November. The stabilisation and association process is designed to bring all the countries of the region into closer beneficial relations with each other and with the EU while helping with internal processes of institutional reform and development. A stabilisation and association agreement was signed with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, also known as FYROM, in April and one with Croatia is expected to be initialled in June.</P>
      <P>In the case of Albania, a high level steering group has been established with a view to assessing the readiness of that country for an agreement. It is intended eventually to have agreements with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In parallel with this initiative, an integrated aid programme, the Community Action Programme for Democracy and Stabilisation, for the region has been put in place with funding of 4.65 billion for the period 2000-06. Ireland has supported this approach throughout its development and ongoing implementation and will continue to do so. I believe this constitutes the best framework for the EU to contribute to long-term stability and growth in the western Balkans.</P>
      <P>Ireland has worked through its membership of the UN Security Council in its regular meetings on Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina to make clear that the international community will not tolerate extremist violence in the western Balkans region, and to monitor the continuing work of UNMIK, UNMIBH and the Office of the High Representative. We will continue to play an active role in this forum.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia where the situation is of particular concern at present, Ireland participated in the drafting of the UN Security Council resolution on events there adopted on 21 March. We fully support the statement of the Presidency of the EU at the weekend condemning the most recent terrorist attacks by ethnic Albanian extremists and calling for restraint by the FYROM government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also joined with my EU colleagues in condemning acts of violence by extremists in Kosovo and southern Serbia. Together, we have encouraged the high representative for the EU <Col N="1599" /> Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, in the excellent work he is performing on behalf of the EU in the western Balkans.</P>
    <P>With regard to Montenegro, I and the other EU foreign ministers have consistently underlined the need for any new constitutional arrangements to take place within the federal framework and for them to be reached through an open and democratic process. Ireland contributed seven short-term election monitors to the OSCE observation mission to Montenegro for the parliamentary elections on 22 April. Following these elections, Ireland joined its partners in calling for a resumption of dialogue between the authorities in Montenegro and in Belgrade with a view to achieving an agreed redefinition of federal arrangements that would ensure the stability of the region.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give an assessment of the situation in regard to starvation and political stability on the African continent; the extent to which the Government has used its influence at EU and UN level to bring about a stabilisation programme to deal with the issues involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Starvation, and the poverty associated with it, is a root cause of instability and conflict in Africa. In January the World Food Programme, which is the food aid organisation of the UN, presented a world hunger map. This map identifies the main regions affected by hunger around the world. As many as 830 million people suffer from hunger globally and the situation in Africa is particularly bad. The WFP has identified Sudan, Angola, Guinea and Sierra Leone as countries where major food crises loom. Regional conflicts continue to span large areas of the continent causing poverty, hunger and the displacement of large numbers of refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has been actively supporting the efforts of the UN and the EU to address the problems of hunger and political stability. Our approach has been based on tackling the root causes of hunger and instability as well as responding to immediate humanitarian crises. Through its membership of the UN Security Council and the European Union, Ireland has been intensively involved in efforts at the international level to respond to the crises in a number of countries throughout Africa. These efforts have achieved some important results. I welcome, in particular, the historic agreement reached last December between Ethiopia and Eritrea and the signs of progress evident in the protracted conflicts in Sierra Leone, the DRC and Somalia. I am pleased that we were able to make a valuable contribution in UN and EU deliberations on each of these situations. We will continue to ensure that the process of building peace and stability <Col N="1600" /> throughout Africa remains a leading priority of the international community.</P>
    <P>In addition to efforts to resolve conflict, Ireland has also contributed, both bilaterally and through the EU, to help alleviate starvation and humanitarian crises throughout Africa. In 2000 Ireland Aid provided £2,686,000 to the WFP specifically for the relief of global hunger. In Africa funding was targeted at Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Kenya and Mozambique to help alleviate starvation. This year Ireland Aid has maintained a high level of response to food crises. So far this year funding has been approved for WFP and FAO appeals totalling £2,100,000. In Africa funding will be directed to Angola, Burundi, the DRC, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sierra Leone and Sudan.</P>
    <P>These efforts to resolve conflicts and respond rapidly to food crises must be underpinned by the longer term development of the African continent. In its development policy statement, which it issued last November, the EU identified the reduction and eventual eradication of poverty as the principal aim of the Community's development policy. Africa is one of the major recipients of EU development assistance. Through its aid programme, the EU will continue to contribute to the long-term sustainable development of Africa. The reduction of poverty in Africa will help reduce conflict and will enhance political stability throughout the continent.</P>
    <P>Food security is also an important component of the anti-poverty strategies of the EU. A major study of policy in this area has recommended a number of changes to make it more effective and responsive. Through our membership of the EU's food aid committee, Ireland has been actively participating in the Union's efforts to enhance the effectiveness of its food aid and food security policy.</P>
    <P>An important initiative in the UN context to help improve global food security will be the follow-up to the World Food Summit which took place in Rome in 1996. The WFS adopted a key international target of reducing the number of undernourished people in the world to half their present level no later than 2015. The EU fully subscribes to this key international target and, in co-ordination with our EU partners, Ireland will play an active role in the follow-up to this summit which will take place in Rome in November. This summit provides a very important opportunity to review progress towards meeting the WFS target, and to renew global commitment at a political level to the task of eliminating hunger and to achieve sustainable food security.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, human security in Africa is also the major focus of Ireland's programme of bilateral development assistance.</P>

      <P>Along with the other militarily neutral and non-aligned EU member states &ndash; Sweden, Finland and Austria &ndash; Ireland is playing a full part in the development of the EU's security and defence policy, while at the same time respecting our traditions and values. In doing so, the Government remains firmly committed to Irish military neutrality and sees our involvement in the European Security and Defence Policy as fully consistent with our policy in this area.</P>
      <P>In co-operation with our European partners, we are assisting the development of both non-military and military EU crisis management capabilities. With regard to the EU military headline goal, or so-called rapid reaction force, Ireland's willingness to contribute knowledge and personnel is widely appreciated, especially in view of our considerable experience of United Nations peacekeeping missions.</P>
      <P>The development of the EU's capability to carry out Petersberg Tasks can be seen in the context of the range of instruments available to the EU including diplomatic and economic measures. The development of the EU's role in conflict prevention and civilian crisis management capabilities is of particular interest to Ireland. We are contributing actively to the overall objective of making the common foreign and security policy more effective and more visible. The EU's activities in the conflict prevention and crisis management spheres compliment the ongoing work of the UN in these areas, in which we are centrally engaged through our membership of the UN Security Council, as well as through our involvement with the OSCE.</P>
      <P>Ireland will continue to contribute actively to the elaboration of the European Security and Defence Policy with a view to influencing the direction we would wish to see it take.</P>

      <P>I have no function in relation to the offering or pricing of Internet access options by service providers. This is a commercial decision for the companies involved. I am naturally disappointed at any development that might impact on the cost of Internet access.</P>
      <P>The introduction of flat rate charges for dial-up Internet access has not been without its difficulties. To some extent this is mirroring the experience in other countries. The Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation has been engaged in an examination of these issues. Recently the director, following a public consultation, introduced new access codes and number ranges for Internet access. These dedicated Internet access codes should open the way for the development of new and innovative pricing models for Internet access and stimulate the already strong growth in Internet usage in Ireland. I encourage the operators to make use of this opportunity and look forward to the development of more choice and increased value for the consumer.</P>

      <P>Aer Rianta's profits for the years in question, as detailed in the company's annual accounts, copies of which were laid before this House, are £42.1 million in 1997, £48 million in 1998 and £31 million in 1999.

Aer Rianta funds its major investment programmes from its own resources including profits and borrowings. The company estimates that it will need to invest in the region of £100 million per annum on average over the coming years at the State airports.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for special beef premium on 19 June 2000 on 16 animals. As he did not submit a 2000 area aid application his entitlement under the premia schemes is restricted to 15 livestock units.</P>
      <P>The person named has a milk quota of 15,627 gallons which equates to 17.84 livestock units, that is 15,627 divided by the national average milk yield of 876 gallons, and exceeds his full livestock unit entitlement of 15 livestock units.</P>
      <P>Under the EU regulations governing the special beef premium scheme, all animals applied on in excess of the applicant's stocking density limit are deemed to have received the category of the premium for which they were submitted and may not be re-applied on for that same category. It is also a requirement that cattle identity cards-passports show the correct premium status of animals and, therefore, they were stamped and punched for the premium in respect of which they were submitted. The onus lies with each applicant to ensure that all applications submitted remain within their stocking density limit.</P>
      <P>Therefore, no payment is due to the person named in respect of his 2000 special beef premium application.</P>

      <P>In view of the quota difficulties arising for many producers from the foot and mouth disease restrictions, I am adopting a prudent approach on the definitive allocation of the 11.5 million gallons of additional quota under Agenda 2000, which is available from 1 April 2001. My Department is preparing a scheme which will make quota available on a temporary basis to certain producers who find themselves under serious quota pressure as a result of the FMD restrictions on animal movement. As I announced last week, strict criteria will apply to these allocations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have decided to proceed with a permanent allocation of 1,300 gallons of quota to younger farmers from the Agenda 2000 quota. This will be allocated to producers who benefited from the <Col N="1605" /> five million gallons scheme which operated last year and will bring the total allocation of the majority in this group of producers up to 3,000 gallons each from the Agenda 2000 agreement.</P>
    <P>The permanent allocation of the remainder of the 11.5 million gallons will be made when I have completed legal consultations on the possibilities open to me. I am looking, in that context, at what can be done for certain categories of development farmers.</P>

      <P>On 15 December 2000 the above named applicant applied for the special beef premium on six animals. As one of the animals was female the animal was rejected with a penalty which resulted in a 16.6% reduced payment on the remaining five animals. The <Col N="1606" /> applicant was invited to supply an explanation with supporting documentation in order that his case could be reviewed.</P>
      <P>On 9 April 2001 a letter of appeal was received stating that the animal was registered as male in the applicant's own herd in error. The error was discovered during a private test on 20 February 2001. At that stage he contacted his veterinary surgeon and arranged to amend the passport and registration. The terms and conditions of the scheme require that applicants check that each animal is a castrated male and has the correct passport when claiming the special beef premium. These conditions also require applicants to inform the special beef premium unit in writing of any errors to applications before the Department has notified the applicant of a penalty.</P>
      <P>As no new evidence was provided in the letter of 12 April, the penalty in accordance with paragraph 24 of the terms and conditions of the scheme is correct. The applicant has been informed of his right to appeal the decision.</P>

      <P>The lands in question were allotted to the persons named under a purchase agreement dated 21 December 1979. The cost of the land was £13,607 and it was to be repaid over 28 years by an annuity of £2,075.08 in half-yearly instalments of £1,037.54, the annuity rate was 15% and the interest rate was 15%. At the end of 1992 they had paid £22,190.85 by way of repayments and additionally they had arrears of £4,841.89.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special buy-out scheme was introduced by the Government in the spring of 1993 under which annuitants were allowed to redeem their annuities at a discount of 50% on the capital outstanding provided that any arrears of repayments were also paid. The amount required to avail of the scheme in the case of the persons named was £11,867.59 including the arrears of £4,841.89. They did not accept the offer and, under the terms of the scheme, their arrears of £4,841.89 were capitalised and added to the full November 1992 redemption price of £12,082.52 to give a new advance of £16,924.41, which is repayable over 28 years by a reduced annuity of £1,360.70 in half-yearly instalments of £680.35, with an annuity rate of 8.04% and an interest rate of 6.79%. At end February 2001 they had paid £9,482.10 by <Col N="1607" /> way of repayments and additionally they now have arrears of £2,083.85.</P>
    <P>The present cost of buying out this annuity is approximately £17,000 including these arrears. I have no statutory authority to write off this amount or to accept a lesser sum by way of settlement.</P>
    <P>While payments totalling £31,672.95 have been made to-date in this case, it should be noted that in effect two loans have been made and the annuity rate has been reduced from 15.25% to 8.04% thereby extending the repayment period of the second loan. The general position with annuities is that the lower the annuity rate the longer the repayment period and they are similar to house mortgages in that the amount to be repaid is inevitably more than the amount borrowed.</P>

He was also advised that as the number of rejected animals exceeded 20% of the number accepted, no payment would issue to him under the scheme. The person named appealed this decision to the independent headage and premia appeals unit where the case was fully re-examined. He was advised by letter of 23 April 2001 that his appeal was successful.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are fully aware of the particular difficulties that face the farming community at the moment because of the foot and mouth restrictions. As part of normal arrangements, Revenue would be prepared to look sympathetically at payment arrangements in individual cases where temporary cash flow problems have been experienced as a result of these restrictions. Revenue is prepared to discuss an individual case with the taxpayer concerned with a view to agreeing an acceptable approach to overcome a payment difficulty. In practice this could, for example, be an agreement to pay the liability through an instalment arrangement or accept payment in a single sum at a later date.</P>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that any taxpayer, from the farming community or elsewhere, who has difficulties in meeting tax payments for income tax or PAYE-PRSI should not ignore demands for payment but should instead make timely contact with Revenue to explain the circumstances and to settle appropriate payment arrangements.</P>

      <P>Pay and pensions increases for the grades mentioned by the Deputy are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The pensioners in question were not treated differently from other grades in the civil and public service under pensions parity policy.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the original Programme for Competitiveness and Work restructuring pay agreements, the long service increments in question for these grades were personal to certain serving staff with effect from 1 June 1996. PCW restructuring agreements for other administrative grades in local authorities provided for permanent long service increments. Under pensions parity policy, personal long service increments are not passed on to pensioners because they are not a permanent part of the pay structure whereas the permanent long service increments could be passed on to pensioners.</P>
      <P>When the long service increments in question were made permanent for serving staff with effect from 1 April 2000, they could then be passed on to pensioners under pensions parity policy in the normal way with effect from the same date. Accordingly, they were treated in the same way as pensioners who had retired from other grades in the civil and public service who did not benefit from personal long service increments under the terms of the relevant original PCW restructuring pay agreement but who may now benefit because the long service increments have been made permanent with effect from 1 April 2000.</P>

      <P>Most of the spouses' and children's schemes in question were introduced between 1968 and 1971. On the introduction of the schemes, serving staff were given the option of becoming members of the schemes. This arrangement was agreed with staff interests and was necessary because of the contributory nature of the schemes. Further options were extended to serving non-members on the introduction of revised spouses' and children's schemes. From the date of commencement of the schemes new entrants automatically become members.</P>
      <P>The spouses and children's scheme was the subject of a comprehensive review by the Commission on Public Service Pensions. The commission's final report has recently been published and I refer the Deputy to the very detailed analysis contained in it. The report indicates that the commission examined the public service occupational superannuation arrangements in the context of occupational pension schemes in the private sector and in the public sector abroad. It decided not to recommend a further membership option across the public service as a whole. It also referred to the costs involved: an estimated £103 million in accrued liabilities in respect of serving staff plus additional costs in respect of pensioners. There would also be very significant liabilities which the commission indicated it was not possible to quantify, in respect of the dependants of deceased former members.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that European Law has implications for the arrangements which were followed and which were agreed with staff interests on the introduction of the scheme. There is no reference in this regard in the commission's report.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my response to Question No. 46 on 3 April, I recognise that significant difficulties are being experienced by certain sectors of the economy as a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis and I am sympathetic to their plight. I am aware that there have been calls for assistance <Col N="1611" /> from the Government by particular sectors. However, I do not see it as appropriate to introduce general compensation measures for all sectors and individuals whose activities may be affected by the foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>
      <P>As regards some of the suggestions for temporary tax reliefs, I believe that it would be difficult to consider relieving any sector of the legal requirement to pay taxes owed to the Exchequer or agreeing any general postponement of the collection of taxes for certain sectors. The impact of the foot and mouth disease crisis has extended beyond the sectors and geographical areas most immediately affected and any general tax measures would inevitably encompass a very large number of cases. Many of these taxes such as PRSI-PAYE are collected by individual businesses on behalf of the State. Any general short-term relief would also create long-term difficulties for businesses which would have to pay both their ongoing and arrears of taxes when the crisis has abated.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are fully aware of the particular difficulties that face certain sections of the community because of the foot and mouth disease restrictions. As part of normal practice, Revenue would be prepared to look sympathetically at payment arrangements in individual cases where temporary cash flow problems have been experienced as a result of these restrictions. Revenue is prepared to discuss an individual case with the taxpayer concerned with a view to agreeing an acceptable approach to overcome a payment difficulty. In practice this could, for example, be an agreement to pay the liability through an instalment arrangement or accept payment in a single sum at a later date.</P>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that a taxpayer who has difficulties in meeting tax payments for income tax, PAYE-PRSI or VAT should not ignore demands for payment but should instead make timely contact with Revenue to explain the circumstances and to settle appropriate payment arrangements.</P>
      <P>As for individual employees who find themselves laid off as a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis, whether these individuals are employed in agriculture and related areas or in sectors indirectly affected by the crisis, such as tourism, any such employees are entitled to claim unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit as appropriate. Similarly, any farmers who are experiencing income difficulties as a result of the crisis can claim farm assist, the means-tested scheme of income support for low income farmers.</P>
      <P>In regard to these schemes, I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has ensured that any such claims within the County Louth area, which is the area most directly affected by the crisis, will be processed as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to make any change to the rate of VAT which applies to accommodation or food sales. In any event this could not be done without consideration of whether it would be permissible under EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply and the introduction of the necessary legislation to make any such changes.</P>
      <P>As regards any deferment of VAT, it would be difficult to consider relieving any sector of the legal requirement to pay VAT owed to the Exchequer or agreeing any general postponement of the collection of taxes for the tourism sector. Any such reliefs would have to encompass a very large number of cases and would invariably extend to businesses unaffected by the current difficulties in the sector. Any general short-term VAT relief would create long-term difficulties for businesses which would eventually have to pay both their ongoing taxes and arrears of taxes. I understand that in so far as particular cash flow problems arise for individual businesses Revenue does as part of normal arrangements look sympathetically at payment arrangements on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>VAT is collected by businesses from their customers on behalf of the State which does not extend any entitlement to retain such revenues as part of the daily operations of their business.</P>

Decisions in relation to grant making will fall to the designated implementation agency for each measure of the programmes. All project proposals will require to be evaluated by the implementing agency in line with project selection and assessment criteria agreed by the relevant programme monitoring committee. Final decisions on funding will fall to the designated implementation agency.</P>
      <P>The new Programme for Peace and Reconciliation was approved by the European Commission on 22 March 2001. The programme complement is currently being finalised. This document, which must be agreed by the programme monitoring committee, sets out a range of implementation issues, including the method for delivery of funds, detailed measure descriptions, and project selection criteria. This phase of development must be completed by the middle of June next and project proposals will be invited shortly thereafter. The INTERREG programme with Northern Ireland is at a preliminary stage of discussion with the European Commission and funding will not come on stream under this programme until later this year.</P>

      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, was launched in October 2000. Phase 1 of the programme has commenced in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas and offers free mammography to women aged between 50 and 64 years living in those areas.</P>
      <P>Women who attend for screening will receive their results by post within three weeks of their mammogram. Women being recalled will receive an appointment for an assessment clinic within two weeks of being notified. To minimise anxiety the programme aims to issue all invitations to arrive one or two days prior to the assessment clinic appointment. Women with biopsies will be invited back to a results clinic held not more than one week after assessment. If requiring hospital admission women will have their diagnosis fully explained by the clinician and will be offered a hospital bed within two to three weeks. A women's charter has been developed so that women will know exactly what they can expect from the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>The Report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the ombudsman's report, the expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
      <P>The provision which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of the adult sons and-or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from the 1st January, 1999. As the Deputies are aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
      <P>A group representing the Department, the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the case raised by Deputy Finucane, as the provision of health services in the <Col N="1617" /> Limerick area is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board, I have asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the case and respond to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services in County Kerry is the responsibility of the Southern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Following recommendations in the Moran Report &ndash; Review of Orthodontic Services &ndash; structural changes are being introduced into the orthodontic services. These structural changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. Additional funding of £5.3 million has been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private practitioners to treat patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board's proposals include the recruitment of two additional consultant orthodontists &ndash; one for the proposed Kerry orthodontic unit and one for the new north Cork orthodontic unit &ndash; the commissioning of four additional orthodontic chairs in the orthodontic unit in St. Finbarr's Hospital, the development of new orthodontic units in Tralee and north Cork and the validation of waiting lists. I am informed by the chief executive officer of the Southern <Col N="1618" /> Health Board that the board is currently considering a number of options in Tralee for the location of the regional orthodontic unit while seeking to recruit the consultant orthodontist for the unit.</P>

      <P>The report of the cross-departmental team on homelessness, Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy, was published in May 2000 and is currently being implemented by my Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the other Departments concerned.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the strategy are the establishment of a homeless forum in every city and county and the preparation of three year action plans by the local authorities and health boards, together with the voluntary bodies. I understand that the homeless fora have been established in all areas, save one, where the first meeting has been arranged for 17 May 2001. In the areas where the local fora have been established, work on the local action plans is progressing well. The plan for the Dublin area has already been completed and was launched on 2 May 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another key element of the strategy is the commitment that the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform each have institutions under their <Col N="1619" /> aegis and each will develop and publish strategies to prevent homelessness among those at risk leaving institutional care. My Department's preventive strategy is nearing completion and is due to be published shortly as part of an overall preventive strategy, combining the strategies of all Government Departments concerned into one composite document.</P>
    <P>The strategy also made a commitment that the Department of Health and Children would provide £6 million funding in the current year. My Department has allocated this funding to the health boards as follows:</P>

      <P>Health boards have primary responsibility for the prioritisation and delivery of capital projects within their areas under the funding indicated to them for each year of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. Individual projects will continue to be subject at various stages to approval by my Department to maximise the use of funding made available under the plan. The total costs involved in a project are subject to ongoing review over the life of the project, including inflation, phasing, scope changes, etc. In strategically managing the NDP, my Department is at present reviewing the <Col N="1621" /> plan for each board in the light of various influences affecting capital projects. These include changing service priorities, building inflation and capacity pressures in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>Given the scope of individual projects proposed under each health board's plan, and the evolving nature of capital projects in general taking account of inflation, capacity of the industry, etc., it would not be possible for me to provide the detailed information on individual projects sought by the Deputy. Should the Deputy wish to know the current position regarding the progression of individual projects, this information should be sought directly from the chief executive officer of each health board.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 171 and 172 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 22 December 1999, I approved the Dublin Port tunnel motorway scheme and environmental impact statement subject to modifications, designed mainly to prevent and mitigate environmental and construction impacts. The scheme does not include provision for the laying of fuel pipelines. The provision or laying of underground fuel pipelines, excluding gas pipelines which require consent under the Gas Acts, is development within the meaning of the planning Acts and therefore requires planning permission. Where a pipeline exceeds the thresholds in the first schedule to the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, 1999, an environmental impact assessment is also required. My Department will be participating, at the request of the <Col N="1622" /> Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, in a task force to address transport logistics in connection with ports, including Dublin port. All issues affecting my Department's brief, including environmental issues, will be monitored in this context.</P>

      <P>Under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1999 to 2001, it is a matter for the appropriate licensing authority, in this case Sligo County Council, to determine the eligibility of a person for a provisional driving licence and to issue licences. A person who makes application to a licensing authority for a first provisional licence, in any licence category, in the period 25 April 2001 to 10 June 2001 will, in the first instance, be granted a provisional licence for a limited period of 90 days. On submission to the licensing authority of a theory test certificate for the appropriate licence category the validity period of the licence will be extended for the balance of the period for which a provisional licence is normally granted. On or after the 11 June all applications for first provisional licences must be accompanied by a theory test certificate. The driver theory testing service will commence testing on 11 June.</P>

      <P>The development of the public library service is, in the first instance, a matter for library authorities. I have recently announced a new tranche of library projects which will attract grant aid with a total value of over £25 million. These projects were approved for funding on the basis of prioritised lists of library projects submitted to my Department by each library authority. In the case of Cork County Council I have approved stage 1 and stage 2 proposals for a branch library in Midleton and funding for the provision of six mobile library vehicles. The Youghal project was included in the list submitted by the library authority but with a lower level of priority and is not, therefore, included in this tranche of approvals.</P>

      <P>A preliminary report for Bandon sewerage scheme was submitted to my Department in 1993 but has not been <Col N="1624" /> approved. This scheme was included in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Cork County Council, for its southern division, in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2000-2002 announced last July. Given the level of competing demand and the limited funding available, it was not possible to include the scheme in the programme. In the interim approval was given for the refurbishment of foul and storm sewers at O'Mahony's Avenue and Bank Place, Bandon, under my Department's serviced land initiative, which will provide services to lands being developed for housing.</P>

The BIC agreed on a number of areas to be considered with a view to identifying those issues which would most benefit all members, including the development of sustainable transport policies, improved links with peripheral regions, programmes to improve road and rail safety, and practical measures which can be taken to increase <Col N="1625" /> co-operation in relation to the road transport industry.</P>
      <P>The Northern Ireland Executive is to take the lead in this area and detailed recommendations are to be prepared for work in a number of initial priority areas, which will be submitted to a further BIC meeting for approval. This framework will facilitate discussion and co-operation on matters of mutual interest in the transport area. Substantial improvements to the N2 will be carried out under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed carer's allowance in respect of her husband who is in receipt of invalidity pension, including an increase in respect of her. The application for carer's allowance was disallowed by a deciding officer in October 2000 on the grounds that the care recipient, her husband, was not in need of full-time care and attention. The person concerned appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office. At issue is the question as to whether the person being cared for requires full-time care and attention as provided for under the terms of the scheme. Further review of the medical evidence was considered necessary and, following this review the appeals officer decided that an oral hearing of the appeal should be held. Because of the number of appeals requiring oral hearing, it was not possible to arrange this before. Arrangements were made for the appeal to be heard by the appeals officer on the next visit to the area. Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the impact of the April 2000 Guidelines on Rent Supplement retained by those participating in community employment schemes, in that a person who is working for 19.5 hours per week and is participating in training faces a decreasing after-rent income, and if confronted with a rent increase, may have to choose between becoming homeless or returning to the dole; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The supplementary wel<Col N="1628" /> fare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Under the terms of the SWA scheme, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>SWA is subject to a means test. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less £6. This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Most recipients pay more than £6 towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their rent.</P>
      <P>People on approved schemes, such as community employment &ndash; CE &ndash; can retain part of their rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to a gross household income limit of £250 per week and certain other conditions. Following discussions with the social partners, under Partnership 2000 substantial improvements in the conditions relating to the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements were introduced from 6 April 2000.</P>
      <P>The £250 per month limit on the amount of rent supplement payable was abolished and the sharp withdrawal of support at the end of the third year was removed, the supplement now being withdrawn on a tapered basis over a four year period, that is, 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in year three and 25% in year four. As a result, many participants in CE schemes now retain a greater amount of rent supplement than they would have done under the earlier arrangements. This is particularly the case for families.</P>
      <P>In no circumstances should the new rules result in a lower rate of rent supplement than is payable under the standard rules of SWA. All recipients are entitled to either the gradually reducing amount that can be retained under the transitional arrangements described above or the amount that is normally paid under the standard rules of SWA described earlier, whichever is the greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> If the Deputy has a particular case in mind my Department will have the case examined on receipt of the relevant details to ensure that he is receiving his full entitlement.</P>
    <P>Finally, the conditions for receiving and retaining rent and mortgage interest supplement will be examined as part of the review of the SWA scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is generally available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over, and to carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>In 1998, I extended the free travel scheme to carers in receipt of carer's allowance, to recognise that carers may incur additional financial costs in caring full-time and to augment the low incomes of those who are in receipt of a means-tested payment. Further extensions could be considered only in a budgetary context and taking account of the financial and other needs of those not covered by the existing arrangements</P>
      <P>With regard to the time restrictions on the free travel scheme, these have been a feature of the scheme since its inception. They apply at peak times on city bus services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. They do not, however, apply in the case of mentally handicapped people, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass, which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central issue in regard to time restrictions relates to capacity constraints. Where restrictions apply, it is at the request of the transport companies because the transport system is under severe pressure from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART, suburban rail services, and on services <Col N="1630" /> provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>A review of the free schemes was published by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin, in April last year. The review notes that the demands for the easing of time restrictions are, without exception, based on the fact that people have difficulty attending hospitals for appointments that fall within the restricted peak times. The review recommends that the Department of Health and Children and the health boards should examine this problem with a view to introducing more convenient and flexible appointments for free travel pass holders. My Department has written to the Department of Health and Children, bringing this recommendation to their attention.</P>

The duties were assigned by the chief superintendent, Dublin metropolitan area, north central and their role was to protect life and property; to maintain law and order; to endeavour to ensure that no acts of violence occurred between those attending the event; to ensure the event took place without disruption; to ensure that no objects which could be used as missiles were conveyed into the event location; to prevent any acts of criminal damage to equipment and facilities located at the Plaza for the purpose of holding the event; to prevent unauthorised access to the event location; to assist stewards in ensuring the safety of those attending the event and to identify and seize any forged tickets which were presented by any person(s) attempting to gain entry to the event.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that in addition to general policing of the event, the concert was monitored by the divisional traffic unit, the divisional task force, the divisional drugs unit, the Garda air support unit and the Garda dog unit.</P>

      <P>The review group on the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme, which is under the chairmanship of my Department, is currently drafting a report for consideration by the Minister for Finance. It is hoped that this report will be ready for presentation to the Minister by mid/late June 2001. At this stage, it is not possible to make a statement about a specific publication date.</P>
      <P>In the course of its work, the review group invited written submissions from members of the public and organisations representing people with disabilities. Over 260 submissions were received. The group held two rounds of listening meetings during the course of the year 2000, where individuals and organisations were able to make oral presentations to the group. The group's work also included an examination of the situation in other jurisdictions. The group is carrying out a survey by questionnaire sent to the national organisations who made submissions. The purpose of the survey is to obtain further details on the specific types of adaptation to motor vehicles required by persons with various disabilities.</P>
      <P>A paper was presented to the tax strategy group last Autumn, outlining the work of the interdepartmental review group on the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme and issues arising. Following the enactment of the Finance Act, this paper is now available on the Department of Finance website at www.finance.irlgov.ie.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the <Col N="1637" /> vocational education committees as part of a block grant, which also covers the VEC head-office overheads and other activities, apart from the second level programme. The Department does not earmark allocations for individual schools or for the various activities of vocational education committees. The way in which the grant is distributed among schools is a matter for each committee, in line with their priorities and perceptions of need.</P>
    <P>The report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post primary schools and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach. The recommendations made in the steering group's report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools, are under continuing review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels.</P>
    <P>Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, and I am committed to bring greater equity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools.</P>

The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 151 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 143 pupils on 30 September 2000.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 212 and 213 together.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department that all teachers working with children with special needs will have relevant training. There has been a major increase in the last two years in the level of additional teaching resources made available by my Department to schools in order to assist them in catering for children with special educational needs. This positive intervention has provided significant additional educational support from highly qualified teachers in schools across the country. The existing full-time pre-service teacher training in the colleges of education contains appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These additional appointments do however, bring with them the need for additional training in the special needs area and this is being addressed on an ongoing basis. A range of programmes are in place and additional programmes <Col N="1642" /> are being planned. Since 1994, a national programme of training for learning support teachers has been in place. At present, postgraduate courses for teachers at primary and post-primary levels are held in six centres in universities and in colleges of education.</P>
    <P>Guidelines for learning support teachers have issued to schools and a major training programme based on the guidelines is at an advanced stage of development. It is proposed to include training for resource teachers in this programme. Resource courses are also provided for primary teachers at St Patrick's College, Drumcondra, Mary Immaculate College, Limerick, St. Angela's College, Sligo and, for post primary teachers in the Church of Ireland, the College of Education, Rathmines.</P>
    <P>I also established a task force in October of last year to examine educational provision for children with dyslexia. I expect to have the report and recommendations of the task force shortly.</P>
    <P>My Department has embarked on intensive training programmes in the area of autism. Five-day training programmes for special school/class teachers, resource and classroom teachers are being provided at present. My Department also funds a professional training programme run by the University of Birmingham and St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra. One of the longer-term objectives of such training is to add to the level of expertise that already exists in Ireland in the special needs area, thereby enabling the design and delivery of training courses by Irish experts to meet the ongoing training requirements as they arise. The report of the task force on autism will shortly be available to me and this will provide a basis for the consideration of further training provision in this area.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, my Department provides funding for a wide range of shorter courses for learning support teachers and other interested teachers in the special needs area. These courses are mainly provided through the network of education centres, through teachers' organisations and through the programme of summer courses for primary teachers.</P>
    <P>In order to assess the ongoing training requirements in the special needs area, in view of the diverse nature of those needs and in the light of the increase in the number of teachers recently appointed, a review of training needs is under way at present.</P>
