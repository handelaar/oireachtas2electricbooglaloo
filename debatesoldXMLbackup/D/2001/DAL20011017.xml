      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 on four different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first topic, I have received notices from Deputies Jim Higgins and Trevor Sargent. I call first on Deputy Jim Higgins to state the matter.</P>

        <b>:</b> I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter that requires urgent consideration, namely, the decision by the European Union to dismiss the case put by the Minister for Public Enterprise for special State aid for Aer Lingus. The EU decision to permit only very limited aid will lead inevitably to the loss of 2,500 jobs and will do irreparable damage to the survival prospects of our national carrier.</P>

      <P>I request under Standing Order 31 that Dáil Éireann be suspended to allow adequate time for all parties and groups, not just Fine Gael and the Labour Party, to debate the urgent matter of a rescue plan and viable strategy for Aer Lingus and to determine how management can be wholly comprised of those with aviation and business expertise, free of political patronage. Management should be given the resources to restore Aer Lingus to a healthy state with a viable future.</P>

      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the implications of the current dispute with landowners for the implementation of the NDP road building programme, such as the effect on farms that have geared up based on Government assurances and have paid staff to remain idle for six months, the cost to the taxpayer for signed site investigation contracts which cannot be fulfilled and the urgent need for the Government to resolve the dispute.</P>

Such an Adjournment would enable Dáil Éireann to debate the urgent need to introduce community Garda policing schemes in our towns and cities and the need to reopen village and rural Garda stations. The failure of the Minister to take initiatives in these areas has led to vigilantism and will continue to breed vigilantes.</P>

As Leader of my party and a Member for the Dublin North constituency, I feel very strongly about this issue. I ask the Chair to ensure that all parties and groups in this House can make statements on the matter. It is a basic suggestion, one that should not disrupt the order of the House. I ask the Ceann Comhairle to facilitate that. I am not in a position to accept the Order of Business until that is made clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Tánaiste as the leading woman Minister is aware of the crisis in the health services in Dublin, particularly in the maternity hospitals. The crisis is such that Dublin mothers can no longer reasonably expect to have their babies in Dublin maternity hospitals due to <Col N="565" /> the shortage of midwives. Does the Tánaiste find this situation acceptable in the Government's fifth year in office? What are her views on the medical, legal and clinical implications of the fact that 110 midwife posts remain vacant in Dublin? Has the Government considered introducing a Dublin weighting to alleviate this problem and fill the vacancies?</P>

      <P>In addition to the question put by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, will the Tánaiste, on behalf of the Government, indicate when the much heralded strategy on health will be published? The Taoiseach indicated around Easter that it would be published early in the summer. The Minister for Health and Children has announced it on a number of occasions. Has a draft been presented to the Cabinet and does it contain estimates regarding the additional funds necessary to resolve the crisis to which the Leader of the Fine Gael Party referred? When will the health strategy be published with those details?</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the Government's complacency in its fifth year in office when the health services are in such chaos. Young Dublin women, who have been driven out of the city to far-flung midland towns by the Government's failed housing policy, will not now be allowed to have their babies in Dublin hospitals. The Government is threatening young mothers who are resident in Dublin that they may have to move to hospitals in the midlands that are already full to have their babies.</P>

When the Medical Council adopted its guidelines recently, the Government felt it was then practical and workable to proceed to enacting in legislation the practice that exists <Col N="569" /> in Ireland. There is no ideal solution to this issue, as the Labour Party is aware. The proposals put forward protect women whose lives are at risk during pregnancy. For the first time, it puts on a statutory basis the procedures that are currently carried out on a non-statutory basis.

      <P>The Ordnance Survey office has been based in the Phoenix Park, Dublin, for 175</P>
      <P>years or so. I did not have any difficulty gaining access to the Ordnance Survey Office. However, it is practically impossible to get to or from other offices in Dublin, such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in Kildare Street. People who want to do business there have experienced great difficulty with traffic congestion. I always found that access to the Ordnance Survey Office in the Phoenix Park was easy and I did not receive any complaints about it from constituents. People from all parts of the country can access it because of its proximity to the M50 motorway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staff in the Ordnance Survey Office are not only professional but helpful. The increase in work as a result of land division and the creation of land parcels has caused its own problems. There is a lack of sufficient staff to deal with the ongoing mapping problems. It is not unusual for six, nine or 12 months to elapse between an application being made and an applicant receiving the final map. Queries might be raised after a number of months and representations would be made by constituents about the delays. I am not blaming <Col N="574" /> the staff but the fact that the office is understaffed. This extra work has been created as a result of the sub-division of land and the sale of sites for developments. It is important that this work is done properly because, if it is not, it can create enormous difficulties and lead to litigation. The professionalism of the staff is not in question.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled about the Minister's decision to privatise an important State function without consulting the staff, recognising the commitment they have given and the role they have played, protecting their rights as civil servants and outlining their role in the new system he proposes to set up, which has not been clearly spelt out. I have received a number of telephone calls since I spoke on this issue last week from people who are puzzled, worried and annoyed about the situation. This process is ongoing and slow-moving, like many other things in this country, and the fact that people are annoyed does not help them to deliver the type of service we expect. We do not want people to spend their time looking over their shoulder and wondering about their position. If we want to get the best results from staff, we must ensure they are reasonably comfortable in their jobs and that they can get on with their day's work.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister spelt out where decentralisation will occur or are the locations up for grabs? Will Ministers be able to say they want an office moved to their constituencies? I am glad the Minister of State is shaking his head, which means it will not happen. The Minister owes it to the people in the Ordnance Survey Office to clarify this situation and to allow them to get on with their work. Extra staff are necessary as the Ordnance Survey Office is greatly understaffed. It may be difficult to get people because this is an expert field. Training will be required to help people in the areas of land mapping and site visits.</P>
    <P>I want to place on the record my satisfaction with the work the Ordnance Survey Office has done. The staff have always been helpful when I, as a public representative, made representations to them. Any time I called to the office the staff were courteous and professional. We cannot throw that away in the interests of privatising something which is not a commercial service. It is a State service which is time-consuming but which must be done well by staff who understand the work they are doing.</P>

      <P>I thank you. This Government has spent the past four and a half years on red alert as a result of spin doctoring. No other Government has relied so much on shadow and less on substance since the foundation of the State. It has avoided every possible issue because if it agreed on any issue, it turned out to be a shambles, as we saw on a few occasions when it did not have another option. We have seen the Tánaiste sulking for days on end. That is the record of this Government.</P>
      <P>When I read this Bill, I think of decentralisation. However, the Government does not have any intention of decentralising anything. Approximately 150 towns, as the Minister of State said, were put on red alert and each town was competing against each other. Is that good government? I would like the Minister of State to tell me what decentralisation means in this context because he mentioned it in his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Ordnance Survey Office, no section of a Department can operate without staff. The Minister of State knows that the staff of the Ordnance Survey Office is aggrieved, upset and annoyed. I want the Minister of State to allay the fears and concerns of the loyal staff who have operated in the office for many years and who have a long tradition of service, although not in the best circumstances as the Minister of State admitted. That is one of the reasons he wants to change the headquarters of the Ordnance Survey Office. Some of the loyal staff have retired. The staff feel the Minister of State is introducing this Bill without any concern for them. They have not received any answers to their questions and the union, on their behalf, has not got any satisfaction from the Department. The Minister of State should allay their fears about losing their Civil Service status. I want the Minister of State to address that. I also want him to discuss their concerns about the loss of the option to transfer to another branch of the Civil Service. I want the Minister to answer that question. I also want him to allay the fears concerning the Government's policy on decentralisation. It seems there was no such policy. Decentralisation was just a word given to the spin doctors who were told to run with it for a couple of weeks to keep everybody happy. At one stage, the Tánaiste said 10,000 jobs <Col N="576" /> would be transferred out of Dublin. That is a fact, although it is hard to believe that two and a half years ago a Minister announced that 10,000 jobs would be transferred outside Dublin. There has not been a word about it since. If one mentions that to any member of the Government now, including the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, they look amazed. The Minister of State is asking himself whether he is dreaming. Did he think this up? That is the policy of the Government, yet nothing has been done about it. They have been spin-doctoring again. Shadow, not substance, is the policy of this Government.</P>
    <P>In my town there is a branch of the Ordnance Survey whose staff, in common with their colleagues elsewhere, want to know if they will be allowed to transfer or avail of early retirement in the event of those branch offices closing down. That is another question the Minister will have to answer.</P>
    <P>I have posed three pertinent questions for the Minister who is responsible for the Ordnance Survey. He introduced this Bill, yet he took his eye off the ball, which in this case is the staff. The Minister and the Government must allay the fears of the loyal, capable and experienced staff who have kept the Ordnance Survey going over the years. He must answer those questions clearly for the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the initiatives in the Ordnance Survey Ireland Bill, including the transformation of the Ordnance Survey into a State body. Since the establishment of the Ordnance Survey some 177 years ago, a vast amount of work has been done by that body in preparing maps and other documents for legislative, legal and other purposes, including the transfer of land and other property. The Ordnance Survey has accomplished a monumental task very well in collating all the relevant documentation and other data. In the past ten to 15 years, the operation of the Ordnance Survey has undergone massive change given the advent of the technological age. It has moved in a relatively short space from hand-drawn mapping to computerised digital processes. Mapping instrumentation employed by Ordnance Survey staff from the early 19th century continued in use through most of the 20th century but nowadays that has all changed with the advent of new information technology.</P>
      <P>As recently as ten years ago, it was difficult to obtain detailed maps for property transfers, both in rural and urban areas. Today, however, following the establishment of Ordnance Survey agencies throughout the country one can obtain maps within minutes, provided one has the relevant documentation, including folio numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main objects of the Bill is the establishment of a new body to deal with Ordnance <Col N="577" /> Survey matters. The four main operational categories of the present Ordnance Survey are: the updating and maintenance of the framework on which national mapping is based and on which many industries, such as construction, survey, transport and air navigation, depend; a programme to complete a new mapping infrastructure for rural Ireland in the short-term; an ongoing maintenance and development programme to ensure that urban, rural, and tourism and leisure mapping databases are up to date; developing a marketing and sales function to ensure that products and services are suitably developed to meet the ongoing and anticipated needs of public and private customers.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the general function of Ordnance Survey Ireland will be to continue to provide the national mapping service in the State, and that it will operate in the public interest by creating and maintaining definitive maps and geological information of the State. For the first time, the Bill contains a detailed listing of the tasks that are necessary for the Ordnance Survey to provide its public interest role. It is important to place such tasks on a statutory basis because various arms of the State are legally dependent on the Ordnance Survey's services. For example, over the years one has heard of various court cases concerning rights of way and, while the position of Ordnance Survey Ireland was taken as being definitive, it is no harm to place it on a statutory basis now.</P>
    <P>Generations of workers in the Ordnance Survey have accomplished a huge amount of work since its inception in 1824. When we purchase maps today, whether they are obtained for planning permission purposes or conveyancing, we can see all the detail that appears, including monuments. The Heritage Service, Dúchas, has been involved in upgrading information on our national monuments. The Ordnance Survey material dates back to original maps created in the 19th century and even earlier, including elements dating from our medieval history. A huge amount of work has been accomplished by Ordnance Survey staff over the years, who have always been dedicated to ensuring the provision of proper services, including up to date mapping. In the 1820s, it must have been an enormous task to set about creating this amount of detailed information. We owe a debt of gratitude to those who created the first Ordnance Survey maps because when people wish to study the history of their localities they can now refer to those early maps. In debating this Bill, it is only right to pay tribute to those who put so much effort and dedication into their task.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out to put the Ordnance Survey on a long-term, commercially viable footing. In the short-term, however, some State money will have to be pumped into it to ensure that it will remain viable. I note from the Bill that Ordnance Survey Ireland may be required to pay a dividend to the Exchequer, if that becomes necessary. It is certainly no harm that OSI should become a <Col N="578" /> viable State body, competing to provide a wide variety of services. That is the central message of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I also hope to see a continuation of the service which OSI has provided for the past 177 years, particularly the vast improvements which have taken place in the past ten years or so due to technological developments and which have made information available almost at the touch of a button. I have no reason to believe this service will not continue, and I hope it does. I pay tribute to all who worked in the Ordnance Survey over the past 177 years for their dedication.</P>
    <P>The information available on computer in most Ordnance Survey offices comprises current maps. It would be helpful if the original maps dating from the early 19th century were also available in computerised format. Such computerised maps would be vital for archaeologists, public representatives and others dealing in planning and other issues. I know this is the case with respect to some maps, but it should be the case as regards all Ordnance Survey maps.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, for bringing it before the House. This is worthwhile legislation which is long overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Ordnance Survey Ireland has made a significant impact since its inception 177 years ago. The previous speaker raised the important issue of the preservation of heritage which has been overlooked for many years. Ordnance Survey Ireland's mapping systems have enabled us to preserve many monuments which may have been lost to time, decay and progress. The fact that such monuments were positioned on maps allowed us to identify and preserve them. This is an important point and I pay tribute to the staff of OSI who were involved in the mapping and detailing of Ireland over all those years.</P>
      <P>Times change and things move on and so must Ordnance Survey Ireland. The advent of technology and pressures and competition from organisations outside the State which could also carry out its functions make it imperative that OSI is put on a more commercial footing and is allowed to use the mapping expertise it has built up over many years to operate in the commercial world and to sell its products, services and expertise. This Bill will remove OSI from the aegis of the Civil Service and give it the freedom to sell its wares. I thank the staff for their efforts in the past and wish them luck in the future. I hope this enabling legislation will allow OSI to flourish, marketing itself as an experienced mapping organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill, OSI will continue to fulfil its traditional role of providing mapping services for the administrative, legislative, infrastructural and other needs of the State as it has done so effectively for the past 177 years. At present this role falls into four main operational categories. First, <Col N="579" /> the updating and maintenance of the framework on which national mapping is based and on which many industries such as construction, surveying, transport and air navigation depend. OSI is an integral part of planning in the context of the national development plan and the ongoing development of our infrastructure. This highlights the impact which OSI has on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>The second operational category involves a programme to complete a new mapping infrastructure for rural Ireland in the short-term, an ongoing maintenance and development programme to ensure that urban, rural, tourism and leisure mapping databases are kept up to date and developing a marketing and sales function to ensure that products and services are suitably developed to meet the ongoing and anticipated needs of public and private customers.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the general functions of OSI will continue to be to provide the national mapping service in the State and that it will operate in the public interest by creating and maintaining the definitive maps and geographical information of the State. The Bill sets out for the first time a detailed list of the tasks necessary for OSI to fulfil its public interest role. Accordingly, OSI will be required to continue to map all areas, including those which do not provide a commercial return on its activities. This is an important issue as some areas will not provide commercial returns. It is important that such activities continue and I welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>There was also a concern that OSI's loss-making activities would be a burden on the Exchequer. However, the Bill provides that OSI, when engaging in commercial activities, may do so through subsidiary companies with limited liability set up under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999. Any capital necessary for such companies will not come from the public purse, but will be raised in the marketplace on the basis of the commercial merits of the projects concerned. In short, there will be no cross-subsidisation of commercial activities by the Exchequer in respect of capital or running costs.</P>
    <P>Measures to ensure there is no cross-subsidisation by the Exchequer of potential commercial activities by OSI are an important feature of the Bill. These include clear statements of OSI's public interest functions, the requirement of the service agreement with the Minister for Finance to deliver the specified public interest outputs in return for Exchequer money and provisions to establish separate limited companies which will operate on a purely commercial basis for any commercial activities.</P>
    <P>In addition, OSI will operate transparent accounting practices to identify commercial activities which it will separate from non-commercial activities. It will also implement a fair and transparent pricing policy which will ensure that OSI's basic data is available to competitors in the <Col N="580" /> marketplace on the same terms and conditions as those which apply to its subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the great strides which OSI has made to prepare itself for the future. Advances in technology have been made possible by the substantial sums allocated to OSI in recent years to ensure that it uses the most up-to-date techniques in mapping. For example, OSI is leading the way in the use of satellite positioning and is in the process of implementing a network of permanently operating global positioning system receivers. This system is expected to be operational by early next year and will be controlled from OSI's computer headquarters.</P>
    <P>Similarly, OSI uses advanced in-house geographical information systems used to store all collectable digital mapping data and to supply, edit and manage such data. It is anticipated that supplying GIS users with digital mapping products will be a major area of business growth. It is important that we give OSI the flexibility which was not possible heretofore under its former structure. This is a positive development. OSI has a wealth of experience and it must be allowed to flourish in the commercial world by selling that experience.</P>
    <P>There are always concerns when change takes place. Some are uncertain of the effect this legislation will have on OSI. However, I am confident the staff will adjust. All those involved in drafting the legislation engaged in consultations and I am confident the staff will be able to move forward with confidence and pride, knowing their future is secure because of the expertise which has been built up over many years.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State who has put much work into this legislation and into negotiations with all involved. Ordnance Survey Ireland has given a great service to the State. I am confident that in the years ahead it will continue to give a great service and ensure its major role of mapping is not lost when it moves into the commercial world. I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House and wish the staff and everybody involved the best of luck in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for his indulgence and the dissemination of information which I have not yet had time to appreciate fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first time I climbed Nephin mountain in County Mayo, I saw the pillar at the top &ndash; the trigonometrical point. When one looks north from there one can see Barnesmore Gap south of Derry, the Erris peninsula, the Atlantic to the west and a full sweep brings one south over Galway into Clare and east across the plains of Mayo into Roscommon and Galway. The Ordnance Survey question that used to be asked in the intermediate certificate was of great interest to hundreds of thousands of people. Sometimes a map of a mountain in one's own county or region would be included and one might know it very well. The people from 1820 who carried out the <Col N="581" /> surveys of Ireland are owed an enormous debt of gratitude for determining every boreen, pathway, ditch and drain. They noted every grove of trees, wood, forest and swamp, and every crannóg, human dwelling, village and town was recorded. That has evolved since the 1820s.</P>
    <P>Some of the hand-drawn maps of landlords' estates from the 1830s to the 1850s are incredibly detailed. The persons who carried out those mapping contracts had a powerful commitment to the work in hand and their work has lasted. When watching the Discovery Channel one can see what can be done from Cheyenne Mountain in the United States. There is a bunker built there, half a mile under a mountain of granite, which has been designed to withstand a nuclear attack and a large number of communications satellites are controlled from there. Radar imaging satellites can instantly give an exact and detailed picture of every aspect of any area on the globe, irrespective of weather conditions. The work that was begun by hand by the first person to put a trigonometrical point on Nephin mountain, to what is happening today, is part of a powerful social history of this country.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Bill is necessary; it is long overdue. It is fair to say that permanency of employment does not apply to any job anymore. Given circumstances that are outside one's control, what might appear to be a permanent position &ndash; or one of some quality &ndash;  may not be that. In so far as the Minister can, I hope he clarifies matters for the staff who will be discommoded by this move. They may feel threatened and that this new dawn will mean a great degree of uncertainty. I am sure the Minister will be able to deal with that. This is not the first time a section of the Civil Service has been transformed into a commercial entity. In the preparation of the national spatial plan, the national development plan and the decentralisation programme, the Minister will obviously have an influence on where sections of this office might be located or relocated. I recall raising in the House the controversy in the ordnance survey headquarters in Phoenix Park about poor accommodation and the poor structural quality of some of the building there. References were made to ceilings collapsing and the poor state of the equipment. I assume that was dealt with and, if not, I assume it will be dealt with under this Bill. I note that a number of map shops, probably on franchise from the OSI, have been established around the country. This could be a very commercial enterprise and could be a wonderful success.</P>
    <P>One will note from the title deeds of many terraced houses in towns and villages that the gardens and fences have been put in the wrong place. Some people have not changed the title deeds to their property for many years. The function of the OSI in being able to produce accurate maps is critical. The announcement of the gargantuan road project from Kilcullen to Waterford is a case in point. It is 110 kilometres long, 100 metres wide and will cost £550 million. It will cut a mass<Col N="582" /> ive swathe through habitats, habitations and virgin ground. OSI maps from the 1820s have covered that tract of land and recorded its history. A new future is coming and whether it is right or wrong, or is objected to or not, that land will never be the same again. That 100 metre wide band will be there for the next 150 years. Once the NRA and its contractors do their work, there will be a new categorisation of how the country surrounding the road will develop.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will, in so far as he can, offer clarification to the staff and tell them that this is very necessary. The commercial wing can be exploited for everyone's benefit, particularly for those who work there. The OSI will be able to reflect the needs of a modern country. When decisions are made to invest in infrastructure, industry or communications which will change the topography of the land, a quick, accurate and detailed response is required. It is important that Ordnance Survey Ireland is able to respond to that in a professional, efficient and commercial manner. I like the Irish version of the office's title &ndash; Suirbhéireacht Ordanáis Éireann. It is a fine sounding name.</P>
    <P>The list of functions to be performed by the body is wide ranging and gives an idea of the possible scope of activity. The decision to transform the Civil Service wing into a commercial wing will obviously mean Ordnance Survey Ireland will be run in a professional manner. I am not aware if the Minister has determined who the four to nine members of the board will be, but I hope the appointees will reflect the kind of people who should be on the board, namely, individuals with an interest in this area rather than people who have, for example, spoken kindly to a member of the Government.</P>
    <P>In addition to having an interest in the field, board members must be professional and efficient because if the Government decides to transform the OSI into a commercial, semi-State organisation, the board will have to take responsibility for ensuring that decision is implemented effectively, professionally and efficiently. I hope the Minister complies with Government requirements on gender balance and finds people with commitment. The board's predecessors were responsible for the physical mapping of the topography of the land and drawing the original Ordnance Survey maps. The next board will be the planners and map makers of the future. If it and its chief executive do not possess a driving commitment to fulfil the mandate outlined by the Government, the fears and concerns of staff will boil over.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend, the Minister gives his appointees a clear mandate. Board positions must not be a sop, but ones in which appointees will be expected to perform. OSI must set an example by becoming a model semi-State organisation which others will be proud to follow commercially and professionally. It must be able to meet the needs, demands and requirements placed on <Col N="583" /> it by Government and to respond to the ordinary public.</P>
    <P>I do not know what sort of examination system will be in place in 20 years time. It is possible that there will never again be a question about Ordnance Survey maps. Regardless of the future direction of technology, we will still have to see the land around us, the mountains and hills, the lakes and rivers. Somebody had to map them first and did so very successfully. I hope OSI will be able to duplicate that success in future using modern, professional, 21st century methodology. Its staff should be able to say its initial fears and concerns were addressed by a responsive Government. It must be justly proud of having made the break with the past, embarked on a new course and set a standard for others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Having operated for 170 years without any fundamental legislation governing its activities, this Bill is necessary for OSI. It is about time primary legislation was introduced to regulate Ordnance Survey Ireland. On another level, however, it amazes me that OSI has always been part of the Department of Finance. It is extraordinary that a Minister can admit it is necessary to change the status of a body such as Ordnance Survey Ireland in order to free it from the shackles of his Department and thus allow it the commercial freedom to compete in today's world. The Department of Finance, which sets itself up as a kind of god able to run everything while others have no idea how to run anything, now admits its bureaucracy is smothering the Ordnance Survey and fundamental changes are necessary to allow the organisation to breathe. If that is the position, changes are required to the Department of Finance rather than the Ordnance Survey.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for the Department to refer to restrictions imposed on OSI by Civil Service staff, but the admission that the way it does business can smother an organisation is dreadful. I am amazed at some of the recent Department statements signalling the reason for change. They amount to a terrible admission of its own faults.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not go the full way. It gives the Ordnance Survey a status similar to that of the Civil Service. The logic of the argument is that this is a half way house and OSI should be privatised as soon as possible. This trend has been discernible for a decade in all Governments. I often wonder if it is necessary to continue moving bodies into the competition of the private sector. When will we reconsider this policy? People will argue that the world has changed, there are EU rules and, therefore, nothing stands still, but at the same time we, too, are changing. One month we plan to sell off Aer Lingus, the next we discover the company is of vital national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are following a trend set in other countries. It appears the UK is reconsidering privatisation by proposing to re-nationalise the railway infrastructure. Has the Minister examined the way in <Col N="584" /> which the British ordnance survey has been handled. Its status was altered several years ago, yet I understand its former status was partially reinstated due to the problems it encountered. I am reassured the British have seen the errors of their ways and learned from their mistakes. However, it would be very wrong for us to ruthlessly and recklessly press ahead with an agenda set in 1987 or thereabouts. I hope, therefore, that someone in the Department has been following events in Britain.</P>
    <P>Several speakers mentioned the concerns of staff, some of which appear to be legitimate. I hope efforts are being made to allay those concerns. Sometimes management claims to have spent a certain number of hours in consultation with staff. It looks very impressive and allays the concerns of outsiders. However, OSI staff state that management sat down and talked, but provided no information. Consultation and discussion have to be meaningful. That does not only mean management being able to give the Minister the line that it has spent a specific number of days or hours in consultations or working parties, which from day one appear to have been nothing more than a stalling PR exercise designed to allow it to report having gone through the motions. That is not sufficient. An hour or two of straight talking to tell people what is happening, why it is happening and what the long-term agenda is, is far more meaningful than days and weeks of meetings that no one wants. The view is that staff are only being brought halfway into the loop, but their fears and suspicions seem to grow rather than being allayed by these meetings.</P>
    <P>I worked for a semi-State body which had worker directors and was a trade union activist for years. Workers want worker directors. The trend now is to bring in the social partners and place an IBEC representative, trade union fat cat representative or retired Labour Party member on the board. That is not what workers want. I accept the trend under the national agreements is to have the social partners represented, but it is not a case of having a farmer, trade union official or somebody from IBEC. I do not know who they represent. Workers want a worker director, they do not want anyone else who was or might have been a sympathiser or an ex-trade union official. That desire is deeply ingrained in many organisations and workers are not happy with the recent trend. The inclusion of the social partners may quieten major lobby groups, but it is not what workers want. Workers want a worker director, here and elsewhere. They want a worker director elected by them, not somebody supposedly representing them. I do not understand the indecision. The Minister should agree to the appointment of worker directors.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Phoenix Park is not an ideal site and that under the decentralisation programme the Ordnance Survey may be moved from there. I know the Government has decentralisation plans which are not being announced for the moment. There is talk about moving some<Col N="585" /> thing from Dublin to Killybegs, Clifden, Caherciveen or Waterford, to the extremities of the country. However, the result is the removal of offices from the suburbs of Dublin, such as the Phoenix Park. People should be moved out of their offices in Merrion Street and downtown Dublin to the Phoenix Park, the M50, the Dublin suburbs. There is no need to go to the extremities of the world.</P>

Many people drive into Dublin to work every day from Carlow and Mullingar. There is no need to go to the farthest part of west Galway.</P>

      <P>The plans have been worked out, but the Government does not wish to be accused of strokes and that is fair enough. I am amazed and amused that only the little bits are being announced with people being moved from the Phoenix Park, not Merrion Street. Places a couple of miles from the city centre should be getting their fair share. While I have nothing against Galway or anywhere else getting its slice of the action, decentralisation does not have to extend to the western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Workers in the Ordnance Survey have other complaints. The interim board and management seemed to have moved the situation on. I understand in recent times they have decided that the print section is to be closed down. Why is that happening? The workers told me that they were not properly consulted. Before the legislation is passed management and the interim board are so impatient that they are moving the goalposts before the flag is raised and have decided to close down the print section. Consultation and a working party went nowhere. Management did not seem to know what it wanted. There is no justification for machinery being used for only 20 hours per week, if that is the case. That is a disgrace. Inefficiency is not permissible, be it in a Department, semi-State body or private organisation. It should not happen. If this was happening under the management of the Department of Finance, people in that Department should answer for its inefficiency. The people to be reprimanded should be those in the Department of Finance, not those in other bodies such as the Ordnance <Col N="586" /> Survey. Inefficiency is not allowed and should not be tolerated. All these moves towards privatisation and getting away from the Civil Service would not be necessary if there was proper management and consultation.</P>
    <P>Workers are reasonable people if spoken to in a straightforward manner. The UK Ordnance Survey office took a similar decision and outsourced the printing of maps. The result was lorry-loads of maps being returned because of inaccuracies. The Ordnance Survey may work slowly, but mistakes in maps are noticed at an early stage. Perhaps the work is checked too thoroughly. This may contribute to the efficiency problem. The British now realise the outsourcing of printing was a mistake. We have the benefit of knowing what happened in the UK Ordnance Survey. If they realise that the outsourcing of printing was a mistake, we should be taking notice.</P>
    <P>The workers are upset that before the legislation is passed management is changing the ground rules and closing the printing section. It looks as if somebody wants to close the whole place down as a way of ensuring efficiency. It is not necessary to remove bodies from under the aegis of a Department or privatise them in order to achieve efficiency.</P>
    <P>It is the job of management to decide what is necessary. Consultation with the workers is necessary &ndash; they need to be brought along with the process. There are many complaints from staff about how things are being done. They feel they are not being told the whole story. If the OSI is to have a bright future, a relationship of trust must be established between management and the workers. There have been talks in recent days. However, the important thing is not the number of hours involved in talks but that there is straight talking and that progress is made. Workers need to be brought along in this process. If they are constantly afraid of further announcements and if they feel the management is not being up-front with them, there will be no real progress and both sides will remain locked into an old-fashioned &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude. Enlightened and up-front management is required. Workers are not fools and they will respond if they are treated as adults.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as a response to the need for change, but I also share Deputy Noel Ahern's concern. The Minister of State, in his statement on Second Stage a few days ago, quoted the interim chairperson of the board as saying it was not possible for the Civil Service to deliver this new service on a commercially viable basis. Whether intentionally or otherwise, that statement conveys a doubt, which Deputy Ahern has also expressed, as to the capacity of the Civil Service to deliver a modern service to the people who require it. We must acknowledge the courtesy, efficiency and helpfulness of the Ordnance Survey Office staff over many years. Why, after 177 years, can they no longer do that job effec<Col N="587" /> tively? It is bewildering. I accept the statement by the Minister of State that the staff seemed very happy about the proposals and I hope that is the case. However, I wonder how they react to the comment of the interim chairperson, Mr. Bonner, to which I have just referred. I hope the Minister of State will comment on that in his reply.</P>
      <P>Ordnance survey maps have often caused contention at a very local level, in the context of subdivision of land and property rights, with people pursuing their entitlements down to the last inch. We depend on the Ordnance Survey Office for accuracy and, in general, that has been provided in great detail. Nevertheless, there have been some inaccuracies. I recall an incident a few years ago, involving a mountaineering group in the McGillicuddy Reeks in County Kerry. Through fate, their progress was halted by the unexpected onset of darkness but, if they had continued, they would have come to a cliff edge much sooner than was indicated on their ordnance survey map. When light returned, they found that they would, literally, have gone over the edge if they had relied on the detail of the map. Perhaps, at the time of the original mapping, such precise detail was not considered vitally important, but it was obviously of critical importance in that instance.</P>
      <P>Most children have access to ordnance survey maps through the educational system at an early stage and they may also become familiar with map reading through orienteering or scouting activities. Having regard to the wide range of purposes for which maps are used, it is essential that they are competently and professionally prepared. I welcome the provision in this Bill with regard to greater resources and personnel in that regard. In addition to the more familiar uses of maps, such as road navigation and defining property boundaries, modern digitised mapping technology and geographic information systems involve a vastly greater amount of detail.</P>
      <P>Why is it necessary to have such a vague provision with regard to the number of members to be appointed to the board, within the range of four to nine? Why can we not specify a precise number of members? If it is restricted to the minimum of four, the representation of interest groups which the Minister of State has mentioned, such as chartered surveyors, trade unions and many others, will not be very widely representative. The number of members on the board should be clearly defined from the very outset. The educational sector, which is not provided for, should also be represented, having regard to the importance of maps throughout the educational process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the board will be established for a five year term, the first members of the board will be appointed for four years only. What is the reason for that? Does the Minister of State expect that the teething problems of the initial board may not be apparent at this stage and is he reserving the opportunity, if necessary, to have the first board replaced ahead of schedule? The chairper<Col N="588" /> son and chief executive officer will be appointed for a five year period. Perhaps, in his reply, the Minister of State will comment on the differentiation.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Connaughton, referred to the importance of mapping in relation to the Land Registry. I am not sure whether the problem in that office originates in the Department of Finance or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, though the overlap is obvious.</P>
    <P>The strain and stress on personnel in the Land Registry office is very difficult to understand. Given the requirements and the volume of requests that lie in that office and the inadequacy of staffing and of resources in general to respond to the urgent needs of people seeking maps, it is something that requires an immediate response. There is an opportunity here for the OSI to maybe link into the requirements of the Land Registry. There are backlogs in the Land Registry and it is important to provide whatever is necessary by way of resources and additional personnel to deliver the service within a reasonable time. I hope the Government will overcome that problem.</P>
    <P>The staff in the Land Registry, like those in the Ordnance Survey, are of the highest calibre and their courtesy and helpfulness is beyond mention. However, the pressure under which they work to provide a reasonable standard of service is unbelievable. I hope that is dealt with as a matter of urgency in the interests of all Departments connected and associated with it whether the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the traditional service the personnel from the Ordnance Survey have given down through the years. It has a very illustrious history in providing a mapping service for the State. Many other speakers mentioned the transfer of a number of staff from the Civil Service to a new independent commercial company. If the degree of satisfaction, as expressed by the Minister of State, is there, it is very welcome. We hope for a smooth transition. The Minister of State, who has responsibility for this, has given guarantees that the workers will not lose out in any way. We hope there will be no hidden agendas and that nobody will lose out as a result of this transfer. It is of particular interest to many workers and personnel in the Civil Service at large. We have noticed over the years that there has been a necessity to change the functions of various agencies, traditionally under State management, in a modern society. For the reasons I mentioned, if an organisation is no longer to have Civil Service status and is to become an independent body, the personnel should be given an absolute guarantee that they will not lose out. At a time when many other workers across the economy are concerned about job security, we must give them a guarantee that they will not lose out. That would be welcome.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention maps and details. As a result of the national development plan, the <Col N="589" /> National Roads Authority is producing maps with enormous detail. That is a requirement in outlining the routes for the various roads. The difficulty I have is that initial maps used by the NRA giving the general outline or the corridor through which these roads would go were old and lacking in detail. Further examination by the project teams and the consultants involved in delivering the final preferred options showed clearly that the older maps lacked the necessary details. When many property owners looked at the original maps, they were satisfied the project would not have a great impact on them and on their holdings and properties. However, when the detailed maps were produced later, they showed clearly that the project impinged on their livelihoods to a far greater degree than was shown on the original maps. It is important that an agency like the NRA shows the detail at the initial planning stage rather than shock many landowners at a later stage. It has happened that many landowners were reasonably satisfied initially only to be shocked later by the detail. That is why this Bill is so important. The digitisation of maps is welcome in so far as people will be able to see every detail.</P>
    <P>There is a need for co-ordination. Maps in the hands of Dúchas and the detail on those maps are  not represented on OSI maps. I hope, with this new mapping agency, there will be greater co-ordination in the overall detail.</P>
    <P>With regard to copyright, in no area have copyright entitlements been broken as often as in the reproduction of maps without permission. I have not seen it referred to in the Bill and it may be covered by the copyright legislation. It is important that the new body which we will set up retains absolute copyright. At present the level of breach of copyright is unbelievable. Much litigation is due to map authenticity. Maps are being reproduced, although not by the proper agencies, and people are able to change the detail quite readily through modern technology. Can the Minister give an absolute guarantee that this new OSI will have copyright that cannot be infringed in any way, because this has again and again been the cause of time-consuming, costly and at times acrimonious litigation processes? Will the Minister also accept the need for widespread representation of interest groups on the board, the need for a response from the whole educational sector from training and education right through to the training of chartered accountants and so on, and the need for them to be represented from the start, even on a board with the minimum of four members?</P>
    <P>I wish the new OSI success. I hope neither the principles not the ethos established and operated by the old Ordnance Survey under the Civil Service system will be lost in this transition. Everybody knows of the courtesy and helpfulness of the people who have done the work for the past 177 years. I hope that will continue in the same vein for as long as is necessary under the new board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of this Bill. A stage has been reached where it has become necessary in order to enable the Ordnance Survey Office meet the demands of modern times. I have served in this House for quite some time and, like other public representatives, have had many dealings with that office. I praise what they do. They have been extraordinarily courteous and professional through the years, and I hope the new body will mirror that image. However &ndash; and I will come back to this &ndash; I have a strange feeling that the main impact of this change will be that Ordnance Survey maps will never again be as cheap as they are now because an air of commerciality is creeping into the system. I could write the script for what will happen.</P>
      <P>It is very important for a database for the progress of our nation that we have absolute accuracy in mapping, because there is not a single person in the State who does not have to deal at some stage during his or her life with a map of some sort, whether it is a map of the site of he or her house, farm or factory, a map of the roadways or airports, or of nature trails in the context of tourism. Anything one cares to mention requires a map. I do not want to go too deep into history, but we have had several huge mapping projects in this country, particularly during the last century. These were very accurate at that stage. However, the face of Ireland changed and many important landmarks no longer exist. In the world of farming there was a push in the 1980s to have every acre adjusted for tax purposes. The Ordnance Survey Office was involved in that because basic mapping was needed. That project had a short shelf life &ndash; it went on for two or three years but I have heard nothing about it in the past ten years. Because Government policy changed, the concept was deemed out of order. The satellite in the sky has been a remarkable step forward in the context of the farming community and area aid &ndash; every acre owned by nearly every one of the 170,000 farming families can now be called up on a screen in Hume House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the Ordnance Survey Office now wants to go in a different direction altogether. The Ordnance Survey Office is as important today as it was 177 years ago, and it will be just as important in another 100 years. It is the job of the Ordnance Survey Office to ensure that there is a map of every property. That brings me to a few very important issues. Many people might find it hard to believe, but despite the satellite in the sky and other mapping surveys, there are still quite large areas of this country that are not accurately mapped. There are no maps for some areas and, unfortunately, those areas coincide with areas that are not particularly valuable, for example, mountainous areas in respect of which, until a few years ago, nobody took much notice of whether they were mapped because they consisted of commonage used communally by local farmers. It is only in more recent times since we have had to comply with various European Union directives relating to special areas of conservation <Col N="591" /> and so on that they have taken on a whole new life of their own. I have met many groups in various capacities which were unable to find a map which was detailed enough for their purposes. There are also huge areas of bog for which there are no maps and which are shown only as big blank areas with no indication of ownership.</P>
    <P>The problem now is that when the Ordnance Survey Office is commercialised &ndash; I have no problem with that and can see why it must be done &ndash; the cost of the maps will increase unless some major profitable development takes place, and people with less valuable property will be unable to pay for maps even if they could get them. I understand that constructing a map is a costly business. I mentioned that during private Members' business when I spoke about the Land Registry Office and I will not go back over that now except to say that once a map is on file it can be worked on, but if a map has to be constructed for the purpose of area aid or for some other purpose, it requires much time and financial resources.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, the Ordnance Survey Office charged for maps on the basis that one map was no more costly than another but, as in all other areas of life, that may not be the case when it is commercialised. That is something about which the Minister will need to speak to the new board. I note that a State subsidy is provided for, but my fear is that some day somebody in Government will get a rush of blood to the head and tell the Ordnance Survey Office that it is on its own.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to report to the House on the outcome of the Transport Council meeting held in Luxembourg yesterday. The Council discussed the repercussions of the events of 11 September on aviation. Central <Col N="592" /> to the discussions was a report by the Commission which included proposals for a limited package of horizontal measures to compensate for the events of 11 September. Those proposals included compensation for the four days when US airspace was closed, coverage for insurance to the end of the year and discretion for states to cover additional security costs. The discussions ranged across the overall economic impact on airlines, aviation security, insurance, air traffic control and competition issues.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the meeting, I had face-to-face meetings or telephone conversations with a number of my EU ministerial colleagues, including those from Austria, France, Portugal, Italy and Greece. This is in addition to correspondence and a meeting with the Belgian President of the Transport Council. I also met Commissioner de Palacio on several occasions, most recently in a private meeting yesterday morning prior to the Council, during which I was explicit about the position of Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>In my statement to the Council I strongly expressed the view that it was not acceptable that any European airline should be allowed to collapse as a result of the terrorist attacks. That would be fulfilling the agenda of the terrorists. Second, I warned that these dreadful circumstances should not be used as a means to fast-track consolidation in Europe in a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; way, however justified that policy could be in normal times. This would be unwise and could lead to unpredictable results. I also highlighted that the transatlantic aviation market is proportionately more vital to the Irish economy than it is to the economy of any other EU member state.</P>
      <P>I stated that direct transatlantic links are crucial in attracting US tourists and facilitating business and cargo traffic and that despite being the second smallest member of the European Union, Ireland ranked seventh among the 15 states in terms of passengers carried on direct routes to the United States. In tourism terms, our dependence on the US market is, on average, three to four times greater than for other member states.</P>
      <P>I stressed the importance of Aer Lingus to the Irish economy. Aer Lingus accounts for 70% of direct Ireland-US traffic, carrying in excess of one million passengers in 2001. This represented a significant proportion of Aer Lingus's revenue and profits in 2000. I pointed out that these figures starkly show how the events of 11 September had such an impact on the company and the reason we believe strongly that a strategic national interest is threatened. I informed the Council that we do not advocate or seek a return to a regime of unco-ordinated or easy availability of state funding for European airlines and that we should not look at this as a normal state aid problem. I stressed that these are exceptional circumstances in aviation to which the European Commission should respond in an effective and measured way in co-operation with member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasised that we recognised the enormous strides achieved under the liberalisation of the <Col N="593" /> European aviation sector. It has resulted in more competition, new routes, greater variety, different ownership profiles of airlines and so forth. In concluding I emphasised that the Commission proposals for compensating airlines as a result of the US terrorist attacks fell short of the measures deemed by Ireland to be necessary to address the difficulties, particularly in light of the aid given by Congress to US airlines. In relation to concerns expressed about possible distortions in competition, having regard to the assistance available to US airlines which are in competition with European airlines, Commissioner de Palacio outlined that she had written to the US Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Minetta, to convey the concerns of the European Commission on this issue.</P>
    <P>Around the Council table the majority of Ministers either backed the Commission's limited proposal or agreed that some aspects of it should be eased, but only in a horizontal manner available to all airlines. There was a significant amount of negotiating on the Council conclusions and a reference to the &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; was included at my insistence. Members of the House have received a copy of the relevant conclusion on the general economic situation facing airlines. I hope we will revert to parts of it when the officials go to Luxembourg on Friday. The Council recognises the impact that the exceptional events of 11 September have had on the economic situation of the air transport sector.</P>
    <P>All in all, the position adopted by the Council yesterday is one which will make it a challenging task for Ireland to persuade the Commission that it should permit any form of direct financial assistance to Aer Lingus outside of the horizontal measures I have mentioned. We agreed with ECOFIN yesterday that domestic governments would continue to underwrite, on a month by month basis until the end of December, the enhanced insurance needs of airlines.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Aer Lingus survival plan which I received last Monday morning. The plan broadly confirms the key details which I outlined to the House last week, including the cash crisis it faces in January 2002. It sets out the various revised revenues and costs necessary to achieve viability and take account of the company's reduced scale of operations. It also identifies the need for a loan guarantee in respect of a working capital facility. In addition, Aer Lingus stated it does not have the cash to pay for a redundancy programme of any kind. Accordingly, non-</P>
    <P>repayable funding is requested.</P>
    <P>We have an extremely short timespan in which to find solutions to this critical situation and significant work will be undertaken in the coming week. The board is meeting tomorrow afternoon and I will also meet the chairman tomorrow. A team of officials from my Department will travel to Brussels on Friday to brief Commission officials on the general aviation situation pertaining to Ireland and the Aer Lingus restructuring package. We are also examining in detail every aspect of the Commission's guidelines for <Col N="594" /> state aid in order that we will be able to argue in the best possible way for any form of state assistance the Government may ultimately propose for Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I will prepare a report for Cabinet next week in which I will ask the Government to agree in principle to an Exchequer guarantee for a loan for Aer Lingus which would deal with the issues of redundancy and working capital. I cannot indicate at this stage what the recommendations will be on the funding requirements because that will be a matter for Government. In addition, whatever is decided by Government will be subject to agreement by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>I met the central representatives committee of Aer Lingus unions on 24 September and last Thursday, 11 October. I have assured the representatives that I will engage with them regularly in the coming critical days. I will meet them again this evening.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the survival of a fundamentally restructured Aer Lingus and the protection of the maximum number of sustainable jobs. However, that support is subject to the full and immediate implementation of the plan and approval by the European Commission. I will be perfectly clear. We face an extremely challenging task in obtaining approval from the Commission to provide assistance in any form to Aer Lingus, but I will work with the company and its employees to make the best possible case for securing the future of the airline.</P>
    <P>I welcome that a Fine Gael delegation comprising its Deputy Leader, Deputy Jim Mitchell and Deputies Owen and Richard Bruton will meet the staff of Commissioner de Palacio. I also welcome the statement made by the main Leader of the Opposition in Shannon last Monday evening. It is clear we are in a perilous situation and I welcome any attempt by anybody to help in regard to this plan.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for sharing her time with me and I regret having to eat into her slot, but I was unable to get any time from my Opposition party colleagues.</P>
      <P>The ability of the European Commission to respond effectively to the crisis in Aer Lingus is an acid test for us to know if it is there for the people of Europe or if the people of Europe are there for it. Some of us have been warning for a long time about the undemocratic nature of the European Commission. This is a time when we need democratic accountability, and the parties of this House are saying the European Commission needs to deliver a package that is adequate and satisfactory, which to date it has not been. This highlights the inadequacy of the European project to cope with the needs of workers. I hope that will change because a salient point in regard to outcomes of future referenda on the EU will be whether, when it comes to the test, the European Commission is able to deliver when people are in need. This is one of those examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going beyond the issue of Aer Lingus and the <Col N="595" /> European Commission is the need to evaluate the various contingency plans that have been put in place for many airlines in the United States as well as in Europe. When one reads those contingency plans, one realises there is a need for much greater flexibility in regard to Aer Lingus. For example, Delta has given its workers three options which are more complex than I have the time to go into now. It is important to take options and flexibility into account rather than to adopt a take it or leave it attitude. Each of the workers, not only in Aer Lingus but in the many industries depending on it, needs to be taken into account to ensure we do not jump the gun by announcing redundancies before we have had a chance to evaluate all the options. I fear that is what has been happening.</P>
    <P>A question that must be asked is what will be done to end the political appointment system in Aer Lingus. In restructuring the company it is hoped the Minister will not only consider the matter of the many workers who are in a perilous situation but will ensure that the management coming out of this crisis will be one with an expertise in aviation rather than one based on political patronage. It is crucial for every worker to know that. Why should the workers take the pain if management, who have options in banking and many other careers, are left in an untouchable situation?</P>

        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>This is one of the saddest and starkest debates we have ever had in this House. We are talking today about the survival or the death of a national institution. Aer Lingus is a cornerstone of Ireland. It is an integral part of what we are. It has been one of the pillars of Irish identity and a key element of our economy. For generations it has carried the flag and emblem of Ireland around the world. The name Aer Lingus has been synonymous with Ireland and with quality service and safety. While Aer Lingus has had its difficulties in recent years, nobody could ever envisage we would be talking today in such fatalistic terms. What is particularly disconcerting is the stark, uncompromising tones of the Minister for Public Enterprise that there is no room for manoeuvre, compromise or negotiation. As I speak, 150 permanent staff who are on probation are in shock as they examine their redundancy notices, which arrived in the post this morning. This is not a rescue plan or a viability plan but an ultimatum. The unions are being told to accept this deal, to accept 2,500 redundancies or else the airline will close down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael does not accept that 2,500 job cuts are absolutely necessary. It does not accept that cutting 40% of a workforce will guarantee the long-term survival of the company. This so-called <Col N="596" /> viability plan is not a kiss of life as it is being portrayed. Cutting a workforce by 40% is not a kiss of life but a kiss of death. It will cut the legs right out from under the company. It will have a major negative impact on the quality and quantity of the service and of the business. It is but step one of a phased but total closure of the national carrier. We will be left with a short-term small, weakened and vulnerable airline. The one thing the Minister and her Government colleagues should do is examine the figures for the poor survival rate of small airlines.</P>
    <P>I am at a total loss to understand European thinking. The dogged intransigence of the EU Commission that rules are rules and cannot be changed is absolutely suicidal. Contrast that to the attitude of the United States Government in terms of its determination to rescue its airlines. The United States had little hesitation in changing its rules to bale out its airlines, with $5 billion direct grant aid and $10 billion of loan guarantees within days of 11 September. Two of Aer Lingus's main competitors, Delta and Continental, have got multi-million dollar cash injections. That will completely distort competition. It is of little comfort to the House or to the Aer Lingus workers in the Gallery that it has been decided at Commission level to write to Mr. Minetta in the United States. Writing will have no impact. The result of the US decision will leave EU member states' airlines at a major competitive disadvantage and that will lead inevitably to further airline closures. How the EU can doggedly decide that it will retain its position of only very limited State aid is beyond comprehension. One has to ask if the EU is a political entity or a bureaucracy. One has to ask who is calling the shots. Is it the politicians or the bureaucrats? In this instance, and as happened yesterday, it is game, set and match to the bureaucrats.</P>
    <P>The difficulties Aer Lingus is facing today need not be terminal. Commercial aviation by its very nature is cyclical. It is subject to a variety of factors: war, recession, currency fluctuations, etc. There is no doubt but that the current difficulties being encountered by the world aviation industry are short-term and that inevitably a recovery will come. I am at a loss to understand why we are unable to put in place a rescue restructuring package which will retain the bulk of jobs in Aer Lingus and the company intact until such time as a recovery arises. It is worth bearing in mind that Aer Lingus made a group profit of £60 million in 2000. If it was profitable two years ago, surely it can trade its way back to profitability again. We are not only talking about 2,500 jobs but 2,500 families. We are talking about absolute disaster for those employed at Dublin Shannon and Cork airports.</P>
    <P>Yesterday was a bad day for Ireland and a bad day for Aer Lingus. The Minister has made no progress. The words &ldquo;challenging tasks&rdquo; arise in her script time and again. Having listened to her, it is obvious she was effectively told &ldquo;Go home, there is no joy, there is no consolation here.&rdquo; The <Col N="597" /> EU has a fixed position, it is not for turning and the writing is on the wall.  </P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for allowing me a few minutes. I have a terrible sense that this Government has talked into existence the failure to get help from the EU. Unfortunately, since we heard of the situation in Aer Lingus, we have heard nothing but negativity, for example, that 2,500 jobs must be cut or that 25% of service must be lost. I am not blind to the difficulties faced by the national airline and God knows I am touched by the problems in my constituency every day. If the Government has the will, it will find a way to achieve the approval and assistance that is possible. I thank the Minister for her gratitude to Deputies Richard Bruton, Jim Mitchell and me, who travelled to Brussels for four intense meetings last Friday. I left Brussels with the distinct impression that if enough serious heads were allocated to examining EU regulations, a way around the problems faced by Aer Lingus could be found.</P>
      <P>I will give one example of this. I have mentioned Article 87(2)(f2&gt;b), which deals with aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional circumstances. What case did the Minister for Public Enterprise make to the EU to prove that the week of 11 September was not the only time Aer Lingus was in difficulty? It is an indisputable fact that on 6 September, five days before the atrocities, Aer Lingus had devised a plan to save £30 million it knew it would lose as a result of foot and mouth disease and the economic downturn. That the plan was drawn up before the atrocities took place shows that Aer Lingus believed it could trade itself out of the difficulties that had been forced upon it.</P>
      <P>A second indisputable fact is that before 11 September, Aer Lingus had flagged that it was to lose £30 million in 2001, for the reasons I have mentioned. Immediately after the atrocities, the company readjusted its predicted losses to £74 million. There is clear and indisputable evidence that a loss of £44 million can be attributed to the exceptional circumstances that followed 11 September. I hope this case is being made by the Government. It is a case we put to Mr. Daniel Calleja Crespo, the head of Ms de Palacio's</P>
      <P>Cabinet, who took it on board.</P>
      <P>There is absolute and clear evidence that Aer Lingus was not a company about to collapse before 11 September. It had a viable future, albeit with some staff cuts which were not to be of the level now planned. I cannot understand how the Government and the management of Aer Lingus can announce 2,500 staff cuts without any reference to where the cuts will take place and without saying how the cuts interface with Aer Lingus's viability plan. The cart is being placed before the horse. The viability plan should be seen before deciding on the number of staff cuts, it should not be done the other way around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister for Public Enterprise accept that the success of the Cahill plan resulted from <Col N="598" /> the sacrifice and co-operation of the staff? I urge the Minister not to use threatening language to staff. As reported from Luxembourg by Conor Sweeney in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>, &ldquo;the Government last night told Aer Lingus unions they would have to accept the rescue plan or see the airline go under&rdquo;. It is grossly unfair to the staff of Aer Lingus that the axe will fall on them, not on the management or on the Government for its lack of success at EU level, if the company fails.</P>
    <P>What is the situation as regards a guaranteed loan? We were informed that the Government could give a guaranteed loan, provided it was at market investor level. Guideline 1999/C/288/02, under Article 87(f2&gt;c), deals with state aids. It states clearly that when determining if the injection of new capital by public authorities into companies which they own involves elements of aid, the criterion applied is the market economy private investor. It is my knowledge that the bank would have given a loan to Aer Lingus on 10 September. If that is the case, the Minister for Public Enterprise should use every section of EU rules to ensure our national airline is saved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The crisis facing Aer Lingus is one of the greatest economic and social issues that this country has confronted in many years. During debates on this issue in recent days, the importance of Aer Lingus to the social and economic life of this country has been well aired, to the extent that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, seems to be convinced of its importance. She has had a type of Pauline conversion on the road to Brussels. She is simply not credible on this issue. It is nothing short of a disaster that when Aer Lingus workers are facing their most serious challenge, they are saddled with a Government that has no belief in State enterprise. Of all the companies in the State sector, Aer Lingus has been singled out for particular vindictive treatment by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few hours ago in this Chamber, the Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, was forced to formally withdraw the Aer Lingus Bill, 2000, a Bill that was designed to tee up Aer Lingus for any form of privatisation. When it dawned on the Government that Irish citizens with money to spare will not invest in another disaster like the telecom flotation, it decided to flog the national airline to any corporate bidder prepared to buy it. The phrase &ldquo;trade sale&rdquo; was conjured up to disguise this grubby, nonsensical strategy. It made no economic or strategic sense and was solely driven by an ideological axis within the Cabinet opposed to State enterprise. Let there be no doubt that the destruction of the State sector is the over-riding goal of a group, led by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, who have a willing lackey to do their bidding in the form of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke. The uncertainty she caused greatly weakened the ability of Aer Lingus to deal with the crisis that emerged follow<Col N="599" /> ing 11 September. The blame is clearly at her door.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise's inability to direct policy in the State sector was abundantly clear in this morning's newspapers. As the 6,000 Aer Lingus staff contemplate a future which will inevitably involve job cuts, increased productivity without reward and huge personal sacrifice, the Minister decided to lecture them from Luxembourg. In a desperate attempt to disguise her responsibility to fight for a deal in Europe, the Minister declared that Aer Lingus workers, not the EU, will collapse the airline if the survival plan is not backed. Her remarks were arrogant, cowardly and irresponsible. Should anyone be surprised, however, as such qualities have been evident throughout Deputy O'Rourke's ministerial tenure since June 1997.</P>
    <P>Time and again during debates on Aer Lingus, I have urged the Government and Aer Lingus management to recognise that substantial change in the airline cannot work unless unions and workers are on board. Will the Minister confirm what Noel Dowling of SIPTU said to listeners on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today, namely, that unions have had no input into the survival plan? Will the Minister acknowledge that up to 90 permanent workers in Aer Lingus were this morning issued with redundancy notices, without any reference to their union and without seeing the terms of the survival plan? Does the Minister agree that the so-called survival plan is a private deal, struck behind closed doors between Aer Lingus management and officials from her Department, with her full imprimatur? Yesterday the Minister for Public Enterprise attempted to put a gun to the head of the Aer Lingus workforce and told them to shut up and put up, or else. Aer Lingus workers have been told to accept a survival plan they have not seen and on which they have not been consulted. No worker should be expected to sign a blank cheque, particularly when it is presented by a Minister and her senior officials, whose antipathy to Aer Lingus is barely disguised.</P>
    <P>During the negotiation and implementation of the Cahill plan, the workforce of Aer Lingus proved that it is willing to make tough decisions to secure the future of the airline. The workers have clearly demonstrated their commitment to the company, their understanding of the aviation business and their determination to see Aer Lingus play a leading role in European aviation. The Minister and the company's management have decided to throw this record of sacrifice and common sense back in the faces of the unions and the workforce. &ldquo;Mammy knows best&rdquo; is the attitude the Minister demonstrated towards the workers yesterday, but nobody believes that to be true. She failed to make any impact on the narrow and legalistic position being taken by the European Commission at yesterday's meeting of the Council of Ministers. This morning, she has sown seeds of mistrust and disbelief among <Col N="600" /> workers at our national airline. It is time she walked off the stage.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must now take control of our negotiations at European level. To date, apart from some soundbites delivered to the assembled ranks at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, the Taoiseach has studiously avoided taking responsibility as the national carrier faces its most serious crisis. Perhaps he knows that to do so would mean taking on the Harney-McCreevy axis at Cabinet that is opposed to the concept of state aid and is utterly opposed to the continued State ownership of Aer Lingus. We know from successive budgets that the Taoiseach either cannot or will not stand up to the diktats of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance. Will Aer Lingus become another testament to the failure of the Taoiseach to show leadership and to take a stand?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has two opportunities to assert his authority and to make the issue of state investment for airlines experiencing difficulties his political priority. He will meet the members of the European Commission today and later in the week he will meet all the European leaders at the Ghent summit. The Taoiseach should be on the telephone to every other EU head of state, leading a diplomatic and political campaign that prepares the ground for these critical meetings. Given the difficulties that many airlines throughout the EU are facing, he will find many allies among our EU neighbours, but this campaign needs leadership. This is the challenge now facing the Taoiseach. If necessary, he should indicate that co-operation on other matters could be dependent on the State, as shareholder in Aer Lingus, being allowed to provide sufficient investment to allow it survive with the maintenance of the maximum number of jobs.</P>
    <P>The current position of the EU Commission is legalistic. Anybody with an understanding of long-term policy goals of the unelected EU Commission will realise that certain Commissioners are using the economic turmoil in the airline industry, created by the murderous attacks on New York and Washington, to further their own agenda. Many in the EU Commission are determined to see a substantial reduction in the number of carriers operating in Europe and, without any moral qualms, they appear determined to look on the current situation as a window of opportunity to force through their agenda. It is both morally and politically reprehensible and we cannot allow Aer Lingus to become a victim of that untrammelled competition agenda.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the behaviour during this crisis of Mr. Michael O'Leary of Ryanair. On Sunday night, viewers of RTE were treated to one of the most stomach-churning examples of buccaneerism in living memory. As 6,000 workers and their families contemplate a grim future, we were treated to this doyen of Irish business wallowing in the distress of Aer Lingus. Mr. O'Leary appears to treat this crisis as just desserts for the <Col N="601" /> national carrier and he cannot resist any media opportunity he is given to gloat in public. Mr. O'Leary has been instrumental in establishing the most anti-union and anti-worker employment regime in the country. He is in no place to gloat as 6,000 workers face an uncertain future.</P>
    <P>Today, Sabena received EU sanction for a loan of 125 million from the Belgian Government to salvage the airline. Meanwhile, we have been told that the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, needs wriggle time. We know what use she will make of this time. She will wriggle to avoid responsibility and accountability for her failure to date. I am afraid the only use she will make of the time in the coming days is to target scapegoats for her own failure, notably the workforce in Aer Lingus.</P>

The Minister has failed. Time is short and it is imperative that the Taoiseach seizes control of this issue and ensures that a rescue package, agreed in the coming days with the unions in Aer Lingus, receives EU sanction so that the process of renewal can begin at the national carrier.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister agree that the Government as the main shareholder in Aer Lingus has the right to invest funds in the same way as a private shareholder has the right to invest funds in its airline? The Department of Public Enterprise and the Government are the main stumbling blocks because they do not want to do so. Does the Minister agree that, even if one accepts the strictures of the European Commission's policy whereby Government investment in Aer Lingus can only arise in exceptional circumstances, there is significant latitude for such investment because 11 September was not the only exceptional circumstance? The criminal bombing of Afghanistan which is preventing millions of people from taking to the skies is also an exceptional circumstance.</P>

      <P>Why has the Minister not fully involved the trade union movement in every aspect of this matter? Has she or the Government any proposals on the funding of semi-State companies in the event of a cash crisis?

Is she aware of how much of a focal point Aer Lingus is in terms of employment on the north side of Dublin? This area has suffered job losses in recent months through, for example, the closure of Gateway 2000. With regard to the survival plan, can the Minister provide assurances that proposed redundancies will be kept to an absolute minimum? As regards redundancy payments, can she indicate if a redundancy package will be as generous as possible, given the circumstances, and above statutory levels? </P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jim Higgins asked about the decision in relation to the 2,500 employees. The detailed plan I got on Monday morning laid out 2,100 job losses. I regret any job <Col N="607" /> losses. My life has not been about shedding jobs or trying to encourage that to happen. However, I am faced with a grim financial reality and would fail in my duty if I did not outline explicitly to the House, the public and the media the perilous situation facing Aer Lingus. It would be a different story if I tried to cloak it in soft words or evasive techniques. I cannot do so because the matter is serious.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked about the sectors. The plan, which the chairman told me will go to the board tomorrow, details the situation sector by sector. It has been explained in detail to and talked over with the financial advisers to the trade unions. Before I left on Monday morning I telephoned Dan Loughrey in Aer Lingus and asked him to ensure that begins on Monday. There is a section in the survival plan on changes in work practices. There is also a section on the changes in routes now and in the future.</P>
      <P>A question was asked about the redundancy package. The plan states clearly that Aer Lingus does not have any money to pay any redundancy, even of a statutory variety. That is a matter for political decision-making. I will bring it to</P>
      <P>Cabinet next Tuesday.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broughan also asked about the survival plan and if the workers have been informed. I answered that question in my reply to Deputy Jim Higgins. The financial advisers were informed of the details last Monday. When the plan is presented to the board tomorrow I understand management will start detailed talks. He also asked if other ways of lessening the blow of the redundancies had been considered. That matter will be discussed when management and the trade unions engage in face to face talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government wants to ensure the airline survives intact and that 4,000 jobs are maintained in Aer Lingus. One of the Government's aims is to maintain as many sustainable jobs as possible. As of now, that figure is 4,000. We wish to ensure the company remains viable. However, I cannot stand over a decision nor can I recommend to Cabinet that the airline should be allowed to continue trading in its present financial situation. <Col N="608" /> That would be an incorrect way for anyone in public life to do their business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey wanted to know if I was aware of the central force Aer Lingus holds in Irish life. I am so aware, particularly in north County Dublin.</P>

      <P>However, we must also include Cork and Shannon. Aer Lingus's main employment is in Dublin, but it sustains many jobs both in Cork and Shannon. It is important to talk about Aer Lingus in its totality. I understand Deputy Haughey represents that area and that is the reason he mentioned it. However, I do not want to be accused of not addressing the issue in terms of Cork and Shannon.</P>
      <P>I was also asked if management had been considered in the context of redundancy. There is a section in the plan which clearly states &ndash; it is emphasised in greater detail in a later section &ndash; that all grades from the top will be considered in this redundancy package. It also states that exceptions will not be made when the workforce and the redundancy packages are looked at in greater detail.</P>
      <P>It would be great if I was able to talk up the company because I want to keep and sustain it as I realise its importance. However, it is equally important that I am frank and straightforward about the perilous financial situation in which the company now finds itself. The chairman is coming to see me tomorrow evening and wishes to express his views and concerns about the present financial situation.</P>

      <P>I will co-operate. I remind the Minister that provision was made in the Cahill plan for a transatlantic company called Aer Línte to operate the airlines. Given that the competitors on that transatlantic route have received cash directly from the American Government, will the Minister highlight the fact that we are on the periphery of Europe and have sole transatlantic flights? Why can the Government not give cash to Aer Línte in the same way as the American Government gave money to its airlines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be total confusion about airlines and airports. Will the Government host an international or European conference in Shannon <Col N="609" /> Airport to devise a permanent aviation policy which would deal with both airports and airlines?

Will she ensure all aspects of the implementation of the plan will be first communicated to those involved? Does she agree that the daily transatlantic business service at Shannon is vital to the North American based industry in the west and mid-west? Any reduction in this service will have serious consequences for the west and mid-west.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept the impact analysis that if fares were to pick up by 10% in the next year, it would generate an extra £90 million and that, accordingly, the redundancy announcement is extremely premature? Is the new plan to end political appointments to the board of Aer Lingus?

Can she give us a commitment that there will not be involuntary redundancies in the company? What notice is she taking of the workers in all of this, and of their fear that this may be throwing out the baby with the bath water Given the size of the job cuts it may not be possible to have a viable, reliable service at the end of it. Is she taking any notice of the real concerns of workers in this matter? Will she attempt to reduce dramatically the number of job losses that are being proposed? Is the privatisation issue off the agenda? It has been suggested that Aer Lingus was asked to draw up a plan to reach profitability by 2003 and that that is somehow linked to possible future privatisation proposals. Will the Minister state categorically whether privatisation is off the agenda? </P>

      <P>When the Minister says Government support is conditional on the full and immediate implementation of the plan, is she saying there is no room for any alternatives to be put forward by the trade union representatives that would save money and avoid job losses? Clearly there is a huge divergence between the Minister's view, as expressed in her statement, and that of the company. She indicated that the company is seeking cash for redundancies and said this is a political issue which she will negotiate. Then, however, she said money will only be provided by Government, at best, in the form of loans to the company. She is saying the company's plan is conditional not on loans but on cash being made available. She says in her statement that it will be non-repayable but her reaction is that the best she will offer is loans. Is it not the case that the company will be debt-ridden going into the future? The company cannot stand over this restructuring plan if it is to be solely funded by loans.</P>

Will the Minister's officials please impress, particularly on an Italian commissioner, that State aid has been used for the past 50 years throughout Europe?

Would the Minister agree that political sniping is less likely to produce a positive result than political co-operation on all sides of the House? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is half a sentence which states that the support is subject to the full and immediate implementation of the plan. That does not suggest there is much room for negotiation. How much money is being sought by the company as a capital injection from the Government, and why does the Minister not feel she can commit herself to that one element of the plan which seems to require a Government decision, which is the provision of that capital?</P>

      <P>The Minister said the resolution to many of these difficulties rests in the political domain. Would she accept that, at EU Commission level and broadly at European level, she is now reaping the harvest sown by the Minister for Finance who, earlier this year, dumped all over the Commission when it introduced strictures on his budgetary policy? Would the Minister for Public Enterprise accept it is an error of political judgment for the main Government party to align itself with the arch-Eurosceptic British Tories?</P>

      <P>Who? Deputy Donal Carey asked for a seminar in Shannon and for cash for Aer Línte. I am quite sure a seminar at Shannon would be helpful. The idea of putting cash straight into Aer Línte would not be allowed. Deputy Neville asked that the implementation of the plan should be made clear to the unions, and that Shannon is vital to the west and mid-west regions. I fully agree that it is. There is no doubt that all the State airports are vital but I know the importance of Shannon to those regions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sargent asked about the pick-up in flights from cheaper fares and, yes, there is a pick-up in flights. However, there is no return to the company from each of those cheaper flights which have been advertised and to which people are responding. They represent an attempt, and I hope a successful one, to attract people back to air transport. Deputy O'Sullivan asked about future privatisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on the questions to be included on the 2001 census form in May 2000. This decision followed widespread consultation by the Central Statistic Office in early 1999 supplemented by a pilot test carried out in September 1999. The inclusion of a question on ethnicity was considered to be a sensitive issue and the controversy it might cause could have had a detrimental effect on census response rates. Furthermore, the question being proposed was formulated at a late stage and consequently had not been pilot tested. On this basis, the Government decided against inclusion of the question. The Government decided instead to include a specific question on membership of the Irish Traveller community and a question on nationality. These additional questions, taken in conjunction with questions on country of birth, religion and country of last previous residence will provide comprehensive information on minority sub-populations.</P>
      <P>Because of the foot and mouth outbreak the Government decided in March of this year to postpone the census from 29 April 2001, to 28 April 2002. The same questionnaire will be used in 2002. The CSO intends to resume working with the relevant representative groups on a question in relation to ethnicity in the lead up to the 2006 census.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and express deep regret that the Government is refusing to avail of necessary scientific data. Does he accept there is a pattern here? More than ten years ago when the CSO was asked to do a census on the number of people who were divorced or separated, it refused to do so on the grounds that it was not Government policy. Later this month the Government will launch its campaign to combat racism. How can we have a proper campaign if we do not know the precise numbers? What is the real reason for not including this on the census form? The Minister of State has a direct responsibility for this area and I am not talking about the operation of the CSO, I am talking about Government policy. Does the Minister of State want to find out the extent of the change in the nature and composition of this society? There is no more scientific way of doing that than by conducting a census. It is not too late for the Government to change its mind and have a suitable question inserted on the census form. I am disappointed that the Minister of State cannot see a way to address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="615" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly want to address it and it will be addressed. It is really a question of when it can be addressed satisfactorily. It was decided to include a question on ethnicity. That was discussed with the consultative body that was established which drew from 16 groups around the country, including the public service. It was also discussed with the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism and the Equality Authority. They agreed to a revised wording of ethnicity offering the choices &ldquo;white&rdquo;, &ldquo;black&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; and so on. When this commenced in the UK they got into serious difficulties because they offended a large number of groups who felt they were not included or did not like the descriptions of their background included on the form.</P>
      <P>When the Government examined this, a number of Departments raised issues which had not been addressed by the proposed question. For example descriptions such as Romany travellers, Asians, blacks from the Caribbean or blacks from Africa were not included. Rather than give offence, it was felt it would be better to simply make a start. Question six on the form asks the respondent's nationality and offers the responses of &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; or &ldquo;other nationality&rdquo;. Question 12 asks the respondent's religion and offers options such as &ldquo;Roman Catholic&rdquo;, &ldquo;Presbyterian&rdquo;, &ldquo;Islam&rdquo; and so on. There are also questions about last place of residence and place of birth. The view was that it would be premature to go down the road Deputy Quinn is suggesting. I agree with him, however, that we should seek to gather that information.</P>
      <P>The alternative would have been to put in an open-ended question. The contracts have been signed for the census next year and the forms are ready. The open-ended question would allow respondents to describe their ethnicity, but the CSO tells me that gives rise to logistical problems. The whole basis of the census is to list something that covers the majority and then insert a box for &ldquo;others&rdquo;. An open-ended box for &ldquo;others&rdquo; would cause enormous logistical problems. I want to get to the same place as Deputy Quinn. I am advised by the CSO that it would be premature to do it now because there is no agreement on how it should be done. The original idea was to insert a box for &ldquo;black&rdquo;, but it was felt some people might be offended by that or feel it did not cover their ethnicity.</P>
      <P>It raised a lot of questions in the UK, which I think have been finally resolved. A large number of groups were offended in the UK. We believe we should continue to work with these various groups.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his long and apologetic reply. I do not accept, however, that he wants what I want. I know the Department of Finance. I know it refused to take a census on the number of people with disabilities for fear of the cost implications. I know there is no census on the numbers of carers. If the facts <Col N="616" /> are not known policies cannot be produced. We have a problem with racism, we have a delayed programme&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister of State if he agrees with me. He made a long supplementary reply. We have a growing problem. We have dealt with that in having to deal with our people in Britain. Does the Minister of State agree it is paradoxical that the Irish Government argued with our British colleagues to include a description in their census that would enable the Irish in Britain to be measured in their census? Which is more important, the prospect of giving offence to a small group of people or getting the facts as to the changing nature of our society? Does the Minister of State agree that, on balance, the prospect of getting the facts is a better option for policy makers than the possibility of causing offence in private to those who read the forms? Other than not being prepared to measure the facts, one has to conclude the Minister of State has given into an assumption of offence being given rather than the reality of facts being gathered. If one good thing has come out of the foot and mouth outbreak, it is that it is not too late to change the form. The cost of doing so could be substantial, but nothing like the £150 million the Government has already spent on consultancy services in the past four and a half years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>To return to the question, the Department of Finance is not calling the shots on this, although there are cost implications of several million pounds. I am advised by the Central Statistics Office. I accept the Deputy's point that the Government takes the decision on whether to take that advice. It has chosen to do to so on this occasion. Apart from the policy points, which I have already explained, I have been advised there is very little room for manoeuvre at an operational level. The contracts were placed after an open tender procedure, the hardware and software are in place and the work is in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the policy area, the Government is of the view that it would be premature to proceed with this now. Instead, respondents will be asked their <Col N="617" /> nationality, from which we can glean as much information as possible. We will continue to work with the various groups to enable us to deal with the matter properly in 2006.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Government mean when it states the measure would be premature? Does it mean it might measure the numbers of people of different races in this country, but not at the present time? What does premature mean, if not that? Why can the Government not do it now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in explaining the matter because the Deputy does not want to listen to me. I have explained the reason we cannot do it now and the meaning of &ldquo;premature&rdquo;.  It means we have not concluded the discussions with the various groups involved to the extent that the Government is satisfied that offence would not be taken. The reason we cannot do it now, as I have explained, is that there are operational problems. I am aware the Deputy does not accept those reasons, but it is my job to explain them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Deputy whether he accepts that explanation. That is the operational level. At a policy level, it is the Government's judgment that the new question on nationality, combined with the previous questions on religion, place of birth and country of residence prior to taking up residence in Ireland, will give us a substantial picture on this issue. We can move later to getting a full measurement of ethnicity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The census does not have to take place for five months. Could the Minister of State not pilot test this questionnaire in the intervening period? Would it not be quite easy for him to pick up the telephone and call his counterpart in the United Kingdom to ask what system has been agreed with all the ethnic groups in that country? Is it not hypocritical for the Government to make a case to the British Government that the Irish should be included as an ethnic group on the British census when we are not prepared to introduce a similar measure? Would it not require just a small amount of programming to change the software to allow the additional questions to be asked? The Minister of State stated the question on nationality in the CSO questionnaire will help resolve the ethnicity issue. Let us take an African-American. He or she may be Roman Catholic, hold US citizenship and have resided in the United States prior to coming to Ireland. None of the questions referred to by the Minister of State tell us anything about such a person's ethnic background. The only way to get that information is to put the question on <Col N="618" /> the form. The excuses the Minister of State has given do not hold up.</P>

      <P>The current UN and EU national accounting methodology specifically excludes from the national accounts the value of unpaid work, including unpaid social work. Thus, the value of such work is not reflected in GDP. Any estimate of unpaid social work in the annual accounts would probably have to include unwaged social work done both inside and outside the home. The measurement of the extent of these activities and their valuations present substantial theoretical and practical problems. However, the international standards do make <Col N="619" /> provision for and encourage the development of so-called satellite accounts in which subject areas which do not form part of the formal national accounts framework can be addressed. Some countries have made a start on developing a satellite account that would capture voluntary work, at least in terms of hours worked, if not monetary value.</P>
      <P>One of the main tools which has been developed to provide the basic raw material for this purpose is a time use survey, in which the hours devoted to unpaid and paid work are measured. The CSO conducted a pilot exercise of this type in 1997 to test the feasibility in the Irish context. The pilot was successful and the CSO accepts that there is a valid basis for conducting a time use survey. However, in view of the relatively high cost of undertaking a time use survey and the many other competing statistical priorities for the CSO, there are no arrangements to hold such a survey. The CSO has indicated that the matter will be kept under review in consultation with the National Statistics Board.</P>

      <P>I have noted from the statement by the chairman, in the latest annual report of CIE, that he has estimated the cost of gridlock to the CIE Group to be £40 million or 50.79 million a year in operating costs. However, he has also stated that the significant investment in public transport being made under the national development plan has begun to yield benefits. This investment is going towards extra services and extra capacity in both rail and bus as well as improving quality bus corridors and a new light rail system for Dublin.</P>
      <P>In his statement, he also described in detail the progress made. Since that report, further progress has been made and more can be expected in the coming years as further projects are delivered. The most notable projects are the delivery of an additional 12 DART cars later this year or early next year, the first delivery of 80 diesel rail cars next year, the completion of the Luas project in 2003 and the delivery of additional QBCs. Since the NDP was launched, good progress has been made in expanding public transport and giving it the priority it deserves in tackling urban congestion.</P>

      <QRef>[24522/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a statement to the House earlier today in relation to yesterday's transport council and the situation in Aer Lingus. In summary I said I would prepare a report for Cabinet next week in which I would ask the Government to agree in principle to an Exchequer guarantee for a loan for Aer Lingus which would deal with the issues of redundancy payments and working capital for the airline. I cannot at this point indicate what recommendations I will make to Government on the funding requirements. This will be a matter for Government to decide. In addition, whatever is decided by Government will be subject to agreement by the European Commission. Moreover, any Government decision will be critically subject to agreement on the survival plan.</P>
      <P>At yesterday's Transport Council meeting, the majority of Ministers either backed the Commission's limited proposal in its present form or agreed that some aspects of it should be eased but only in a horizontal manner available to all airlines.</P>
      <P>There was general agreement that we should not assist in dealing with the pre &ndash; 11 September problems of inefficient airlines. I concur because that was not the situation with Aer Lingus. I emphasised to the council the exceptional nature and impact of the events of 11 September on Aer Lingus, how it would be wrong to reward terrorism by allowing any EU airline to collapse because of 11 September. I warned against any agenda to hasten consolidation of European airlines on the back of the terrorist attacks. There was a strong case made by Stephen Byars of the UK Government that we should use the opportunity to have consolidation of airlines. Four or five of us strongly resisted that suggestion. I emphasised the importance of Aer Lingus to the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>This morning I advised the House that there was a significant amount of negotiation on the council's conclusions and that a reference to the exceptional circumstances was included at my insistence. I will quote the relevant conclusion on the general economic situation facing airlines:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council recognises the impact that the exceptional events of 11 September have had on the economic situation of the air transport sector. Control of State aid being a matter for <Col N="622" /> the Commission, it takes note of the Commission's communication on the repercussions of the terrorist attacks in the United States on the air transport industry. It emphasises that any targeted aid is subject to approval by the Commission, in accordance with Community competition rules and State aid guidelines taking into account in a clear and objective manner the consequences of the closure of certain parts of the airspace in the four days following 11 September 2001. Beyond that period and in relation to the issue of airspace closure, the Commission will examine on a case by case basis the compensation which would be granted on the basis of objective criteria to make up for restrictions imposed to European airlines by the country of destination. Any aid or compensation may not lead to distortion of competition between operators.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>We face an extremely daunting task in obtaining approval from the Commission to provide assistance to Aer Lingus in any form other than the limited horizontal measures already proposed, but I will work with the company to make the best possible case to secure the future of the airline.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that she failed miserably yesterday to effectively make the Irish case to assist the national airline which now needs assistance? Will she also accept that the damage done by the Minister before 11 September to the company, by her prevarication on the ownership issue left Aer Lingus in such a weakened state that it was not able to deal effectively with the crisis that arose after 11 September?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The terrible events of 11 September have had a huge effect on the travelling public. This in turn has affected airlines. We take no joy in the fact that every day there are media reports of the loss of confidence of the travelling public in air travel. The last report I received from the recently deceased chairman of Aer Lingus was dated 6 June. It stated that the airline was forecasting a loss of £25 million for the end of the year. That was due to foot and mouth disease and the economic slow down. That was expected to be overcome through trading in 2002. At the beginning of September the company proceeded to put a limited plan into action which I have no doubt would have overcome the trading difficulties of 2001. Post 11 September the situation has altered dramatically both here and throughout the world with regard to the travelling public.</P>
      <P>It would be nice if I could come here with soft words for Aer Lingus. I have great admiration for Aer Lingus, for its workers and its management&mdash;</P>

How much money will the Minister seek from the Government for redundancy payments? We need to know the amount involved &ndash; the Minister will shortly ask the House to vote for it. Will that money be regarded by the EU Commission as state aid &ndash; money for redundancies &ndash; and will it be in the form of cash or a loan? I understand the plan refers to cash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the first commitments I gave, when appointed Minister for Public Enterprise in June 1997, concerned the post office network. I promised that there would be no forced closures of post offices. My position and that of the Government has not changed since then. We remain committed to a viable and competitive post office network. Two reports on the post office network &ndash; by Phil Flynn and by an interdepartmental group &ndash; both concluded that the post office will face serious challenges in the next few years. They forecast accumulated losses in the post office counter service over the four year period 2001-04 at nearly £80 million, based on current tariffs and the existing network structure. Clearly, the scale of these losses is unsustainable.</P>
      <P>The Government, having considered both reports and the scale of losses forecast, accepts, along with all interested parties, that substantial restructuring is required if a viable sustainable post office network is to remain. The Government approved the following measures: An Post need to focus in the short-term on the introduction of pilot postal agency arrangements; the Government agreed to increase the share capital of An Post by £10 million on the basis that this would facilitate the implementation of the overall package of reforms; and in situations where it is impossible to continue a post office service on an agency basis, a Government services outlet network will be developed.</P>
      <P>In August, I met the Irish Postmasters Union to discuss the matter. I agreed to its proposal that a forum of interested parties would facilitate negotiations on reform and Phil Flynn has agreed to chair that forum. The first formal meeting of the forum took place on Monday 11 October. The payment of the increase recommended for sub-posters recommended in the Flynn report will be made at the earliest possible date. Discussions have ensued between the company and IPU and I expect payment will be made within the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know and fully appreciate the work undertaken by postmasters and postmistresses over the <Col N="625" /> years, in terms of providing excellent services to the customer, particularly in rural areas. The postal directive has also enshrined that. I am committed to ensuring that the public service ethos offered by the post office network will remain.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that the PostPoint system, which is now being introduced by An Post, will close many sub-post offices, by stealth, by removing many of the services which they currently provide. Does the Minister accept that? Does she also agree the pilot postal agency and the £10 million share capital will not be enough to ensure the viability of sub-post offices? What discussions have taken place between the Minister's Department, An Post and the commercial banks on the operation of a universal bank account? What response has the Minister had from the banking sector to her request for a financial contribution from them for the services now provided by An Post in relation to payment of bills, which has been withdrawn by the commercial banks? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Competition Authority has intervened in the bill-pay arrangements which had been set up on a global bank basis between An Post and the bank institutions. On a one-by-one basis, An Post is now seeking to implement bill-pay arrangements and, clearly, post offices will be paid on foot of each such payment. With regard to the postPoint arrangement, it is now a year since that was initiated between An Post and the various outlets. If that had not been done, competition was about to come in and that would have wrenched that business away from An Post, without any recompense. That was quite clear, the details are readily obtainable and I can give them to the Deputy. postPoint is now available in 1,000 post offices and sub-sets of it are available in all post offices. I must emphasise that if An Post had not moved on that matter 12 months ago a nationwide competitive element would have been introduced.</P>
      <P>In the forum, for the first time, we now have An Post, the Irish Postmasters and Postmistresses Union and officials from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and my Department. This facilitates a very open discussion on what extra work the post offices should get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government should also be included in that forum, as it has a role to play in generating income in sub-post offices. Have costings been produced on the new Government services outlet network and how does that compare with the current costings of the sub-post office network? postPoint was sold on the sole basis that many of the services currently provided by the sub-post offices will be available through postPoint early next year. In small rural villages, <Col N="626" /> with three postPoint outlets as well as a sub-post office, there is no way a sub-post office can remain viable and compete.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy's point about the Department of the Environment and Local Government. That Department has been invited, as has the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, to make its submissions to the forum. That is one of the issues about which they will be talking.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about the Government outlet. That only comes into play where there is no post office or where there is no take up by a suitable candidate when there is a vacancy and where an area would lose a post office. It is clear that the best arrangement would be the continuation of a suitable man or woman who would come forward to &ldquo;person&rdquo; the post office. That would be the best arrangement. From time to time, that is not possible because nobody is interested or nobody comes forward. It is under that circumstance that a Government outlet will be explored.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>the timeframe for taking legal action in the European Court of Justice following the decision of the British Government to sanction the production of MOX at Sellafield; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the UK Government's decision of 3 October 2001 to give the go ahead to the Sellafield MOX plant, the Irish Government is now finalising consideration of further legal options against the UK under both EU and UN law. The question of action in the UK Courts is also included in that consideration. This would be in addition to the legal <Col N="627" /> action already under way under the OSPAR Convention.</P>
      <P>I will not pre-empt the Government decision on which avenue to pursue. Clearly, the time frame and the opportunities for early relief of the various legal options will be deciding factors which will influence the Government decision in this respect. Although I understand it may be some time before the plant is commissioned, it is imperative that we move swiftly and in advance of any such commissioning and this is what we are doing.</P>
      <P>On the specific question put by the Deputy in regard to the timeframe for proceedings in the European Court of Justice, I understand that at present it can take up to several years for hearings in that court. If the Government decides to pursue the EU legal option, I am advised that from the date on which Ireland files its complaint, the European Commission has up to three months to respond. After that proceedings may issue to the European Court of Justice. Once proceedings have been issued, I understand it would be open to Ireland to apply for preliminary relief pending the outcome of the hearing. However, in the current circumstances, where it seems that early action is imperative, it is possible that the European Court of Justice path may be less immediate than our current needs dictate.</P>
      <P>However, at this stage I will neither pre-empt the Government decision, which is before it, on this matter nor close off any of the appropriate legal avenues open to Ireland. If necessary, we would be prepared to pursue all of these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the legal and scientific sitting on hands that has occurred over the past four years had the effect of giving a free hand to the British authorities to go ahead with the commissioning of the MOX plant at Sellafield? Does he agree that the flurry of activity we are now seeing is, by and large, window dressing with no real substance? Will he tell the House if the Government is serious about tackling the British authorities on this and if it will go to the High Court in London next week to seek a High Court injunction preventing the British authorities from proceeding with this until the case is heard at United Nations and European levels?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the former part of the Deputy's question. Nobody knows better than Deputy Stagg the intensive campaign that has been waged by this Government and by previous Administrations against the commissioning of MOX. Other parties and groups have engaged in intensive activity in this regard. That includes five rounds of public consultation processes in which Ireland put forward very strong, potent presentations. That has delayed this evil day until the recent announcement.</P>
      <P>This legal action the Government is taking is not a knee-jerk reaction &ndash; it is something on which we embarked last June well in advance of this announcement. Going forward with those actions, which were authorised by Government when I put it to it last June, was accompanied by a request to British Ministers not to proceed with the commissioning of MOX until that process of action had been completed. We are very disappointed and astonished that that request and demand was not adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House would agree, although the Minister of State may not, that I am being damned with faint praise by saying I was as active on this issue in that portfolio as the present Minister of State. Does the Minister of State agree that the commissioning of this MOX plant, given the attempt by some forces in the world to start a world war at that time, is a teeing up of the Sellafield plant as a target for terrorist attack? It is shining a light on this place for a terrorist attack. Does the Minister of State agree with that? Does he agree that if there were a terrorist <Col N="629" /> attack &ndash; it would be very simple to organise an attack of various sorts &ndash; if the highly active liquid waste stored at the plant were to explode and if we were unfortunate enough to have wind in our direction, agriculture in Ireland would be wiped out indefinitely, probably for 10,000 years, and that many Irish people would die regardless of what plan the Minister of State might have for reducing the number of deaths? Have any studies been carried out in his Department or by the RPII on his behalf to indicate what would be the effects of such a disaster at Sellafield? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always acknowledged the work and the efforts of previous administrations, particularly the one previous to ours and the work of Deputy Stagg in this area. I agree with him that this has substantially escalated the concern we have always had and expressed in regard to Sellafield. We have had many concerns and areas of concern in regard to the activities in those installations. We have always articulated that our main concern is the possibility &ndash; regardless of how remote &ndash; of a serious accident or incident at Sellafield with the resultant chaotic situation which it would cause in this country because of our close proximity.</P>
      <P>As regards this announcement in present circumstances &ndash; world terrorism and what is happening in other countries, particularly the United States &ndash; it is totally irresponsible of the British to escalate the situation there and to allow further expansion of nuclear activities at Sellafield. We are totally against that and are doing everything possible in this regard. The Taoiseach entered the arena on this recently. He has said publicly that he will use every means humanly possible, including legal means, to prevent this from going ahead. That is the Government's stance on it.</P>

      <P>The national development plan includes a provision of £150 million for the purchase of 20 new mainline carriages, the upgrading of stations and the provision of new railway plant and equipment. In addition, 58 diesel rail cars, at a cost of approximately £90 million, are on order for delivery in 2002. These rail cars have the facility of serving both mainline and outer suburban services. Irish Rail also intends funding an additional 22 rail cars from its own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from Iarnród Éireann that it is <Col N="630" /> now also considering the purchase of some additional carriages over and above those provided for in the national development plan.

      <P>Does the Minister agree that many of these carriages are more than 30 years old and in urgent need of replacement? Does she also agree that the capacity on the mainline routes leaves much to be desired, that trains are very often overcrowded and that at times Iarnród Éireann cannot cope with the demand? Has Iarnród Éireann asked the Minister or her Department for any funding and, if so, how much?</P>

      <P>I agree that busy services are often very crowded. That is a result of people's wish to get off crowded roads and use public transport. As I said to Deputy Jim Higgins earlier, the transition period is much longer than one might have thought. However, my job is to bring the infrastructure on stream. A total of 80 new diesel multiple units are on order for delivery in 2002, of which it is intended that 58 will be EU-NDP funded, while the balance of 22 will be funded from Iarnród Éireann's resources.</P>

        <b>:</b> Buses have a maximum load factor which is binding and mandatory, and which it is an offence to breach. In the case of trains, there is no maximum number and the result is that there are so many people crowded onto the Westport and Dundalk-Drogheda trains that they resemble the Calcutta express. This is a tragedy waiting to happen. Would the Minister, therefore, consider making an order restricting the number of passengers who can be carried in a railway carriage or wagon?</P>

Does the Minister accept that more than carriages are needed to provide capacity, that we also need track capacity in which investment is long overdue? Is there any plan to provide increased track capacity? When might this come on stream, particularly in the Howth Junction and Dublin city centre area, which has to cope with the various radial routes coming into Dublin?

      <Quest>if she has satisfied herself that the introduction of competition in electricity will still result in a reduction in electricity costs in view of the recent decision by the Commission for Electricity Regulation.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, I should point out that I do not have a function in relation to electricity pricing. Under the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations the Commission for Electricity Regulation has been given the function of examining electricity charges in the segment of the market not open to competition and, where necessary, issuing directions to the ESB in relation to both the nature and amount of such charges. By virtue of the Electricity Regulation Act and the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations, a new regulatory regime has been established in Ireland.</P>
      <P>On the broader question of costs, liberalisation of the electricity market is expected, in due course, to exert downward pressure on prices and lead to increased efficiency and improved levels of service. All large businesses and many medium-sized businesses are &ldquo;eligible customers&rdquo; and as such are free to source their electricity from any licensed electricity supplier.</P>

      <P>The Minister has a function in this matter, but has simply dodged it or wriggled out of her responsibility by not giving a clear policy direction to the regulator which she has an absolute responsibility to do. Is it believable, given what we have been through with the ESB in terms of getting rid of 3,000 jobs to prepare for competition and establishing the regulator, that the only thing that can be done by the regulator in the interests of competition is to increase prices? The ESB was doing such a good job with reduced prices that it would not pay the private sector monopolies from other countries to come to this country and compete with the ESB. Is it believable that we are presiding over a situation where prices must be increased to promote competition? I thought the opposite should be the case.</P>

All correspondence between Mr. Reeves and the Department is on the Department's website and <Col N="634" /> is accessible to everybody. Similarly, submissions to the regulator are on his website and are equally accessible.</P>
      <P>I am aware that ePower has decided to leave the electricity market. On the evening the company made that announcement I spoke with Mr. O'Brien's colleague and he explained that there were many reasons for the decision. Some of them are those mentioned by the Deputy but there were other reasons. We have liberalised the market and there is already competition. In three years the market will be fully open and all customers will be free to source their own supply of electricity.</P>

      <P>I should point out to Deputy Naughten that there will be a fuller answer on this issue later. I am aware that the postPoint service is an issue of major concern to postmasters and postmistresses and that there has clearly been some misunderstanding as to the background to the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 2000, An Post won a contract from Eircell to install and operate 4,000 credit card terminals for payment purposes in that company's network of &ldquo;Ready to Go&rdquo; agents. The implementation of this service, subsequently branded postPoint, has been under way since October last year and approximately half of the retailers that <Col N="635" /> have a &ldquo;Ready to Go&rdquo; agency have been connected to the service. Had An Post not been successful in winning the contract, it would have been set up and operated by competitors. Such a payment service is already provided by An Post through the company's network of 1,000 automated post offices and An Post considered this crucial to it winning the contract. I am also informed that Eircell's top-ups are available on an over the counter basis at non-automated offices.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply. Can she give the House a categorical assurance that An Post is not targeting retailers to incorporate a postPoint in their outlets, although there is nothing wrong with that, and promising retailers a range of postal and electronic based transition services? Can she give an assurance that it is only postPoint in regard to the topping up cards for 086 and 087 mobile telephones and that this is the only function An Post is promising retailers when the service is agreed and is to be installed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year, the Government decided, in principle, that the gas network should be extended to the north west. An evaluation carried out by Bord Gáis has determined that this would require grant aid, as the demand for gas in the long-term would not be sufficient to pay for the capital cost of extending the system. Such grant aid would require State aid clearance from the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>Last month the Government announced</P>
      <P>that it was moving ahead with the next stage in the project which is to conduct a detailed study on extending the gas network to Sligo <i>via</i> Ballina from the proposed Mayo-Galway pipeline and to Letterkenny from Derry, which is expected to be served by a pipeline from Belfast. Bord Gáis is being asked to carry out this study, the purpose of which is to fully define the pipeline extensions and to give an accurate assessment of the levels of grant aid that would be necessary. At the same time it is proposed to submit a State aid case to the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>The level of grant aid depends on the balance between the capital and operating costs of the extension and the estimated gas demand in the new area being served. The initial indications are that considerable grant aid would be required. It is necessary at this stage to define the pipeline extensions in greater detail so</P>
      <P>that an accurate level of grant aid can be identified.</P>
      <P>I understand this phase of the project will take about six months to complete, following which the issue of grant aid will be considered again by Government, provided the necessary clearance has been obtained from the European Commission. It would take about two further years after that to complete the pipelines.</P>

        <b>: </b>Has the Government at any level, the Minister of State's colleagues or has he working in conjunction with his colleagues put together a plan to exploit the resource for the benefit of this region that has been starved of jobs, development and industry? Is there a coherent strategy in place from the point of view of industrial development? Is his Department aware of any application or interest in exploiting the gas resource by way of an ESB electricity generating station or a privately owned one?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an exciting and positive development for the west and north west. Even though the national development plan did not mention extension of pipelines BGE plans to spend 254 million in the BMW region on the Dublin-Galway-Limerick ring main and on the Mayo-Galway pipeline over the next two years. In addition, the Government has decided to embark on plans to further the development of the infrastructure. Industry will be attracted to the region by this development. Every chamber of commerce, county council and urban council is literally screaming for extension of this infrastructure to its area in the definite knowledge that it will attract commercial and industrial activity.</P>
      <P>This decision has been taken and this will happen. My function is to ensure that the decision of the Government is implemented and that the work is accelerated to enable this other work to follow on immediately when the ring main and the Galway-Mayo pipeline are in place.</P>

BGE has a scheduled completion date of late 2002 for the ring main and August 2003 for the Galway-Mayo pipeline. The preparatory engineering work to be done by BGE and the business in terms of State aid to be conducted with the EU Commission can be done in tandem with the main work. Those preparations for the extensions of the infrastructure can be made and will follow on from work on the ring main and Galway-Mayo spur line.</P>

      <P>Deputy Higgins will be aware there are plans for an electricity generating station at Coolkeeragh which will help with the economics of bringing gas to Letterkenny, as distinct from the costs of bringing it on a South-North route along the western seaboard.

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 12, 31 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>One of the first commitments I gave when appointed concerned the post office network. I promised there would be no forced closures of post offices. The answer to this question is more or less the same as that which I gave in reply to Deputy Naughten's earlier question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> This question asks if the Government has decided to embrace a rationalisation plan which will lead to the closure of up to 900 sub-post offices. The Government has not decided to embrace a rationalisation plan. No such rationalisation plan has been put to me or to any of my colleagues in Government nor did I go to Government with a plan proposing the closure of 900 sub-post offices.</P>
    <P>I referred to the Flynn report. In July the Government approved the following measures: that An Post needs to focus in the short-term on the introduction of pilot postal agency arrangements; and it also agreed the figure of £10 million. Where a suitable man or woman does not come to run a post office where a vacancy has occurred, a Government services outlet will be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>The reason this issue has come to the fore, that the IPU is lobbying on this matter throughout the country and that there is an impression that the axe is about to fall on these 900 sub-post offices goes back to the fact that the performance of An Post management has been absolutely abysmal and pathetic. There has been a failure to exploit a fraction of the available commercial opportunities. Smaller post offices and sub-post offices have been effectively starved of a range of services that would make them viable. If vision and foresight had been demonstrated, we would be talking about substantial profits, not losses of £80 million.</P>
      <P>As the main shareholder in the company, does the Minister support the concept of enabling post offices and sub-post offices to offer current accounts? Customers could lodge money, have cheque books and pay bills. Does the Minister accept that there is a huge window of opportunity as a result of the abandonment of the people when the commercial banks withdrew bill paying facilities? Customers must now lodge before they can withdraw. We do not want to ape the United Kingdom, but from time to time they do things better then we do. Does the Minister accept that the British model demonstrates how post offices can become substantial profit generating enterprises? This would be possible if the management of An Post had the foresight, determination or interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not underestimate the fact that elements within An Post have sought to close post offices during the last decade, going back to the first PricewaterhouseCoopers report when Deputy Séamus Brennan was the relevant Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember vividly that the closure of many post offices was proposed and that similar proposals were made in another report in 1994 or 1995. I accept that An Post is <Col N="640" /> going about its business with regard to liberalisation and that it is looking for other opportunities, but it has a long-standing agenda with regard to small rural post offices. I do not share that agenda and neither has any Government which has been in office in recent years. A forum, chaired by Phil Flynn, is bringing the IPU, An Post and the Government together and I hope sustainable ideas will emerge.</P>
      <P>Returning to the matter of bill paying, An Post announced an arrangement whereby it would take over many bill paying activities after banks pulled out of rural areas. The Competition Authority has stepped in to stop the plans, however, and investigations are under way. I accept fully that lots of work could be done by post offices, as people feel assurance and confidence when dealing with them.</P>

      <P>My next question relates to the £10 million increase in the share capital of An Post to which the Minister referred. Effectively, it is being provided to pay for the 12% increase for postmasters. Can the money be paid before the forum has completed its work and before agreement has been reached? Can EU clearance take place before the package of radical reform, as the Minister described it, has been achieved within An Post?</P>

      <P>The Irish Postmasters Union has been involved in both meetings. I attended a meeting a week ago to greet all involved. The first meeting had been held a week previously. I saw and spoke with representatives of the IPU. When I was in Brussels I addressed the matter of the £10 million, which is not regarded as State aid in the same way as other matters are. My queries received a favourable response. In the meantime, An Post has agreed to pay £10 million, pending the receipt of the money from the Government in due course. The arrangements for payment will be discussed by An Post and the IPU next Monday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two matters with the Minister. She said that the board of An Post has had a long-standing agenda to close many sub-post offices. I do not think anyone would dispute that. Does the Minister agree that the board should resign, given that its views are contrary to hers and in the light of the fact that An Post is selling the PostPoint system to ensure the service provided through the sub-post office network will be provided through the PostPoint system from 1 <Col N="641" /> January 2002? Does she agree that a new board which is prepared to look at the commercial viability of An Post should be appointed?</P>
      <P>Second, can I briefly raise the matter of the Competition Authority? As I understand it, the authority is examining possible anti-competitive practices in relation to the agreement between An Post and banks. What anti-competitive practices can there be in a village like Glasson or Knockcroghery? Who will compete with post offices in such small villages throughout the country? Is it not time for the Competition Authority to concentrate on other areas where issues of competition unrelated to small villages need to be tackled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Competition Authority has its own remit to decide what should be done. It is not my responsibility, but that of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I do not agree that the board of An Post should resign as it is a good one. I accept that management in An Post has a long-standing agenda as it does not want to see its operations needing to be subsidised. My belief, which is shared by other Ministers whose files I have seen, is that another way to viability is to offer an increased level of services, as Deputy Jim Higgins argued. In that way, I hope post offices will no longer need to be subsidised. No Government, including any incoming one, can stand over a four year forecast of losses of £80 million, which is the reason there is haste to get the house in order and plans together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that the payment by An Post of the 12% increase is contingent on An Post receiving an increase per transaction from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs? Does the Minister know whether her ministerial colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is prepared to make such an increased payment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's opinion, if An Post does not make payments, where can they be made? No other authority is cashing social welfare payments. Does the Minister agree that a <Col N="642" /> redundancy scheme needs to be put in place for elderly postmasters and postmistresses? Younger staff could be retrained to ensure that a change in the ethos of An Post takes place and new services are provided. Finally, is the sole function of the board of An Post the implementation of Government policy? If so, should the board not have ensured the future viability of the sub-post office network? This has not happened to date. Will the Minister agree that the board should resign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the board should resign. An Post has a great deal of flexibility and independence to do its work under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983. I agree that redundancy payments are being sought by a number of postmasters and postmistresses who would like to retire if given a suitable redundancy package. It is one of the matters being addressed by the forum. The Department of Finance has undertaken to be part of the forum that will consider the issue.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also asked who else would make social welfare payments and I agree with him. It is a safe, reliable and private place where people can get their social welfare entitlements. As the Deputy pithily asked, who else could do it in Glasson or Knockcroghery, although they are sizeable places? However, I doubt other outlets would be as reliable as the post office regarding social welfare payments. Nevertheless, I did not initiate the complaint in Europe. Obviously, somebody else did it.</P>

        <b>:</b> Will the Minister revert to my original point regarding the attractiveness of a current account type system in the post office that would compete with the banks? My belief is that if such a system was introduced, there would be a mass withdrawal of money from the banks. People would consider such a system very attractive.</P>
      <P>To demonstrate how outmoded the post office has become and how it has failed to move with the times, one cannot pay a bill in the post office with an Access card, a Visa card or an American Express card. Such cards are not accepted because post offices make up their accounts on a weekly basis while Access, Visa and American Express operate on a monthly basis. However, they will accept payments with a Laser card.</P>
      <P>An Post is talking about losses but it has a war chest of £168 million. Does the Minister agree this money should be used by the company to put in place a viable, energetic and imaginative development plan instead of the type of negative vibes that are emanating at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The company accumulated its war chest through sound business ideas it implemented and then sold at the right time. It had two Internet businesses that it sold at just the right time. I salute its dexterity in that regard, <Col N="643" /> which raised capital for the company. It intends to expend this money on large mail centres around the country. Interestingly, the amount of money it wishes to spend matches the amount it has at its disposal.</P>
      <P>The company is right not to raid that money, but it is a matter of will in terms of An Post realising that no political party, either now or in the future, will favour the demise of post offices. If that factor was fully absorbed by the company and worked into its thinking and operations, it would realise that is the way forward.</P>

        <b>:</b> Is the Minister aware that, in the letter she received from the power company in question, Viridian, and the chief executive, Mr. David de Casseres, he referred to the fact that recent press articles have described him and his Huntstown project as the last man standing in the process of market liberalisation? It is the only independent company still in the game. Is the Minister aware that one of the primary obstacles appears to be regulation 31 under the Electricity Act, 1999, which provides for a transitional period ending in 2005? This means the ESB does not need to purchase any electricity from independent suppliers, regardless of price and environmental benefits, unless or until it has exhausted all its own capabilities to produce power. Does the Minister agree this is a major deterrent and obstacle to companies coming into the market and staying in it given that they are entitled to have a profit motive?</P>

It pointed out that while it might bring short-term benefits, it would be negative in the longer term. I admire the work being done by Viridian and the huge financial investment it is making to ensure competition in the electricity market. However, the commission did not recommend its idea, pointing out that while it would bring short-term benefits, it would be negative in the longer term.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that companies which wish to enter the market in Ireland should build their own power stations, as Viridian is in the process of doing, and then get their own customers? Does the Minister agree the company with which they are competing, the ESB, should not be obliged to take either their surplus or all their electricity unless it wants it? Does she agree that the commission is right to tell Viridian to get its own customers? The marketplace has been created for it to do so and I hope the Minister agrees nothing else should be done for it.</P>

I had some sympathy for the Viridian people when they discussed the matter with me, but I do not have sufficient knowledge regarding the extent of its proposals. In any event, the commission said it was not a good idea and I am glad the Deputy approves of what the commissioner said.</P>
      <P>However, I hope Viridian will become a strong competitor because every trading company needs good competition. It is often difficult when a monopoly is moving into a competitive arena to mix the two elements. However, in general, it is better that competitors in all markets set up their own stalls and proceed to sell.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I will not argue with Deputy Stagg's point but the real problem is that the ESB's final tariff prices are significantly below cost. This means that companies such as Viridian are effectively in a position where they must sell electricity at a loss to enter the market. It is fine saying that companies should get their own customers but when one is competing with a monopoly, a tariff price that is below the cost of production is a major problem.</P>

There are always ups and downs in any arrangement where a service that was a monopoly becomes liberalised and enters a market. Most of us appreciate that the entry of Viridian is good for the market. I hope that, in time, its diligence and efforts will bring it the <Col N="645" /> rewards for which it has invested large sums of money.</P>

Luckily the capital investment programmes for Shannon and Dublin Airports, which were agreed during the Deputy's time in Government, have been completed while a similar programme has recently commenced in Cork.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>A second terminal is a different issue. However, it could well be provided by Aer Rianta or another developer but the issue is always approached from the wrong perspective. It is addressed in such a fashion that one person could develop the terminal. That could not happen because there would have to be a public tendering process, planning permission would have to be sought and the entire process would have to be followed through. One could not award a terminal franchise, which is such a valuable resource, to one person without careful consideration.</P>

      <P>I seek an assurance from the Minister of State that when the Ordnance Survey office is privatised there will not be a dramatic increase in the cost of maps. There will be increases as a result of inflation and so on but I am afraid the subsidy that is currently available will be reduced dramatically over the next few years and the board, which will have a commercial remit following the enactment of the legislation, will be directed to sell the maps everywhere it can and at whatever price it can realise. At the end of the day the only way the board may be able to recoup its expenses is through price increases.</P>
      <P>The Ordnance Survey office will not have many competitors and I am unaware of any other company which is engaged in the production of maps. Many Members want an assurance when the Minister of State replies to the debate that prices will not increase in such a fashion. I do not know what type of guarantee could be accepted because everyone appreciates that times are changing rapidly but this issue is a concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not completely <i>au fait</i> with the new technologies in the Ordnance Survey office but computer and satellite equipment that could not even <Col N="648" /> have been dreamt about a few years ago can now be utilised. However, I am aware of procedures in the area aid unit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Every acre of land in Ireland is now digitised and because of the use of satellite technology the unit can photograph every pocket of land, no matter how small it is. I assume the Ordnance Survey office could avail of similar technology and, if so, significant commercial opportunities will present themselves for the office. I foresee a large market developing with the aid of this new technology. All of us must appreciate that commercial remits make such bodies tick nowadays but I am afraid that, while a better system may be developed, maps may cost two or three times their current price. All maps cost money, whether one is applying for planning permission, a drainage scheme or a natural habitat scheme. However, one cannot do without them as they are fundamental.</P>
    <P>I hope every effort is made to ensure that under the new commercial remit the mapping of less prosperous areas of the country, such as bogs and mountainsides, is available at the same unit cost, although it will probably cost more to map them. We have always had a problem with out of the way places which were not mapped in the past. When I hear that a map must be drawn I cringe because that means it will be 12 months before anything happens. I understand that in the new ordnance survey system many of the landmarks, such as ESB lines and gas pipelines, will be factored into the new maps. I am sure the new road system will also be factored into it.</P>
    <P>We were lucky in Tuam in my constituency to get one of the local offices. It is not a big office, but it is important. I accept that the decentralisation of the Ordnance Survey Office is important. I could not understand how the ground work would be organised in Dublin, but that did not happen as the offices were decentralised. The Minister of State said in his speech that the area offices will not be downgraded as a result of this legislation. Perhaps he could clarify that in his reply.</P>
    <P>As regards the staff, I have not been contacted by any member of the staff. However, it appears the staff are not happy with the Minister's proposals, although he seems to think they are in agreement with them. If I was a civil servant in any of the Ordnance Survey offices, I would like to think that whatever career path was available to me would still be available under the new system and that if I wanted to move in or out of the system, I would be allowed to do so. That type of flexibility is important, particularly for the people who nailed their colours to the mast and decided to work in a local office because that is where they want to live. We cannot blame people for worrying about being moved from one office to another or about the numbers who work in a particular centre being dramatically reduced. I assume the Minister has given much time and thought to this issue because it cannot be done without the staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> The general thrust of the Bill appears to be correct. However, the commercial aspect must be taken into account. There may be day to day problems under the new system. I remember on a number of occasions when there were problems in the Ordnance Survey Office, such as delays in mapping, we could raise the matter in the House. Will it be possible to debate such issues in the House under the new system because they will be of direct relevance to everyone? It would be a huge mistake if we allowed a situation to develop which meant we could not do that or which allowed a Minister to say it was not possible to answer a direct question on a matter because of the new system and status of the body. The Ordnance Survey Office did not take up much time in this House because it performed its duties well. However, there is always the possibility that a member of the public might not be satisfied with it. Our parliamentary system should allow us the opportunity to raise the matter.</P>
    <P>I find favour with the main thrust of the Bill. I assume that once the Minister gives an undertaking, there will not be any adverse effects on the decentralised offices throughout the country and the staff will buy into it. If that is the case, there will not be any problems with this legislation.</P>

      <P>When the Minister of State opened the debate, I was delighted to hear him say that staff associations had welcomed the idea of setting up the Ordnance Survey Office as a State body. Some of the speakers in the interim seemed to indicate they did not agree with that. I am aware the Minister met some of the bodies in recent days and that many of the issues which were causing concern among the staff have been addressed or are about to be addressed.</P>
      <P>There was some surprise in many circles that the idea of moving the Ordnance Survey Office from within the ambit of the Civil Service was being mooted at this time. I understand the idea has been floating around for almost 20 years and that a proposal or recommendation dating back to at least 1985 suggested that the service would benefit greatly if it was removed from the Department of Finance. It is clear there were some constraints on the development of the service in recent years which stunted its growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staff representatives have had recent meetings with the Minister and many of the issues have been progressed. Sections 15 to 17 of the Bill address many of the concerns raised by speakers, some of whom spoke as if these sections did not exist. Many people spoke about the potential loss of Civil Service status and the difficulties that might create and the fact that people should be given the opportunity to transfer. However, those concerns were not raised by the <Col N="650" /> staff to whom I spoke in the Ennis office and in one other office. They were more concerned that the regional offices might come under threat in the future. They made the reasonable point that a regional spread of offices for a service, such as ordnance survey, is an enormous advantage for undertaking the type of work required.</P>
    <P>People tend to think that mapping work is almost complete because more land is not likely to appear. However, they tend to forget about the sub-division of properties, particularly in terms of road building and the construction of houses. There are also huge demands in the area of agriculture, as was stated by previous speakers, and in a number of other areas where map making must be up to date and new technologies have come into play.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation was mentioned by a number of speakers. I got the impression from what the Minister of State said that it is unlikely the Phoenix Park headquarters will remain there in the long-term. In the event that decentralisation becomes an issue for its headquarters, we would welcome it in Clare if that opportunity presents itself.</P>
    <P>The current staff have done a wonderful job in addressing the issues and using the latest technology in dealing with their workload. It is also clear that the Ordnance Survey service has the potential and the capacity to expand and develop dramatically. If this Bill facilitates that, which is clearly the intention, then it will be a good day's work.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State made it clear that the Ordnance Survey Office will continue to fulfil its current role in mapping and providing ancillary services for the Government. This will be done under a service agreement for public functions provided for in section 25. That is the only role Government needs to have concerning the Ordnance Survey and it is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 allow the Minister for Finance to give policy directions and additional functions to the new company. We may revisit that area with the Minister at some future date when we wish to move in one direction or another as regards particular policy matters.</P>
    <P>During the debate Deputies referred to the wonderful work undertaken by the original map makers from the establishment of the Ordnance Survey in 1824 and onwards over the subsequent 150 years when today's modern technology was not available. The huge amount of material that has been made available over the years should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides an important right of access to premises for the staff to carry out their functions. There are situations in which that right may be extremely important so I welcome the fact that it has been clarified and properly provided for in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Archaeological records have been preserved from original maps but, unfortunately, while in many cases the records have survived archaeological monuments have been damaged. Neverthe<Col N="651" /> less, it is important that records remain so that we can preserve as many of these monuments as possible for the future.</P>
    <P>I hope in its new role the Ordnance Survey will be able to play a more central role in mapping underground services, particularly in built up areas which have a huge level of such services, including electricity, water and sewerage. By and large, these services tend to have been very poorly mapped. It would be a huge addition to our knowledge base if all these services were properly located on maps. I hope the Ordnance Survey will take an interest in this matter which, though it might prove difficult, could bring great rewards from interested customers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the changes in the status of the OSI as proposed by the Bill. I compliment the Minister on his approach to preparing the legislation, and the length of time he took to discuss the issues that could arise. The passage of the Bill through both Houses gives Members an opportunity to pay well deserved tribute to the work of the staff involved, including those who participated in such good mapping over the generations.</P>
      <P>The general public is not too familiar with the work done by the Ordnance Survey. Maps appear for public use but we seldom question their provenance. It should be stressed just how important is the Ordnance Survey's work. In many walks of life it is of critical importance and it is only right that we should acknowledge that fact.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killeen raised the interesting issue of mapping underground services such as gas, electricity and telecommunications. The most annoying aspect of this matter is the repetition of road digging by service providers. The matter could perhaps be examined with a view to co-ordinating the work of local authorities and the Ordnance Survey. In Cork city, the corporation has a relatively new computer programme into which it can feed most of these services, but the rest of the country does not have such a facility and, consequently, it can be chaotic. It is a demonstration of how we could open things up a bit more.</P>
      <P>A small number of issues has been raised repeatedly during the debate, which indicates how carefully the Bill was prepared. Many contributors mentioned the fears of the Ordnance Survey's staff and it appears that there has not been too much discussion with those involved. I got the same impression as Deputy Killeen, that the staff are concerned at the idea of centralising the service and getting rid of the regional offices. It is essential to have regional offices so that the service can be provided locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about any misgivings of the staff of the Ordnance Survey's regional office in Cork. Those misgivings should be dealt with as clearly, positively and speedily as possible. I have spent most of my adult life in a semi-State company so I can understand more than most people how any proposed changes in status, structure or <Col N="652" /> conditions can lead to great concern. The concern that has been expressed relates to the possibility of centralisation. It is no harm to air this matter and to examine it.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the changeover be carried out in a positive and business-like way with the maximum employee participation. The Minister spent quite some time in his opening remarks explaining how that had occurred.</P>
    <P>My party colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern, referred earlier to changes in the approach to worker directors, and he is quite correct. Putting in place representatives from any outside group or affiliated body, regardless of their involvement in other things, is no substitute for direct worker participation. Surrogate worker directors are totally unacceptable. There seems to be a consensus now, as Deputy Noel Ahern indicated, on the sources for these worker directors, although it is not all concerned with political placement. When everyone else in the partnership approach agrees on such change, it is important to keep an eye on the original thinking behind the concept of worker participation. That was that people on the site, who knew what was happening and were in touch, would have a say in the future of a company. They understand what is happening and can feed that back to the work force who would be involved in decision making. It will be important to maintain that sort of thinking in future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the indication on the future commercial role of the OSI. We keep hearing that there is massive potential through information technology. With the upgrading of mapping techniques, the OSI is in a better position to compete in a commercial market and I wish the Ordnance Survey well in that regard. All possible options should be examined so that the OSI will have an opportunity to participate fully in the market place. Just because a State service is being provided it does not mean the company has to become a lame duck; it must be given the opportunity to succeed commercially.</P>
    <P>I would sound one note of concern, however. I understand the OSI's staff have powers to enter upon private lands and premises in carrying out their functions. They are authorised to place their sovereign marks on land, which is an essential requirement because the job cannot be done without that facility. Bearing in mind the recent reaction of the IFA which has been able to prohibit statutory bodies &ndash; both local government workers and employees of the National Roads Authority &ndash; from operating, is the Minister satisfied that section 10 will not be used to prevent the ongoing work of the OSI? Recent events are regrettable, but do we need to examine other areas? In light of the IFA and court challenges, is the Minister of State satisfied that he can make section 10 stick?</P>
    <P>I welcome this change. We could examine other State and semi-State bodies with a view to dragging them into the real commercial world. Assistance and facilities will be needed. One of <Col N="653" /> the difficulties in the past was that the premises in the Phoenix Park was inadequate. I hope this matter will be addressed in any proposals and I am sure the Minister of State will deal with this issue. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and compliment the Minister of State on his work. Very few complaints were raised by the Opposition or the Minister of State's colleagues and I commend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. We all recognise that maps have a widespread application at this stage in our history. Apart from their use in planning and area aid applications, they are also of value for historical research purposes. Maps are an important primary historical research tool. I know a number of people involved in academic research whose concerns I will refer to later. However, they regard historical maps as an important aid to historical research.</P>
      <P>The Ordnance Survey has provided maps for about 177 years. Is this not an opportunity to examine the totality of maps going back hundreds of years? Has any effort been made to collect these maps? These are historical documents, some of which are very expensive. The House is discussing the heritage fund at present, but important maps of this country are located throughout the world. Perhaps an effort should be made to bring them back to Ireland and, perhaps, to place them in the National Archives.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State confirm whether OSI will transfer all its maps and plates to the National Archives? A considerable amount of data is already in the National Archives, but will the Minister of State confirm whether all of the historical research will be transferred? How far back does the material in the National Archives go? Some of the old copper plates are 200 years old and are of considerable value. These are precious items which should be preserved. Any such material should be stored in the National Archives.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers referred to the major changes which have taken place to the landscape in recent years. OSI produces maps on a six monthly basis which is an important service given the changing nature of the landscape.</P>
      <P>I was a history teacher and maps were one of the tools I frequently used. Children can relate to maps through which they can see the changing face of their local communities and landscapes. On field work exercises I would send children into the local area to see where houses had vanished and populations had declined and disappeared. Maps tell a story and are a critical primary source of information for researchers, history teachers and schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During debate on this Bill in the Seanad, Senator O'Toole referred to the educational aspects of the legislation. Preferential treatment should be given to schools which require maps for educational purposes. The new organisation will be a commercial entity and will have to make <Col N="654" /> money. However, when schools and academic researchers require maps they should be accommodated as far as is possible.</P>
    <P>I know some of the cartographers in the Ordnance Survey who have no problem with this Bill. The more money which can be generated, the more secure their jobs will be. The more commerically-oriented the new company is, the better for them. Some people have expressed concerns that this will be a private company, but that will not be the case. The company will operate on private sector principles, but it will still be owned by the State which will continue to have a major say in how it is run and will provide subventions.</P>
    <P>The concerns of staff largely relate to decentralisation. About 200 people work in the Ordnance Survey in Dublin. Their work is highly specialised and the cartographic grades are very specific. These people would face difficulties if they wish to stay in Dublin and have to transfer to other Departments. If OSI is to be decentralised I would bet it will go to the Minister of State's county. That may be incorrect, but it would be difficult to recruit staff from other Departments because of the specialty involved. Such a move would not be similar to decentralising an agricultural or social welfare office. OSI's work is highly specialised and technical and it would be difficult to replace its staff if the office was decentralised and these people did not wish to leave Dublin. That option is open to all civil servants. However, if OSI staff choose not to go they will have to move to other Departments which have different requirements and it would be difficult for them to adjust.</P>
    <P>A number of issues have been brought to my attention by people who are in regular contact with the Ordnance Survey and who are familiar with it. I do not know whether their information is accurate, but I will put their questions to the Minister of State. Someone recently demonstrated to me how inaccurate the digitised boundaries are and informed me that it was necessary to contract a different company, at extra cost, to correct the discrepancies. The boundaries of townlands, DEDs and counties have been digitised. However, rather than digitising the cumulative boundaries of the relevant townlands within a DED, the outline maps of each DED were digitised separately using a different scale of one quarter of an inch to a mile to establish the boundaries of DEDs.</P>
    <P>That was done presumably from the county index to the 6 sheets, the scale of which &ndash; depending on the size of the county &ndash; is one quarter or one third of an inch to the mile. When these boundaries, digitised at different scales and each with its own specific factor of error, are superimposed on the computer screen, they do not coincide. The discrepancy may not affect the use to which many users of GIS put the package. However, when the image is enlarged to a scale relevant to the requirements of a user for whom precision is essential the discrepancies can be catastrophic. This was demonstrated to me and I <Col N="655" /> estimate that the image had a discrepancy of between 30 and 50 metres. This would mean that a feature situated in a townland in one county would appear well inside the boundary of a neighbouring county, likewise within a DED. I would like the Minister of State to offer some clarification.</P>
    <P>It seems to some that this is symptomatic of the attitude of the Ordnance Survey since it focused on the large-scale commercial contracts for revenue generation some 20 years ago. The same attitude is revealed in the production of maps by photocopying and later by computer print-out where poor quality paper is subject to erratic distortion by heat or moisture. This, apparently, led to court cases some years back where structures planned on a map were found to have extended to a neighbouring property.</P>
    <P>There is a two-tier mapping system in place. There are large-scale metric maps which have been available since the mid-1970s. The bulk of large-scale maps are still in the old imperial measurements of 6 and 25. This refers particularly to places in the west like Connemara and parts of County Kerry. Metric maps are available for urban areas and their catchment areas as well as areas of high grade farming land. The imperial maps are outdated. I think the maps of the Aran Islands date back to the middle of the 19th century. Inhabitants pay the same price for maps, whether they are in the imperial or metric systems. It is quite unfair that this should be so. Some of the information on the imperial maps is quite inaccurate. To correct and use these maps would require considerable extra expenditure.</P>
    <P>I am aware that forward planning in County Kerry has been curtailed because planning officers have been unable to base proposals on existing maps due to the misleading representation of landscape features in environmentally sensitive locations &ndash; usually areas where mapping has been neglected. There is a lot of forward planning in County Kerry &ndash; I am sure the same is true elsewhere &ndash; but it is certainly being hampered in some cases because of the unavailability of metric digitised maps.</P>
    <P>I understand a resurvey of rural Ireland is ongoing and due to be finished in two and a half years. It is very important that financial resources are provided for the Ordnance Survey to complete this as soon as possible. I am sure the problems which I have outlined are widespread. The new mapping is almost exclusively dependent on aerial photography which speeds up the process enormously. However, with the cutting back on final checking on detail through fieldwork, there is a loss of precision. This is especially true in the case of structures whose roof area is larger than the actual footprint on the ground. Significant discrepancies have been noticed. If an aerial photograph is taken of a house which has a roof with a wide span, it can distort the actual footprint on the ground. This can lead to many problems. I understand there are only six or seven field<Col N="656" /> workers in the whole country. With the rate of building we have witnessed, we could have a lot of houses mapped but with the wrong footprint. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to any discrepancies? Have there been many queries about them?</P>
    <P>There is concern expressed about the paper used in reproducing maps. The paper used in Ordnance Survey maps from the outset was of very high quality. Many maps were works of art and are quite valuable. The use of such paper was to counter irregular expansion and contraction of paper in different atmospheric conditions. That cannot be said of the paper currently being used and distortion can be considerable. I recognise that printers cannot use heavy vellum, but the use of such non-resilient paper is something that should be looked at.</P>
    <P>The Ordnance Survey has a very advanced geographical information system. Consideration should be given to academic and research licences in a variety of cultural areas, whereby the country's heritage can be elucidated in a manner unattainable without recourse to GIS. The results of such research could reveal unexpected commercial potential for the subsidiary companies envisaged in the Bill. Ireland led the way in the 1830s in being the first country to implement national mapping on a scale as large as 6. The millions who comprise the Irish diaspora, especially in America, and Ireland's popularity as a cultural and environmental tourist destination could provide the basis for products targeted at these, given the initial creative effort. There should be preferential treatment for cultural and genealogical research. There is a 20% reduction in cost for universities seeking maps. This should be increased. There is a huge interest in genealogy, particularly in America. People visit the local church and genealogical centre, but they want to see the footprint of the ancestral house if the house is no longer standing. That is reason it is important that people have access to this information at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>As regards place names, the pressure under which the GIS and its ancillary database of place</P>
    <P>names was developed led to some unfortunate results. Place names which had been accidentally misspelled on survey maps and in the topographical index of townlands were included in the database without correction. I ask the Minister of State to address this. As to the ramifications of computerisation, it will become more and more difficult, given the rigidity and permanence required by such systems, to eliminate these misleading mistakes. In other words, what system is in place to correct the place names which have been spelt inaccurately in the database?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and thank and compliment the Minister for introducing it. He has introduced a vast raft of legislation since coming into this job, for which he ought to be complimented. It should also be recognised that the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, established the interim <Col N="657" /> board under the rainbow Government. We also deserve some credit, therefore, for this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, on his <i>tour de force</i>. The depth of my knowledge does not equal to his. He provided a very interesting discourse on the role, function and importance of the Ordnance Survey, particularly from the point of view of local history, culture and tradition. Ordnance Survey Ireland is one of the great historical parts of the Civil Service. It is humbling to reflect on the fact that it has existed in almost the same form for so long having survived British rule, the War of Independence, the Civil War and two world wars. Perhaps, therefore, after such a long time in its current form, it does no harm to reflect on ways in which it can be changed and improved to place it on a firm footing for the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the necessity to look deeply and thoroughly at the Ordnance Survey, I am a little concerned by the almost undue haste shown in changing some traditional Civil Service roles into either commercial or semi-State bodies. This extends across all Departments and, perhaps, all political parties. I appreciate the interim board established in 1997 proposed the introduction of this legislation and indicated it would be difficult, if not impossible, to give the Ordnance Survey a greater commercial role without first introducing the legislative changes we are now debating. Nevertheless, I am slightly concerned by that kind of thinking.</P>
      <P>The past ten to 15 years have seen a huge change in the way we look at State enterprises and boards as well as the Civil Service as a whole. Perhaps we have too readily arrived at the cosy consensus that huge change is required to the way in which work is performed and to the ownership of companies from the perspective of privatisation. I appreciate this legislation does not entail the privatisation of Ordnance Survey Ireland or anything remotely of that nature, but I wonder how we can ensure its real role from a map making perspective, which is of huge strategic national importance, can be fully preserved when we are simultaneously telling the organisation it must have a strong commercial focus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning we debated the crisis in Aer Lingus. During such debates, to which no doubt we will frequently return in the coming weeks and months, the point is always made that a national asset cannot be entirely commercial and there must always be room for State aid. The Ordnance Survey has been a national asset for over 170 years. We must reflect on the fact that it has a huge national role to play from an economic and social perspective. While it is imperative that the job of the Ordnance Survey is done in the most cost effective manner possible, I am somewhat concerned that we feel obliged to change its structure in order to place these new requirements on it. It would portray defeatism and weak thinking on the part of politicians if we have reached a <Col N="658" /> consensus that bodies currently within the full remit of the Civil Service such as the Ordnance Survey cannot do their job properly or effectively without changing their structure. I welcome privatisation and change of ownership in many areas of State control, but it is not absolutely necessary that everything has to change.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to explain the reason he and his officials, as well as the previous Government, formed the view that the commercial necessities of Ordnance Survey Ireland could not be guaranteed under its present structure. They received advice that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to do so. Why is that the case? Why can an organisation which has stood the test of time for over 170 years not be able to adapt within its present system of management? Again, I concede the change proposed is quite modest and does not amount to creating a fully commercial or privatised agency. However, I seek assurance that this is not change simply for change's sake. Will the Minister assure us that the important national development role played throughout the decades by the Ordnance Survey can be maintained to the same degree and to the same effect within its changed structure?</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Deenihan, referred to staff levels and decentralistation. No one has spoken more often than the Minister of State about Government plans for decentralisation. I trust the commitment he gave some months ago to announce the decentralisation programme in the autumn will be fulfilled. I appreciate that the type of extensive decentralisation programme proposed by the Government and supported by every political party in the House can be difficult to get up and running. However, it was expected over 18 months ago. There have been numerous statements announcing it would start the following month or the month after that. We want progress.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate his latest thinking on the matter and the position of the OSI <i>vis-à-vis </i>prospective decentralisation. To judge from his thinking several months ago, the programme would have been launched by now and an initial phase of towns announced. While I appreciate there is more to it than announcing ten or 12 towns, the silence has been somewhat deafening. There is a political as well as a general economic and social side to the argument. I welcome the fact that the original Government proposal to announce ten or 12 towns in an unseemly rush 12 or 18 months ago appears to have been vetoed by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. I trust the Government's programme will be implemented for good social and economic reasons. While there will be some degree of political consideration &ndash; as always happens in the affairs of state &ndash; I hope the political considerations will be well down the line when the towns are being selected. I have taken the opportunity of this legislation to say a few words about the <Col N="659" /> need for progress on the decentralisation proposals.</P>
    <P>I have no fundamental difficulty with the legislation. I am concerned about our consensus that there must be dramatic change in the manner in which all State boards and State agencies operate. I hope this is not change for change sake.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify why it is necessary to pass this proposal? Could the Ordnance Survey in its present incarnation not do its work from a commercial perspective? What guarantees can the Minister give that the main role of the Ordnance Survey &ndash; which is not commercial, it is much greater than any commercial activity &ndash; will continue unhindered when the new management is told to operate with a view to a break-even or even a profit situation? State ownership should not be regarded as a sacred cow, but we should not throw in the towel in relation to our Civil Service and its operation.</P>
    <P>No political party appears to be opposing this legislation and it will be passed, but we should reflect on our rush to change how the Ordnance Survey does its business, particularly as it has served the State well for more than 170 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this important Bill. Deputy Bradford made a very good point. The Ordnance Survey office has served the nation very effectively for 170 years. I am a supporter of private enterprise but it is important to acknowledge the huge level of commitment and dedication of the staff. They have done outstanding work. Many members of the staff are wondering what will be the advantages of the change in the role of the office. The electoral register still retains the same format as 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with the concerns of the staff in the Sligo office. There are 19 members of staff, most of whom are married with families, in the Sligo region office of the Ordnance Survey. They are using the latest technology and years of experience to produce the OSI latest product, the first truly 3D map in digital format at a scale of 1:5000.</P>
      <P>That office has done outstanding work and the staff are very dedicated. They are concerned that having been at the forefront of developing this new product it could now be outsourced to foreign companies and they will be forced to compete with companies in low wage economies. Competition is the life of trade and it is a competitive world, and that is what the Minister proposes. The staff are also concerned that the new phrase being used by the OSI management &ndash; fit for purpose &ndash; means that the OSI plan to dumb down on its standards possibly because the foreign outsource companies cannot achieve the standards currently employed by the staff of the OSI. The Minister should address that concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation allegedly offered to staff about the change of status was not consultation but a series of information meetings where the <Col N="660" /> staff were told what was going to happen. They were not asked to make an input and no heed was taken of them. Will the Minister confirm that is the case? I would be very disappointed if that were the case. It is important to have consultation with staff.</P>
    <P>People are concerned about leaving the security of State employment for private enterprise. If there were information meetings instead of consultation with staff, that would be contradictory to the Government's preference for openness and transparency. This will be a major change for staff because they are leaving the security of the public service and moving into the deep blue sea. It is important that guarantees are given.</P>
    <P>The recent staff questionnaire, already quoted in the House, shows that the staff do not support the change of status. It is important to have happy campers working in any business and to have a good team working with management. The private enterprise ethos of management is of a team working together and that is also the new thinking in the public service. It is important that the least skilled member is part of that team. Equality of treatment of all staff is very important and I would be disappointed if this decision were taken without serious consultation with staff.</P>
    <P>The staff are also concerned that their 20 plus years of service and their loyalty seems to count for so little in the changes being made. Will that loyalty be recognised in the new structure? Will there be a gratuity payment or a golden cheque paid for years of service? Will the new agency incorporate new staff or will there be a new marketing team? The names of deceased people still appear on the electoral register. I know the Ordnance Survey had been working with the post office to update its database, whether urban or rural based. Account must also be taken of the development of the national spatial strategy and the population changes which are taking place. There is no substitute for the &ldquo;foot soldiers&rdquo; on the ground in providing accurate information. That we have massive technology does not ensure that the information we get is totally accurate.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State appears to take an added value approach to the Ordnance Survey, in terms of sourcing new business and a more commercial approach to the pricing of existing services to the public and private sectors. Will the Minister of State expand on what he intends in that regard? Where does he see the new customers? How were the existing customers looked after and what was their level of satisfaction? Was the post office using the existing service? In the new service, does the Minister of State expect the post offices to be used as an information base? With regard to the retail trade, most marketing companies in the US and the UK use very accurate information to target niche markets or particular audiences. There is great potential in that area.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bradford has pointed out, there is no point in change for the sake of change. While I have not studied the matter very closely, I assume the Minister of State has a concept of <Col N="661" /> what the new arrangements will achieve. It is not enough to present the new business as a panacea, without specifying what we expect from it. Where does he see it in five years time and what are the expectations on profitability? Will the new enterprise be answerable to the Minister of State on an annual basis? Will there be an annual report to the Oireachtas? </P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed by the OSI staff in Sligo. I had the following letter from a staff member whom I will not name:</P>
    <P>I am writing to you in relation to the Ordnance Survey Ireland Bill, 2001. My union has written to the Minister for Finance, requesting him to consider a number of changes to the Bill. To date, no response has been received to this letter. I set out the concerns of my union to the Bill and I wish to correct some matters that were referred to in the Seanad debate. My union is adamant that provisions must be made in the legislation for worker directors. The union believes the limit of four directors is far too low for any diverse organisation such as the Ordnance Survey Ireland. My own belief is that the upper and lower limits should be increased by three.</P>
    <P>Where the civil service status of OSI staff is being altered by legislation, staff should be given the right to remain with the civil service, either by way of secondment or transfer. My union also believes that the chief boundary surveyor should be brought within the remit of the OSI. It should also be noted that, in the Senate debate, reference was made by a number of speakers to the fact that consultation had taken place with staff and their representatives. This is not the case. In December 1999, the Minister met with unions to announce his intention to alter the status of the OSI. One such meeting was held with officials from his Department, at which the unions outlined their concern, specifically including the requirement for worker directors. The Department cancelled a further meeting planned for March, at 24 hours notice. No explanation or apology was given and no alternative meeting was arranged. No further communication was issued to the union, which forced them to demand a meeting after publication of the Bill. My union believes that adequate consultation has not taken place on this matter. This runs contrary to the partnership model, which appears to be expendable when convenient. Of late, industrial relations in the OSI have deteriorated considerably and staff are now effectively demoralised. In order to improve this difficult climate, it is imperative that a signal is given by statutory provision regarding the worker directors and that staff are guaranteed security of tenure in their jobs in their current locations.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State has already discussed some of these concerns which I have to bring to his attention in relation to the OSI Sligo regional office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> The OSI has a record of 170 years of dedicated service and the latest technology is now available. The Government may privatise for the sake of change, when it suits, but is there a clear benefit? This Bill is to provide for the establishment of a body to be known as the Ordnance Survey Ireland, to define its functions and to provide for connected matters. The Ordnance Survey has done outstanding work on mapping the country. There are advances now in spatial planning and regional development. Huge population changes are taking place in Sligo and elsewhere but I am concerned that they are not correctly documented. We depend greatly on census figures. More use should be made of local offices. Post offices and local postmen are the best source of information on what is happening on the ground, as a basis for documenting change at local level. Population density reflects migration patterns over a long period. There are substantial changes even since the 1996 census. No urban centre has a catchment population of less than 200,000 and nine centres have populations between 200,000 and 400,000. Sligo has a catchment area population of 235,000 and Castlebar has 206,500.</P>
    <P>I called to the Ordnance Survey office in Phoenix Park recently to check out the information on offer on the electronic data system. I asked for the register of Ballymote, on disk, and was given it. I was informed that it was updated and that it was quite accurate. However, when I checked it out, I was astonished to find it incredibly inaccurate. How does this fit in with the concept of added value? We may have the computer technology but is it a matter of &ldquo;garbage in and garbage out&rdquo;? It is essential to get the basic data right. It is outrageous to find that we have inaccurate registers. Even the local electoral register is still based on the very same concept as when it was compiled 40 years ago. It is extraordinary that in this day and age, we cannot list the main earners in a household, the dependants and, where possible, list their telephone number. We are dealing with a system that is outdated. It is outrageous to write to someone on a register who has been deceased for three years. That is the case. We are talking about the Ordnance Survey and the new changes and it is important that a register, when published, is totally accurate and that it is updated. If we are depending on a census of population for an update on population changes, it is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The new Bill outlines many changes. The section I will watch closely sets out the functions to be performed by the body. The functions are: to maintain and develop the underlying physical structure needed to support mapping applications; create and maintain mapping and related geographic data-bases for the entire State; provide mapping and geographic information to both the public and private sectors; and encourage and promote the benefits of the use of its databases and the development of products, services and markets to meet national and user needs. I would <Col N="663" /> like to know what they are. What are we talking about here? We are talking in parables.</P>
    <P>The body's functions are also to advise the Government &ndash; that will be a key function &ndash; or public bodies on policy and practice on mapping and other related matters; represent the State at international level on matters related to mapping and geographic information; provide necessary technical support for the chief boundary surveyor in delimiting and delineating statutory boundaries; depict place names and ancient features as declared in orders made under the Place-Names (Irish Forms) Act, 1973, and to protect the Government copyright on OSI databases, products and published materials, including those made prior to the established date. Copyright is a huge area. How will the copyright legislation safeguard that? It is important if we are talking of freedom of information. If we are opening up the marketplace, it is important that it is developed as well.</P>
    <P>A further OSI function is to conduct its affairs so as to ensure that its revenues are not less than sufficient to meet all proper charges on it. Will we see a huge increase in charges given that we are moving from the protection of the State to private enterprise? Another function is to generate a reasonable portion of its capital needs? How will that be done? A further function is to conduct its business in a cost effective and efficient manner. I agree with that. It is important that we see the role of business in the added value of these services.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the debate in recent days, everything has been fairly well covered. I take this opportunity to compliment the staff in the Ordnance Survey who have worked under difficult circumstances and in difficult times. In recent years we have seen major growth with associated mapping problems, and the staff did a good job under difficult circumstances. The reward they are getting from the State is that they are being taken out of the public sector and put into the private sector. There are areas which can go into the public sector and areas which cannot. We could be making a mistake in regard to the Ordnance Survey and perhaps it should be left in the hands of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always objected to taking responsibilities from the Dáil and to not providing information to it. We have seen this with the National Roads Authority. If one writes to a Minister about the National Roads Authority, the answer is that the Minister has no responsibility and that the matter is now the responsibility of the National Roads Authority. We will have a debate in this House tonight in which we will discuss it. That authority is not answerable to anybody. I went through each constituency recently and could not see that any member of the National Roads Authority was elected to this House. If they were elected, I do not know for what party they stood. They certainly did not stand for my <Col N="664" /> party or for Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party. Maybe there is a party which I have not seen on the backbenches or on front benches of the House but, by God, they seem to have more power than the Minister and the civil servants, and that is wrong. When elected to this House, we are elected to represent all the people and we should not give away our powers.</P>
    <P>Some of the staff have been with the Ordnance Survey for 20 years or more and some have a mine of information. What will happen if some of these people decide they do not want to go into the private sector? Will they be protected by the State? Will their pension rights be protected? Will their future be protected? I know a Bill is to come before the Dáil in relation to that and I hope these people will be rewarded. In the past if those working for Telecom Eireann or other companies had to move two yards down the road or across the road or if they had to implement new work practices, there was a great deal of money involved. Because there is only a small number of people involved in this, they should not be forgotten about. They should be supported and given the respect they deserve. They did a good job in difficult times, some hidden in bunkers because there were not proper facilities for them. I compliment the staff who have done a good job over the years.</P>
    <P>Many Members have mentioned new housing estates. My address used to be Carrowbeg Estate and I had to change it. There was Carrowbeg estate lower and Carrowbeg estate upper and there was a Carrowbeg Estate post office. If a letter came from this House, it would go to Carrowbeg post office which was in Newport, although it was for Carrowbeg Westport. The postman would then have to look for Carrowbeg estate upper and Carrowbeg estate lower. A letter which should have been delivered in two days might not arrive for seven days.</P>

      <P>He had and it was a disadvantage so I changed that. I made sure that situation would not go on. I went back to the old maps and my estate was part of the old Westport House estate and was known as The Paddock. My estate is now called The Paddock, and many people feel that maybe I should be kept in the paddock but I will not be if I can help it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>We went back to the maps and researched it. We now use the address, The Paddock, and our letters come within a couple of days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ordnance Survey should have a part to play in that with the local authorities. When somebody applies to a local authority for planning permission for a housing estate, the local <Col N="665" /> authority should contact these offices and an agreement should be reached there and then. It should be part of the planning condition that the estate be named immediately and that would stop the &ldquo;Dallases&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Glenroes&rdquo; and all these daft names. It would save a great deal of confusion.</P>
    <P>Many postmen have complained to me over the years and they have two complaints. I know we cannot do anything about one of the complaints in the Bill but we can about the other. They have complained about these place names which they do not know. They believe there should be notification from the State, whether the local authority, the Government or otherwise, when planning permission is given for a housing estate, that the post offices should be notified and that somebody there should make a decision on the name of the estate. That is a reasonable request. The Minister cannot do anything about the other complaint that postmen have with regard to letterboxes. The greatest complaint they have is that there are no letter boxes in houses and they are finding it very difficult to deliver letters, whether letters with good or bad news, cheques or bills. It should be a planning condition that there is a letter box in every house. These men and women have a job to do and they find it difficult enough. There should be some way that these agencies can be brought together.</P>
    <P>The Ordnance Survey is being moved into the private sector. If we do that, let us get real and let them have a part to play in the naming of estates. These people have done a good job over the years, particularly when we consider what has happened in this country in the past ten years in terms of development, such as new roads. There is more work for these people and they should get the respect from the State. I hope the Government will protect their rights, including their pensions rights and their Civil Service status because they joined the Civil Service. I listened to Deputy Perry, I read that letter and I spoke to people involved in this. They are upset that nobody has sat down, talked to and listened to them. That is simply because they do not have the numbers of staff that other Departments have. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources would not be privatised without discussing it with the work force and the unions and listening to their point of view. These people have reasonable complaints and worries. We are all afraid of change. We do not like to see the constituency boundaries changed but we have seen that happen over the years, and the Ordnance Survey Office played a part in that as well in terms of mapping the boundary lines. We think about how such changes affect us. We should think about the staff.</P>

      <P>We like them if we are successful and if we are not successful we do not like them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry was right in suggesting that the register of electors should be tied into this. One complaint we all hear again and again at election time relates to the register. The time has come to tie it in with housing estates in terms of planning so that people will be registered. The problem only comes to light when there is an election, when the people say they are not on the register or that the address on the register is not theirs, that it should be Glenroe Road or be Dallas Head or whatever. That is not right. Somebody should decide what name an estate should have. Builders sometimes do not name a development. Local authorities must take some of the blame for that. Naming the development is left to the residents and it can be difficult to get agreement. If there are 25 houses in an estate the residents will give 25 different names.</P>
      <P>The naming of an estate should be tied in with the planning and the register. If we did that we would be doing a good day's work given that some of the names of housing estates are not in keeping with this country or with the area where they are located. The names might sound nice now but down the road, when the fad has passed it will not sound right. As Deputy Perry said, we are supposedly in a new era, and yet we have this situation. We have not moved on and I will give two reasons.</P>
      <P>Thirty years ago a man with a horse and cart went around and opened up drains and we did not have as much flooding on roads as we have now. Nowadays we have engineers and architects to build these new roads. They build them up to the kerb and with the first shower of rain there are floods all over the place. These people are supposed to have further education. They have honours degrees and are better trained than people were in the past, but we have more floods because drainage work is not done. If one asks an engineer now about drainage work he cannot answer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will finish where I started. I do not agree that this should be taken away from the Oireachtas. I do not agree that it should be privatised. I do not agree that any powers should be taken away from this House. Over the past 20 years we have taken too many powers away from this House. We will go before the people very shortly so let me give the Minister some advice. I have been meeting people recently and one message they are giving is that politicians have lost contact with the public. They feel that nobody is listening any more, that Big Brother is watching and that what we have is more a dictatorship than democracy. That is serious and what we need to do now is to return <Col N="667" /> to democracy. I want to be able to put down a Dáil question in relation to whatever mapping must be done and get a reply. If this is privatised, the Minister can say he has no responsibility. There are some Ministers who should not have responsibility and I hope the people will decide that in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which is an important Bill in the context of the Ordnance Survey Office. I reiterate and support what my colleague said with regard to semi-State bodies and the removal of accountability to this House. It removes the opportunity of elected Members of this House to question the decisions of semi-State bodies such as the National Roads Authority which, because of its impact in the area of national primary and secondary road development, is a key body for people who live in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas must look seriously at ways of making semi-State bodies accountable. It is not necessary to throw out the baby with the bath water by having a situation where people in semi-State bodies are not accountable for their actions. Ministers always state that the Houses are responsible for policy, but work carried out by semi-State bodies can have a serious impact on the lives of people. As well as being legislators, we represent people and our ability to obtain information quickly and question the actions of semi-State bodies such the National Roads Authority and now the Ordnance Survey Office is being removed. A method should be devised to reverse that trend and to marry the commercial ethos inherent in the semi-State and commercial sectors with accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Ordnance Survey Office on its work over the years. It is a marvellous organisation and has served the State well. It also served the people well prior to the foundation of State. It was established in 1824, some 177 years ago, long before the Famine, and its work commenced long before Griffith's valuation was carried out. It must have been an enormous task to survey properly the country. The role and influence of the Ordnance Survey Office have expanded dramatically over the years, given its information systems and the need for that information. The work it has done in identifying monuments and other archaeological sites over all of the 177 years must be recognised. Without it we could not have a policy of preserving important historical monuments because before something can be preserved we must know what it is and where it is. The Ordnance Survey Office was one of the first to bring to notice the presence of important archaeological sites. I remember when they were just dots on maps and not of much consequence. However, over the years they became very important to us. That is one important role of the Ordnance Survey Office. Allied to that is its historical role in recording development and historical changes in the landscape. It must have an <Col N="668" /> enormous wealth of information which could be tapped by anybody who wants to trace the development of an area from the changes that have taken place.</P>
    <P>The Ordnance Survey Office also has a role to play in the legal field, an area that we as legislators must deal with on an ongoing basis. In recent years it has been involved in agriculture, an area in which one would never have suspected it would be involved, It is involved in mapping for the purpose of ensuring income for the agricultural community in the context of area aid, extensification, REPs, EU payments. The Ordnance Survey Office now plays a major role and its information is important in facilitating the operation of these schemes which provide major aspects of the income of the farming community. The Ordnance Survey has been involved in the planning process since it was introduced, which was long after the establishment of the Ordnance Survey. It was probably well over 100 years after the foundation of the Ordnance Survey that its role in planning was introduced. Now its information systems are vital to development and planning throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The changes we have seen will probably continue. In the first place, computerisation will radically change the compilation of information. It will also affect the distribution of that information. I hope it will soon be possible for solicitors' offices, planning departments and so forth to dial into the Ordnance Survey and call down maps which they can print in their offices. There should be a way of ensuring that a fee is paid for this service. If one can buy something over the Internet, it should be possible to buy a map from the Ordnance Survey through the same system and pay the necessary fee.</P>
    <P>The staff are the organisation's greatest asset. I congratulate the staff on the work they have done quietly and efficiently down through the years. We have heard about the difficulties experienced by the staff. That is probably inevitable. An organisation which is in existence for 177 years must be afraid of change. In every organisation there is a fear of change. Having been involved in industrial relations for 20 years, I can understand why there cannot be anything other than a fear of change. However, there is a way of managing change and of communicating to people to explain what is happening, what will happen and what the management and the Department are unsure about. Information eases people's concerns. In this case, the personnel are concerned about their future and about promotion.</P>
    <P>Last Monday I met the staff of Aer Lingus in Shannon. One of their biggest concerns was that they were learning about their fate from the press. The most important responsibility of management is to communicate with staff and to inform them about what is happening. I asked the Minister a question today about communicating to the work force the changes that are occurring in Aer Lingus. Her reply was that the union <Col N="669" /> would be kept fully informed. That reply is not good enough. It is the duty of management in an organisation to communicate directly with staff. They are the management's staff, not the trade union's. It is necessary to communicate with the official union but there is a clear responsibility on management to communicate directly with the staff on all aspects of the changes and difficulties that are likely to be experienced.</P>
    <P>The IMPACT survey was most interesting. IMPACT represents almost three quarters of the staff in the Ordnance Survey. The staff were asked if they wished to retain their individual service status. A total of 137 said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and there were two spoilt votes. The overwhelming majority wished to retain their Civil Service status. Have the implications of the changed status been fully communicated to the staff and, if so, why are so many people not happy with the change? I can understand their unhappiness if the situation has not been fully communicated to them because that would be the fear of the unknown. That is human nature.</P>
    <P>They were also asked if they agreed with the decision to change the status of the Ordnance Survey. Twenty seven said they did while 114 answered that they did not. When asked if they had been significantly involved in the change of status programme, 135 out of 144 members said they were not significantly involved. Their concern about the change is directly attributable to their non-involvement in developing the change and the new approach.</P>
    <P>I urge the workers to examine the issue carefully and to embrace change. Change can be positive. I worked in the exposed commercial private sector for many years as an executive. It can be insecure and difficult but it can also be challenging, exciting and provide great opportunities. Things change much faster in the commercial and semi-commercial areas than in the Civil Service. That is probably the result of an historical approach which must change but I will not go into that when discussing this Bill. It is vital that communication take place and understanding be established between those who are involved in introducing the changes and the staff who must accommodate those changes.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation has been mentioned. The Government has a clear policy on decentralisation but it is obviously having difficulties with the policy. Most Members believe decentralisation will not take place before the next general election. I do not know what the situation is but I have lobbied strongly for the decentralisation of a Department to the mid-west, between Newcastle West, Listowel and Kilrush. There could be a substantial movement of staff to those areas with the necessary promotional opportunities. Ease of travel between the three towns would enable a comprehensive decentralisation to the area.</P>
    <P>The issue of naming estates has been raised. I have been concerned about this for some time. I heard an excellent lecture at the Joyce school in <Col N="670" /> Kilfinane, County Limerick, twelve months ago on how we name our estates. We should discuss this subject further. I dispute the Glenroe matter with Deputy Ring because there is an old parish, which dates back to St. Patrick's era or before it, called Glenroe in County Limerick. It is a good old Irish name meaning the red glen or An Gleann Rua. He is right, however, about the manor courts and so forth. I had better not name all of them.</P>
    <P>Limerick County Council opened a new council housing estate in Rathkeale a couple of months ago. It was named Slí na Mílaoise. That is not a traditional name but it is a beautiful one which means &ldquo;the way of the millennium&rdquo;. It was an excellent choice. We should also try to name estates for the townland on which the estate is built. It is a pity to lose the names of our townlands. I presume this information is available in the Ordnance Survey archives.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the value of the archives of the Ordnance Survey. It would be interesting to know the extent of those archives. Many of the place names we are losing are surely preserved for the researchers of the future in the archives of the Ordnance Survey. These archives will present an opportunity in five, ten, 15, 20 or 50 years for people to check place names and rename estates, if they wish to do so. As I said recently to the residents of an estate who were unhappy with the name given to it by the builder, the names of estates are not set in stone. They can be changed by approaching the local authority, if there is agreement within the community to rename them. Estates have been renamed. Many residents who are critical of the names of estates often do not realise it is possible to rename them.</P>
    <P>As this debate develops, there will be much more questioning of the English type names, such as Sherwood Manor, given to estates. There are estates containing the word &ldquo;manor&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; where there is no manor or court. The debate on place names has developed in the past two or three years. There will be an opportunity to check the records of the Ordnance Survey and the Land Registry to identity traditional place names and for estates to be renamed. I am sure many will check those records in the future in the same way as we have re-examined our music and, to some extent, our language. I hope we will do more of this. I am sure we will return to the traditional place names and embrace what was best in them and re-examine their use.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I am glad I had an opportunity to speak on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the comment of my colleague, Deputy O'Flynn, last week that this was not the most interesting of Bills, the number of Deputies who have spoken on it seems to belie that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> The debate on the Bill contained much that was of interest and raised several important issues to which I need to respond and attempt to clarify. Although most Deputies indicated their generous support for the Bill, some questioned the necessity to change the status of the Ordnance Survey from a Civil Service office to that of a State body. In response I can say without any doubt that the change is necessary to ensure a successful future for the OSI. This view was arrived at by the interim board of the OSI, an independent, well balanced body which comprises a wide range of representatives, including employers, trade unions, map sellers and users.</P>
    <P>The need for change ultimately arises from the new technology adopted by the OSI and other national mapping agencies, which has transformed the business of the OSI from simply making paper maps to that of a provider of geographic data in digital form. This technology has resulted in the emergence of the geographic information industry which is faced with meeting ever increasing customer demands for new products and services.</P>
    <P>In the global context, this is an important business with an annual turnover of tens of billions of pounds. As the leading player in the geographic information market in Ireland, the OSI should be well placed to take full advantage of the potential to develop these markets. It cannot do so, however, as long as it remains within the Civil Service. This is not because of any lack of ability or flexibility in civil servants, but because the OSI lacks the statutory framework to enable it to participate fully in the geographic information market.</P>
    <P>Among other matters, the provisions in the Bill are designed to ensure that in relation to purely commercial projects, the OSI will not be open to any serious accusation that it is deriving an unfair advantage over its competitors from its public sector status. In other words, this legislation will enable the OSI to operate as a full player on the same terms in the geographic information market as its competitors.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be surprised to hear that competition is not a hypothetical challenge to the OSI, but a very real part of the everyday environment in which it operates. Despite its leading position and ability to protect its data, this competition is growing all the time. There are no barriers to entry in the geographic information business and, therefore, the OSI must stay at the forefront of mapping technology and continually develop its products and services to enable it to be always in a position to meet the demands of what is a rapidly changing competitive environment.</P>
    <P>If the OSI were to remain within the Civil Service, it would continue to produce high quality mapping for the entire State in the public interest, but its ability to continue to progress and develop and achieve its full commercial potential using its own data would be seriously limited. The OSI would have to watch from the sidelines while its <Col N="672" /> competitors made substantial profits from products and services derived from the data which it had produced. Accordingly, because the Bill will enable the OSI to continue to develop new mapping and geographic services as well as to make these available to meet society's needs, its enactment will not only be in the public interest, it will also be very much in the interests of the OSI staff. The many opportunities emerging in the geographic information market combined with the new freedoms provided for in the Bill point to a bright future for the OSI and its staff.</P>
    <P>One of the most consistent themes in this debate is that throughout the period the Bill was being considered, communication with the staff was inadequate with the result that they are unsure of their future and unhappy with the details of the proposals. Deputy McGrath referred to the results of a questionnaire survey conducted among IMPACT staff in the OSI. On the face of it, the responses show the negative attitude of the staff to any change in the OSI. Having read the questionnaire, however, I can agree with the Deputy's comment about leading questions. I am, therefore, not altogether surprised at the answers. Nevertheless, the questionnaire indicated the existence of a continuing degree of concern by staff about the changes proposed in the Bill. This is an important issue and requires a detailed response from me.</P>
    <P>In February 2000, shortly after the Government decided to draft a Bill providing for the establishment of Ordnance Survey Ireland as a State body, the Minister for Finance and officials of his Department met Ordnance Survey Ireland staff representatives to discuss details of the proposed Bill. Following this meeting technical difficulties arose in the context of the drafting of the Bill which took a long time to resolve. Because there were no substantial developments to report to staff representatives during this period, no meeting with them was arranged. When these issues were settled, however, another meeting was held at official level with Ordnance Survey staff representatives and this took place last March. During the intervening period, however, management in the OSI kept staff representatives at local level informed on a regular basis on the status of the Bill. When it became clear that the technical problems arising in relation to the Ordnance Survey Ireland Bill had been resolved, management in OSI began an information campaign to explain the content of the Bill to staff. OSI management also arranged a series of information seminars at headquarters and in the regional offices to which all staff were invited. This campaign included lunchtime seminars in head office and talks in the regional offices, all of which were well attended. An information circular was sent to all staff in April which was well received. Updates on the progress of the Bill through the Seanad were also sent to all staff. These talks and seminars have continued to date.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to written representations sent to the Minister for Finance by IMPACT earlier <Col N="673" /> in the year, which outlined in detail many of the concerns of staff about the Bill. A formal response to these issues was given by the Minister on 7 June 2001. In his reply the Minister addressed and set out in detail his views on each of the concerns raised by IMPACT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <P>I do not have one. I am replying to the debate and points raised by Deputies. This will be on the record. I have no problem with the Deputy being made aware of any information I am giving. I welcome that he is present and thank him for returning to hear my reply.</P>
      <P>At the end of the letter the Minister expressed the hope that he had provided some reassurance about these concerns and issued an invitation to a meeting at any date with his officials to discuss any outstanding matters. There was no response to an invitation to such a meeting.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above staff meetings, OSI management and trade unions have been meeting as part of departmental council to formally discuss issues arising from the OSI's proposed new status and the related organisational and staffing changes. Following an agreement between OSI management and trade unions a consultant has been engaged to undertake a formal review of industrial relations in the OSI. This work is under way and should lead to an enhanced industrial relations climate in the OSI.</P>
      <P>Staff innovation groups have recently been established in the OSI to consider what skills and work could be developed for the future. In addition, the remit of the groups is to innovate and experiment in relation to product development and explore how to improve processes and systems. These groups, consisting of staff from a number of functional areas throughout the organisation, are being co-ordinated by a group of senior line managers.  In the past week, however, there have been further communications with staff. A preliminary meeting was held with IMPACT staff to discuss an appropriate organisational structure for the OSI after establishment day. It is likely that an independent facilitator will be appointed to help ensure these talks will be successful. The meeting followed the conclusion of initial discussions with officials from the Department of Finance and OSI management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I visited the OSI on Tuesday to familiarise myself with certain matters raised in the House during the Second Stage debate. I conveyed to staff representatives that I understand there are concerns about the proposed changes. I listened to the concerns and reassured staff about my support and that of the Government now and in the future. In response, staff members clearly outlined the main issues of concern to them and summarised how they propose they should be addressed. I dealt with each of the issues in the way I am outlining to the House. I pointed out that some of the more important issues would be <Col N="674" /> faced by OSI staff, even if no change in the status of the office was proposed. I placed a great deal of emphasis on the bright future the Bill promises for the OSI. Based on my experiences with the Office of Public Works, the staff of the OSI will find that they are at least as good as anything in the private sector and possibly better, as a trade union representative pointed out to me.</P>
    <P>I thank all the trade union members whom I met yesterday for their courtesy and the frankness of the exchanges between us. It was a fruitful exercise from my point of view and I hope from that of the staff of the OSI also. I want to thank the director and management of the OSI for facilitating the meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined that the invitation was there, but had not been taken up. When I took charge of this Bill I felt it was necessary and worthwhile for me to do what I have just explained.</P>
      <P>I will now address the main concerns raised by Deputies in the course of the debate and OSI staff representatives yesterday. The staff's main concern centres on the adequacy of the provisions of the Bill to protect their terms of employment. I repeat and re-emphasise that the purpose of section 15 of the Bill is to provide specific statutory guarantees that the terms and conditions of employment of the staff of the new body, including tenure and pay, will not be less favourable than those prevailing immediately before establishment day. There was a great deal of discussion on this matter yesterday. The provisions mean that all members of the staff of the OSI will have a statutory right to stay in their jobs until they reach maximum retirement age. There is no question of the privatisation of the OSI. It should be quite clear to the House, given the structure of the Bill and what I have said, that the Government has taken a particular view of the future of the OSI. Members of staff have been reassured and it was not really an issue in yesterday's discussions.</P>
      <P>In the light of my earlier comments regarding the increasing competitive challenges faced by the OSI, it is relevant to speculate as to the prospects for OSI workers were they to remain within the Civil Service, with limited opportunities to benefit from the data they produce. As I have already said, the Bill offers OSI staff the prospect of a much brighter future. It gives statutory guarantees for the security of employment and superannuation. It also ensures the Exchequer will pay for public interest mapping services. Finally, it enables the OSI to expand and enhance its role, which will enable staff to make an essential contribution to both the development of the geographic information industry and the future development of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> Deputies McGrath and McDowell referred to the possibility of future reductions in the OSI workforce. This concern may relate to the expected completion of the revised rural mapping project about three years from now. My expectation and that of OSI management, however, is that new projects will emerge to replace the rural mapping project. This expectation is based on the fact that, by then, the OSI will have a fully up-to-date set of mapping data, to be used by it as the basis for developing a new range of value added projects.</P>
    <P>Another important issue of concern to OSI staff relates to eligibility for interdepartmental competitions after establishment day. This is of particular concern to the relatively few OSI staff who are in general service grades and consider their career prospects as administrators will be limited if they remain in an organisation focused overwhelmingly on technical production. I do not believe the career prospects for these grades will be as limited in the new OSI as is the case at present. The reorientation of the OSI that will take place as part of its new role will require new structures, which will result in opportunities for staff that do not exist at present. I fully expect that the usual arrangements whereby staff remain eligible to participate in Civil Service competitions after establishment day will also apply in the case of the OSI. I wish to add that negotiations are ongoing between OSI management officials, my Department and OSI staff representatives on this issue.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of eligibility for interdepartmental Civil Service competitions after establishment day, the related issue of the transfer of OSI staff to other areas of the Civil Service was raised. As we know in this House, this is a complex issue for a civil servant who wishes to change either Department or grade stream. In every such case there are difficult hurdles to be jumped before a transfer can take place. The first of these is that there must be a vacancy in the receiving Department, the second is that the management of the Department must be willing to accept the person being transferred and, third, the trade unions involved need to be satisfied that the transfer does not block promotion outlets for existing staff or affect their seniority. We are familiar with the complexity of this issue. An additional hurdle in the case of OSI technical staff is that they would need to be recertified to suitable general service grades. This issue is decided independently by the Civil Service Commissioners. Notwithstanding these constraints, my Department is prepared to discuss options in relation to whatever scope might exist on this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputies McGrath, Brian Lenihan and Joe Higgins asked that the Bill include provision for worker directors. During the course of today's debate, many other Deputies raised the issue again. It was also the subject of discussion with OSI staff yesterday. The reason there is no pro<Col N="676" /> vision in the Bill for a worker director is so we can ensure there will always be flexibility in the configuration of the board. At any given time, the board will have the mixture of talent and experience needed to deal successfully with the challenges it will face. It would not be desirable, therefore, to tie the hands of any future Minister for Finance by putting into legislation a provision that any group or groups will have to be represented on the board of the OSI. There is a trade union representative on the interim board and there is no reason a staff representative could not be appointed to the first or subsequent board of the new body. As we live in an age of partnership, this is a sensible approach. A specific provision was made for trade union representatives on the interim board and I see no reason that cannot continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the legislation for the reasons I have outlined. The Deputy would hold the same view if he was in my position. I do not want to tie the hands of any future Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The workers are an integral part of the OSI and it is very important to them that they be represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that they are an integral part of the OSI and made that clear when speaking to the staff yesterday. The issue will be dealt with in the manner I have outlined to the House. While I cannot, obviously, make a decision on the composition of the first board of the new OSI, any decision in this regard is likely to take account of the importance of staff issues in the transition from Civil Service status to that of a State body. Whether the board contains a worker representative at any given time, I envisage that the staff will be represented in the sub-board structure, such as sub-committees, a number of which have already been established in the context of partnership. Structures will be further strengthened and developed in the future to ensure, as far as possible, OSI management and the board will always be in close touch with the views of OSI staff on important organisational and business issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies raised the possibility that the OSI might be decentralised. This is also a matter of concern to the staff of the body. As I mentioned on 9 October, it is acknowledged that the premises of the OSI in the Phoenix Park are not ideal for a modern mapping organisation. From what I observed yesterday, the spread of the buildings and the configuration of the premises are not suitable. The mapping production process is spread over several separate buildings. I added that the question of the relocation of the OSI's headquarters in the Phoenix Park will be decided in the context of the Government's decentralisation programme. While I cannot pre-empt any <Col N="677" /> Government decision on the matter, it is reasonable to say that in arriving at its decision, the specialised and technical nature of the work carried out by OSI staff, in contrast to the work of most other Civil Service Departments and Offices, will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>As with decentralisation, the future location and status of OSI's regional offices are not matters that arises in the Bill. However, as Deputies and OSI staff have identified this as a matter of concern to them, there is a need to address it. I reiterate that every regional office makes a valuable contribution to the work of OSI in that each carries out all mapping stages in a digital environment, using state of the art equipment. The offices also have specialised tasks, for example, the Tuam office undertakes geo-directory work while the Ennis office looks after aerial photography from nearby Shannon.</P>
    <P>There are no plans or proposals to change the regional office status of any of the Ordnance Survey's regional offices. Rather, there is an ongoing programme throughout all Ordnance Survey regional offices to update technology to ensure that they, along with head office, remain at the leading edge in the provision of mapping. The regional offices make an important contribution to the work of OSI and they will continue to do so after establishment day.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the main issues raised by Deputies and the OSI staff. However, I also wish to refer to the proposals in the Bill to allow OSI to establish subsidiary companies as this subject was raised by Deputy McDowell. Deputy McGrath also referred to this matter. The reason subsidiaries are included in the Bill is to provide a mechanism for the new body to engage in purely commercial activities in a manner that is transparently separate from its public interest functions. The subsidiaries will not take existing work from OSI staff, but instead will be engaged in new projects that, in turn, will underpin and increase the demand for the high quality mapping data which the staff of OSI will continue to produce.</P>
    <P>An important role for OSI which I did not already mention is that of supporting the development of the information society. The information society is an essential element in maintaining Ireland's competitive position and is based on transforming data into information. OSI has the key role of developing the basic data to support the building of a national spatial infrastructure. This was referred to in many different guises by Deputies during the debate. Work is already under way in the Department of the Taoiseach on developing a national spatial strategy. This will be built on OSI data and a draft paper on the requirements for spatial data information in Ireland is being prepared.</P>
    <P>In its new status as a State body, the way OSI does its business will have to change. This will present a challenge for all the staff of OSI. As I said earlier, even if its status remained the same, OSI would still have to face many challenges, but it would be much less able to deal with them with<Col N="678" /> out the proposed changes. These challenges were well summarised recently by the Taoiseach in his address to the euro-geographics general assembly in Dublin when he asked the representatives of the European mapping authorities who were present if they would remain simply mapping providers or if they would become information providers, supporting the framework for international geographical spatial information and infrastructural initiatives.</P>
    <P>In meeting this challenge, OSI can draw on its considerable strengths, not least of which are the professionalism and commitment of its staff. Progress has already been made towards preparing OSI for its new role. The Minister for Finance has, over the past year or so, sanctioned new management posts in all the key areas in the organisation, including human resources, financial management and accounting, corporate services and business management and sales. As a result, work is well under way in these key areas to prepare for the coming age.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton expressed a concern that the Bill would lead to an end to cheap maps. However, computerisation has resulted in the price of large scale maps used in planning and land registering being almost halved. It is already going in the opposite direction. The aim of OSI's policy of establishing agencies is to expand sales and thus reduce unit costs of maps. This is already happening. The service agreement provided in the Bill allows the Minister for Finance to set terms and conditions for the pricing of OSI products. This mechanism, therefore, can be a means of ensuring that users are not overcharged.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton also stated that some areas of the country were not mapped. I was surprised at this statement because my understanding is that there is full coverage of the country within the combined mapping scales.</P>

      <P>I am referring to the current situation. Deputy Noel Ahern was critical of the decision to close the print department of OSI. Management of OSI has been concerned for some time about the efficiency and economic operation of the print department. The matter was examined in detail by a joint management/union sub-committee of a departmental council earlier this year. Although no agreement was reached on the future of the print department, management took a decision, in the overall interests of economy and efficiency, to close it. Substantial investment in new equipment would have been required to continue the operation, with no guarantee of improved efficiencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke expressed concern that OSI's copyright was frequently breached. The Bill provides in section 4(2)(i) that one of OSI's functions is to protect Government copyright on OSI records. Structures have been in place for some time to ensure the enforcement of this copyright. It is envisaged that these structures will be <Col N="679" /> reinforced to ensure that copyright is rigorously protected. There was a major case recently</P>
    <P>where OSI recovered a significant sum &ndash;</P>
    <P>more than £200,000 &ndash; in pursuance of copyright infringements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan said that historical maps are most important in research and he asked where they were located. I am sure the House will be happy to learn that they are deposited in the National Archives. This suggestion was made but it is already the position. All maps that are not needed for day to day work are being transferred to the National Archives.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan also referred to inaccuracies in boundaries. He made the point that they are drawn at various scales. Smaller scales have some inaccuracies while larger scale maps have higher accuracy. However, one cannot compare small and large scale maps because they contain different degrees of information. Large scale maps have much higher accuracy than small scale maps and they cannot be compared. One will get more information in the larger scale map.</P>
    <P>The Deputy said there are only six field workers in the country. This is inaccurate because an average of 25 field workers are working at any given time. The Deputy also said preferential treatment should be given to maps that will be supplied to schools. There are substantial discounts for maps required for first and second level schools. Preferential treatment is also given to third level institutions in the form of making available to them special digital map data sets at minimal cost.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the enactment of this legislation will enable OSI and its staff to achieve its full potential in the geographic information industry as well as provide fundamental support to important areas of economic and social development, thereby making an important contribution to the further improvement of the quality of life for us all. I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate. In particular, I thank the director, management and staff of OSI and my officials in the Department of Finance. I also thank the unions for the courteous meeting we held in recent days which I, and I hope they, found very informative. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Deputies will recall that at the winding up of the Committee Stage debate the chairman of the select committee, Deputy Callely, read into the record the Long Title of the Bill. In light of this intervention, it became clear to me that it was necessary to amend the Long Title of the Bill to reflect the amendment to section 21 on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Section 21 as originally drafted only applies to postal workers. However, the definition was broadened on Committee Stage to apply also to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State; works in the State under a contract of employment; or, where the employment has ceased, entered into a contract of employment referred to in subparagraph (1) or worked in the State under a contract of employment.

      <P>In page 3, line 31, to delete &ldquo;and Terms of Employment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to take on board the fact that the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, as amended, no longer deals with terms of employment and that, therefore, the reference is no longer appropriate. I was unable to attend the Committee Stage debate because of my commitments to the CIE-Esat mini-CTC inquiry and my colleague, Deputy Broughan, kindly took my place. However, the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> Minister of State informed him that &ldquo;it is not legally possible to amend the Title of an Act already in force&rdquo; and advanced this as the reason for not accepting the amendment. He is correct, but the amendment proposes that terms of employment are no longer encompassed by that Act. The amendment would correct the collective citation and not interfere with the Title of the Act in force. There is a distinction.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest this is the most important point in the legislation, but the Minister of State was wrong to put on record on Committee Stage that &ldquo;it is not legally possible to amend the Title of an Act already in force.&rdquo; The amendment seeks to amend the collective citation, not the Title of an Act already in force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that was my position, but my point was that the amendment relates merely to citation. It is not a significant point. I appreciate the Deputy was otherwise engaged in important work when Committee Stage was taken and acknowledge that I said that it is not legally possible to amend the Title of an Act already in force. Section 1(2) merely cites the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act and, together with the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 to 2000, the Bill will improve the position of part-time workers. It is a legal point and my hands are somewhat tied on legal grounds, but I accept the Deputy's point in regard to a layman's interpretation of the wording. I ask him to bear my position in mind in the context of other issues we have discussed and will discuss later. It is not a significant issue on which to have a major difference, but I am tied by legal constraints.</P>

      <P>This is a technical matter about which I do not feel strongly, but I am advised that the amendment would correct an error because there is already a reference to the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1991, in the Social Welfare Act, 1991. Again, the purpose of the amendment is to tidy up this reference. The Minister of State said on Committee Stage it was not necessary. The Chairman was in an awful hurry on Committee Stage and, therefore, the Minister of State never got around to explaining the reason that was so. It is necessary.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 17, after &ldquo;provisions&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;, and in particular an order bringing into operation a provision which gives effect to a provision of the Directive giving effect to the Framework Agreement which may have effect from the date on which the latter provision comes into effect&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment attempts to address in a different fashion the debate on the commencement of the legislation. The issue arises because the principle of direct effect has not been adhered to by the Minister of State. In this case the legislation would be enacted from 20 January 2001. The amendment is another way of trying to provide for retrospective commencement. The Minister of State went to considerable pains on Committee Stage to explain the background as to how the directive was delayed, the reason it was delayed and so on. He said Protocol 14 on social policy constitutes the legal basis for the directive, clearly does not apply to pay and, therefore, by extension to pensions. He also said he sought the advice of the Attorney General's office to that effect. What he eventually resolved on was since pay and pensions are not encompassed by the legislation, but rather by the terms of the negotiations arising out of the PPF, that, therefore, the principle of direct effect is not applicable in this regard. If I understand it, that is the Minister of State's argument in summary. I am trying to allow retrospective commencement for sections of the Bill since the directive was supposed to come into force with effect from 20 January this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> The Irish Congress of Trade Unions takes vehement exception to the Minister of State's position and argues that his position is wrong and that the advice of the Attorney General, if it is correct, means there is no point in negotiating non-discrimination clauses or any other framework agreement which prohibits discrimination in relation to pay and pensions. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions points out that the European Commission was represented at all the meetings and the joint negotiations between the employers and the trade unions which led to this directive. Since that is the case, one would think this aspect would have been raised. I will put on the record one paragraph which probably summarises the position of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Congress refers to the minutes of the Council meeting which adopted the part-time work directive. In those minutes the Commission:</P>
    <P>pointed out that the scope of Article 2(6) of the protocol on social policy excludes remuneration, particularly the determination of salaries, including contributions to supplementary social security schemes. However, the principle of non-discrimination in earnings applied in the same way as a principle covering employment conditions. Indeed the principle of non-discrimination in earnings would most often be covered by Article 119 of the Treaty &ndash; equal pay for men and women.</P>
    <P>I seem to recall on Second or Committee Stage the Minister of State gave figures which show that three quarters of the workforce affected by the Bill are women. Atypical working facilitates many women for a variety of reasons which we will not go into here.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to construct a different type of amendment which would take into account the fact that this directive was supposed to have applied from 20 January this year. It is contended by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that the manner in which the Minister of State proposes to do it has serious implications for this type of directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Rabbitte. Section 2 provides that the Bill will come into operation on a day or days to be prescribed. What date has the Minister of State in mind if it is not 20 January? The retrospective aspect raised by Deputy Rabbitte is important. The Deputy made the point better than I did. There is an anomaly in this area. This matter was discussed on Committee Stage under the chairmanship of Deputy Callely, but was guillotined. The Minister of State indicated he would come back to us on this point. Perhaps he could clarify the reason the opinion given at that time has changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">

      <P>We are dealing with an important subject. I agree with Deputies that this is important legislation and thank them for facilitating its relatively speedy passage through Commit<Col N="684" /> tee Stage. There has been much discussion on this issue. I will recall the Government's position on the points raised by Deputies Rabbitte and Perry.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will recall that the issue of remuneration and pensions was discussed on Second and Committee Stages. I outlined on Committee Stage that following representations from the ICTU I had the issue examined in detail by the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. The Government amendment to section 3, which was approved on Committee Stage, clarified for avoidance of doubt that the terms and conditions of employment included pension schemes. That was an important amendment and it met the ICTU's genuine concerns in that regard. However, the amendment now proposed by Deputies Broughan and Rabbitte attempts to backdate entitlements under the Bill to 20 January 2001, the date the directive was due to come into effect, particularly in relation to pay and pensions.</P>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, during discussions with the Department's legal advisers the question as to the propriety of interpreting the directive as covering remuneration and pensions arose. A view emerged that Protocol 14 on social policy, to which the Deputy referred, which is annexed to the treaty establishing the European Union and which constitutes the legal basis of the directive, is clearly expressed as not applying to pay and, by extension, to pensions. Accordingly, the Department sought from the Office of the Attorney General a formal legal opinion on the matter. A response from that office was recently received to the effect that in its view the wording of Protocol 14 precludes the application of the part-time work directive to remuneration and pensions. Accordingly, while the Bill applies to remuneration and pensions, it does so because of the Government's commitment to this effect, as Deputy Rabbitte acknowledged, in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, not as a requirement of the directive. The important implication of this advice is that as regards remuneration and pensions, any benefits accruing to part-time employees arising from the enactment of the Bill will apply from a future date only. That is the legal position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As someone who has had ministerial responsibility, Deputy Rabbitte knows there is a huge constitutional difficulty with retrospective legislation. Backdating will not arise in these areas in respect of the period since 20 January last when the directive was due for transposition into Irish law. I accept the Deputy's right to question this issue now. In the light of this legal advice I do not propose to accept the amendment. I accept the right of Deputies to raise the issue. I am conscious that many part-time workers are watching this debate closely. Deputy Rabbitte mentioned some part-time workers, but there are others in the teaching area, for example, who are anxious to see the legislation passed. We have had discussions with the Department of Education and Science which is monitoring developments in <Col N="685" /> relation to the passage of this Bill in so far as they may affect the terms and conditions of teachers' employment and issues relating to conditions which, as Deputies will appreciate, are normally dealt with through the teachers' conciliation council which is chaired by the Department of Education and Science and meets on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State, it is my responsibility to steer this legislation through the Houses as quickly as possible. If there are issues to be dealt with by other Departments and Ministers, they will be dealt with in a different environment. It is important for me to spell out the legal position as we see it. The Deputy mentioned the Council meeting in 1997. Our legal advisers would have taken the points the Deputy made into account when deciding their position. We have gone as far as possible under our legal authority, particularly in terms of commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. There is a constitutional problem with retrospective legislation. There may be other fora in which certain part-time workers will be able to deal with their cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat unsatisfactory, to put it mildly, because the Minister of State is right that many part-time workers or their trade unions are watching this Bill progress through the House. The prospect of it becoming law has been held out to them for a long time. I do not want to reiterate the reasons we initially sought a derogation for one year, but having obtained it we did not manage to make that deadline. Now we are almost on our way to one year after the derogation and the phenomenon of atypical working and part-time working is growing all the time. We find ourselves confronted with the Minister of State who says his hands are tied by the advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that, for different reasons, the legislation cannot be made to have retrospective effect. That will be a source of considerable disappointment to many workers who thought that the Bill might have become law last year, certainly not later than 20 January this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides for the removal of discrimination against part-time workers. I am amazed that there is such difficulty with making legislation retrospective due to the fact that so much legislation is being introduced. Certain retrospective legislation has benefited aspects of development in the State. I am disappointed that there is such a difficulty and wonder why it has arisen concerning retrospective legislation. That question should be clearly answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte mentioned the 12 month derogation. Clearly, the Bill was aimed at facilitating the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis and contributing to the flexibility and organisation of working time in a manner which takes into account the needs of employers and workers. If they are obliged to do so, employers will make retrospective payments. I am dismayed <Col N="686" /> that in some cases the Government cannot bring in retrospective legislation that would provide entitlements for part-time workers. In some cases legislation can be referred back to the Attorney General for his opinion as to whether it is unworkable, but does anybody question his opinion? Is he the &ldquo;almighty&rdquo; on this matter? Is his word final on all legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the delays, I published the legislation in December 2000. The history of the Bill will show that much consultation took place, but I am not in the blaming game. The delays were not caused by any want of trying, on my part, to bring the Bill to the House, but by the introduction of other legislation, including the Carer's Leave Bill. Much good legislation has gone through the House in recent times.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 46, after &ldquo;including&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;a member of the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a relatively straightforward amendment which relates to the definition section interpretations. It seeks to have expressly included in the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo;&ldquo;a member of the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána.&rdquo; As it stands, and given the normal interpretation put on these matters in labour legislation during the years, it requires that it be explicitly given expression in the legislation that members of the Garda Síochána or Defence Forces would be included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Garda Síochána and Defence Forces are included under the provisions of the Bill as drafted. Neither class nor category is explicitly mentioned in the text as being excluded, which implies that they are covered by the provisions of the Bill. Deputies will recall that on 3 October, on Committee Stage, I moved a Government amendment to provide that while members of the Defence Forces are covered in the Bill, in cases of dispute such members should have recourse to their own redress procedures as provided for under the Defence Acts, rather than to the rights commissioner service. This amendment was sought by the Department of Defence. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on the other hand, did not specifically express any concerns regarding the inclusion of the Garda Síochána within the remit of the Bill. This is in line with <Col N="687" /> the approach previously adopted in the Parental Leave Act and the Carer's Leave Act. This amendment, which is now incorporated in the new text of the Bill, should clarify the matter for Deputies. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 5 which is unnecessary.</P>

      <P>Before I come to amendment No. 7, may I ask a question? The record of the debate on Committee Stage seems to show that the Minister of State said he would come back on the definition of &ldquo;remuneration.&rdquo;  An issue arises relating to access to any pension scheme or the arrangements governing the payment of employers' contributions, where applicable. Section 3(1) refers to &ldquo;any amounts the employee will be entitled to receive on foot of any pension scheme or arrangement.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4) In the case of a part-time employee placed by a temporary work agency at the disposition of a user enterprise, the comparator worker shall be a comparable full-time employee in the user enterprise.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the single largest outstanding defect in the Bill and has not been addressed. My amendment seeks to deal with the prevalent phenomenon whereby agency workers are effectively precluded from the terms of the legislation. This relates to the comparator that may be used in terms of the eligibility of workers encompassed by the Bill. The comparator is not the enterprise or employment in which the agency worker is actually working, but rather another agency worker. Let me give an example. Let us suppose Ryanair wanted to employ a baggage handler from an agency, that baggage handler may not have his or <Col N="688" /> her conditions of employment assessed by reference to other baggage handlers on the job, but only by reference to another agency worker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and understand the spirit behind it. It raises a number of interesting and appalling contradictions regarding the Government's proposals for the western counties.</P>
      <P>The motion calls for a co-ordination of ministerial responsibilities in order that services can be delivered. There has been a significant increase in the level of disadvantage facing these counties. In the 1970s I wrote a policy paper for the Labour Party on western development in which I pointed out the kind of issues to which this motion refers, namely, access, infrastructure, communications and energy.</P>
      <P>The agriculture sector in the west has always differed from the regional characteristics in other areas such as the south. For example. agriculture in the west faced physical difficulties due to drainage, the nature of holdings, soil quality and so on. These issues have been addressed by reports going back to that produced by Dr. Scully. Holdings in the west were fragmented and small. Up to 70% of them were under 50 acres and 50% were under 30 acres, making it impossible to achieve economies of scale in response to price driven policies in agriculture. Agriculture in the west has always suffered from the priority given to the guarantee side concerning different European programmes, rather than the guidance side which would have given greater priority to farm families.</P>
      <P>As regards the issues raised in the motion, it is extraordinary that an access route such as the section of the N5 from Ballaghdereen to Strokestown would be neglected. Deputy Kenny correctly drew attention to this fact when moving the motion. This illustrates some appalling contradictions, some of which I will list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To anyone interested in regional development and regional and national spatial planning it seemed an extraordinary decision to publish the national development plan with explicit allocations for massive road building preojects and then invite submissions to the national spatial plan. That plan came after the massive capital allocations announced in the national develop<Col N="691" /> ment plan. Put simply, this was a clear case of putting the cart before the horse.</P>
    <P>However, more was involved. There was an absence of consultation regarding the planned, co-ordinated approach in delivering and responding to the needs of the west. We have been through much of this before when we were involved in the farce which was called the preparation of a regional submission to the European Union. This process did not comply with any known principles of regional planning.</P>
    <P>In a recent paper, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív, made the same analysis which I made in the 1970s by taking age cohorts, comparing them in inter-census periods and identifying the movement of people from DEDs in rural areas. It is true that cities have drained populations from towns, and towns have drained them from villages. However, there is no indication that the Government is interested in setting up proper consultation procedures on the ground.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív's colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, was referred to in Deputy Kenny's speech on this motion as suggesting that the NRA is an independent body. Deputy Kenny pointed out that, when he put a question to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, he received the following answer:</P>
    <P>The Roads Act, 1993, assigns overall responsibility to the National Roads Authority (NRA) for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads. Section 41 of the Roads Act, 1993, confers power on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to give a direction in writing to the NRA in relation to any of the functions assigned to it. The NRA must comply with any such direction. To date, no directions have issued to the NRA under this provision.</P>
    <P>The widest possible confusion has been deliberately sown by representatives of the Government and its parties going to public meetings and washing their hands of any responsibility. They are suggesting that the NRA is an independent body and that Ministers have no responsibility in these areas. At the same time they cart in individuals affected by the NRA's proposals and arrange individual consultations with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny also referred to the Taoiseach's speech at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis in which he suggested that he intends that we will have roads similar in status to those in Germany. Who decided that constructing an <i>autobahn</i> heading for Connemara was the most appropriate way to deal with the transport needs of the people of Connemara, Galway or Galway city? The people <Col N="692" /> of Galway did not so decide. Not only was an allocation made in the national development plan ahead of any serious spatial planning, but the spatial planning consultation process began after the large sums were allocated. There was no consultation regarding the appropriate transport needs. This led to the neglect of the corridors which people needed through, for example, Roscommon.</P>
    <P>In addition, this approach gave no opportunity to those who wished to have their transport needs defined. The Government did not listen to the different options which might be available to resolve the difficulties. This is true of almost every aspect of life in the west. There is no commitment to a clear policy or any semblance of co-ordination.</P>
    <P>There have been other weasel statements. For example, Senator Cox suggested publicly that people in rural Ireland need not fear the closure of rural post offices, even though they are being lost at the rate of two or three per week. The decision was that they would not be deliberately closed, but would be allowed to wither on the vine while the services allocated to upgrade them and make them viable are not provided. At the same time other PostPoint facilities have been developed in supermarkets. This is scandalous and an example of all the bluster we are getting.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, who criticised the Labour Party's spatial policy, has been suggesting that the building of houses in rural areas is, more or less, a free for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State says whatever suits. What of his attitude to the Department for which I had responsibility regarding the environment, conservation and planning? If he wanted to save the west and have a consultation process as regards people's needs in a planned and co-ordinated way, he would not be forcing them to choose between environmental and development concerns. He would have been able to say, for example, that work would be carried out on facilities which could have been upgraded and made safe in an environmentally responsible manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this is no more than the other bogus nonsense which has been passed around about special areas of conservation and directives on habitats and birds, some of which I signed in 1997, all of which were negotiated in 1992. The Government of the day, which is the same as the current Government, had an opportunity to change anything it wished to in those directives, <Col N="693" /> but did not do so. It then did the cowardly thing and went through the back door trying to whip up resentment against that which it made possible and for which it was responsible for negotiating in Brussels.</P>
    <P>What we have seen is a shambles of deceit and an absence of consultation. It is no wonder that people in cities, towns, villages and rural areas highlight the fact that their problems are known through one report after another, but ask the reason they did not get a chance to outline what they wanted and the reason they were excluded in a grand scheme driven by the investment of money, much of it sourced abroad, to build <i>autobahns</i> when what they wanted were upgraded roads which would facilitate development in the ways they wished to discuss. This is the kind of arrogant, authoritarian approach we have had.</P>
    <P>That is why this motion is an example of the sham the Government has visited on the west. We will get long and convoluted theological speeches about this, that and the other. The answer is simple. What county has announced all its spending in advance of a plan and then invited its people to take part in a spatial planning strategy? All the money has been allocated. What kind of nonsense is that?</P>

      <P>Major developments on a scale not experienced before are taking place throughout the country under the national development plan. However, the Government has the integrity and the honesty to recognise, that not withstanding the unprecedented amount of investment, there are certain areas in the country both urban and rural that require special attention and priority under the plan. It was for this reason it was agreed with the social partners to initiate the RAPID programme. This is already up and running in the urban areas and provincial towns are being selected at present by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It was also agreed with the social partners that there would be a rural version of RAPID. As somebody who has worked and lived in a rural area for a long time, I made the case very strongly that rural areas required rural solutions to rural problems and not urban solutions to rural problems. Therefore, both the criteria for selecting the rural areas and the methodology for the programme should and does differ radically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk in recent years about rural development and now is the time for action. In seeking to deal with this problem the Government is using a number of instruments. The first is the use of rural proofing. Draft rural proofing guidelines have recently been noted by Government and the process is continuing to put these into operation. The second method is to select depopulated areas under the <Col N="695" /> Clár initiative &ndash; rural RAPID &ndash; and to ensure that these areas get priority in the expenditure under the national development plan. One of the big mistakes when rural problems are talked about is that we lump all of the west together. The problems of Galway city are more like the problems of any major growing urban area. They are very different to the problems of Leitrim, which Deputy Reynolds represents, or parts of Mayo that Deputy Ring represents or parts of Connemara that I represent. In this initiative we have picked all parts of the country, irrespective of geographical location, that are similar in terms of depopulation. This is a much better way of doing business.</P>
    <P>No specific sum has been put on this re-prioritisation of development under the NDP. This cannot be done until the shortfall in social community and economic structure in the areas are identified and costings are put on the amount of money required to ensure that these areas fully benefit from the plan in the years 2002-2006. The £20 million &ndash; which some Deputies foolishly think is the sum total of the initiative &ndash; is a small additional element of the Clár initiative. This has been put there for the specific purpose of ensuring that matters of grave and urgent importance in these areas can be addressed even if they fall outside the direct remit of the NDP. In this way and through the structures that have been put in place &ndash; including the use of the County Development Boards, the interdepartmental committee and the Cabinet subcommittee &ndash; there is a comprehensive plan to ensure that this initiative will make a real difference.</P>
    <P>I also point out to the Deputies that the areas were selected on objective criteria and that the analysis of the data and the preparation of the maps were carried out by the geography department of NUI Maynooth. I thank it for its assistance in doing that.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for me to conclude without directly referring to the outrageous statements made by Deputy Ulick Burke last night. I must presume that Deputy Burke, in the excitement of the moment had a rush of blood to his head when he was speaking. On that basis I forgive him. However, in view of the very serious statements he made, I have to set the record straight. Deputy Burke referred to the use of &ldquo;slush funds with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, as his [Éamon Ó Cuív's] own personal slush fund in order to improve his own constituency&rdquo;. There has been a budget heading under Gaeltacht improvement schemes available to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, for as long as I can remember. This very admirable scheme has been used by all Ministers to ensure the serious deficiencies in social, community and physical infrastructure in the Gaeltacht was addressed. I continued this work, albeit <Col N="696" /> with much greater funding, due to the recognition by the Government and the Minister for Finance of the huge deficiencies in Gaeltacht infrastructure. In relation to the funding I had for the islands, it was Deputy Burke's colleague, Deputy Donal Carey, who initially persuaded his Taoiseach to give a small dedicated fund for island development. I have many times complimented him on this achievement. I developed this programme dramatically and managed to increase the funding five-fold during my tenure of office in that Department.</P>
    <P>There is a criticism by Deputy Burke, that I used this money as a personal slush fund in my constituency. Nothing could be further from the truth. I will stand on my record as having spent the money available to me in a fair manner between all Gaeltachtaí and islands. I draw Deputy Burke's attention to a statement made by Deputy McGinley at an Estimates meeting when he complimented me on the fair way I had distributed funds during my tenure of office in that Department. I have no doubt that the other Deputies who represent Gaeltacht and island areas from Deputy Burke's party will testify to the fair manner in which I dealt with each area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy did not. He said I was using this as a slush fund. Check the record. I now call on Deputy Burke to withdraw this serious remark.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke also accuses me of manipulating Clár to have a &ldquo;special emphasis on his own constituency area in the Gaeltacht of Connemara&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It will not. The population decline in this area did not warrant their inclusion. The area included stretches across from Turloch, Rosmuc, northwest to the county border with Mayo and west to the sea, taking in the mainly non-Gaeltacht section of west Connemara, an area of decline and very poor infrastructure. This in total comprises 27 DEDs. In the Deputy's constituency of east Galway, the programme also includes 19 DEDs in the north of the county and 11 in the south of the county total<Col N="697" /> ling 29 DEDs. Is the Deputy telling me that both of these areas in his own constituency are not in urgent need of special attention in view of the dramatic decline in population, and could he not have had the good grace to acknowledge that the special needs of these neglected areas have now been recognised?</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke has labelled me &ldquo;rebellious&rdquo;. If being outspoken, committed and hardworking in the interests of rural Ireland and my brief is being rebellious, I take it as a compliment.</P>

They are aware the Cabinet sub-committee is examining the area of infrastructure with particular emphasis on the N5 and held a meeting with the NRA on the subject in July. Fine Gael is afraid it will be left behind when more money is invested in the road. This Government will finally get the credit for what it is doing. I could continue for much longer. Regrettably, I do not have much time, but judging by the noise on the opposition benches, I am obviously hitting a raw nerve.</P>

      <P>I ask Deputy Burke to keep quiet for a second because I want to clarify something. When we talk about the west we normally talk about counties Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Leitrim and Sligo. What puzzles me is that counties Sligo and Leitrim are never mentioned. I suppose there is a very good reason for this. Perhaps County Mayo did not receive its share of the cake in recent times. As far as counties Sligo and Leitrim are concerned, we have been reasonably successful with regard to infrastructural projects under the Government.</P>
      <P>The Dublin to Sligo railway line is now within three miles of completion with an all-welded line. That is progress as far as the Government is concerned. I remember during the lifetime of the last Government the then Minister, Deputy Yates, told us that the future for the Dublin-Sligo line was extremely bleak, that it was unlikely that any money would be spent on it. I am delighted that money has been spent on it because it gives people the opportunity to avail of a rail service and that there will be further upgrading of carriages and rolling stock.</P>

      <P>The gas pipeline will be of major benefit and I hope the people objecting to this and other developments right across the west, who have little or no interest in it, take a long, hard look and decide that the west is entitled to be developed and not turned into a nature park or reserve, as some would like to see happen. The objections to planning or development projects in the west are not coming from the people of the west, but from blow-ins or people not living there or not directly involved.</P>
      <P>My colleagues, Deputies Ring and Gerry Reynolds, will also agree that people are now interfering to prevent the development of the west, something which must be tackled. We must ensure infrastructural projects are not interfered with and not held up. We need that infrastructure; we need the gas pipeline&mdash;</P>

I was delighted to be there last Sunday week when the Fianna Fáil brigade hijacked the occasion and neither Deputy Kenny nor I were invited to the platform. We delivered and we took them on.</P>
      <P>I remind my western colleagues of the song &ldquo;We're on the one road&rdquo;. Tonight, we are on the N5 &ndash; the road which links Dublin to Westport. If the Ministers of State, Deputies Moffatt and Ó Cuív, are with us, they will go to the right in tonight's vote and if they are against us, they will go to the left.

All west of Ireland Deputies have an opportunity tonight to send a message to the National Roads Authority, the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who, like bin Laden, is missing. He should be here to defend his policy. We want a proper road and the Minister should direct the NRA to make that a priority.

      <P>I join in supporting the motion. The N5, from Longford to Mayo, is an important traffic artery. Major developments on the N5 were originally scheduled for 2015. Consultants were recently appointed to examine the prospect of a Longford bypass, which is a vital necessity to <Col N="708" /> alleviate the pressure of heavy traffic in Longford town. No county town should be subjected to that situation. Following the appointment of the consultants, a public meeting was held and there was much speculation about the route of the bypass. It now appears that it was all pie in the sky &ndash; that there was no substance to it. I want to hear from the Minister, in this House, as to whether the Longford bypass is a figment of imagination or a fact. That is what the people of Longford want to know. Knowing the reputation of this Government for shadow rather than substance, I hope the Longford bypass is not one of the shadows. As Deputy Ring said, £150 million of taxpayers' money has been spent on public relations companies to spin the shadow that this is a great Government.  That is what we hear morning, noon and night. On top of that, 75 spin doctors are employed morning, noon and night to say that this is a great Government, that there is no Opposition and that the people must elect this Government again. I am afraid the flip side of the coin is now showing the real truth. The Government is in crisis. It does not know whether it is coming or going &ndash; it is all over the shop.</P>

      <P>I support my colleagues and this motion, particularly because I spent some time going along this road during my three years as Minister with responsibility for the west. The problem I had with this road was that it was very dangerous. It is so dangerous that it is one hazard after another. No matter what money has been spent in any other part of Ireland, including Mayo, I do not know that it is good enough for any member of the Government party to say that road is up to acceptable standards. It is a dangerous thoroughfare. As Deputy Belton said, drivers also experience unnecessary delays and this causes frustration.</P>
      <P>All of that is because of a lack of planning by the National Roads Authority. The lack of planning is biased against the west. It is biased because of the guidelines it receives with money from the Department of the Environment and Local Government and EU funds. In my constituency, two major works are proceeding and both stretches of road are of equal distance. Works on one stretch have been going on for three or four years while the other works started recently yet the same amount of work has been completed on both.</P>
      <P>I live at the top of the road in Clarecastle and we are swamped with cars. Drivers experience a three mile tailback at Newmarket-on-Fergus but now it appears that problem is being transferred to my village. No contingency plans have been prepared and no effort has been made to develop the side roads. All the minor roads belonging to Clare County Council will sink without a trace.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority will wash its hands of all these difficulties. Alternative routes are being chosen by people and, by and large, the county roads are suffering terribly. The big problem is that the Department of the Environment and Local Government has no interest in what the National Roads Authority is doing. It is adopting a hands-off approach. Like Pontius Pilate, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has washed his hands of this matter.</P>

Judging by his attitude to county councillors, they are not too happy with him either.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to visit my constituency and my village of Clarecastle and explain to the people whose businesses have been wiped out what will happen when these two stretches of primary road from Ballycasey to Latoon Cross are complete. The National Roads Authority will say the priority is the eastern corridor and that it has to develop this dual carriageway from Belfast to Rosslare. No matter what one does or says about the</P>
      <P>west, it is ignored because it does not have the population and everybody is running to Dublin. I do not know how many other negatives there are in regard to us. What I find most appalling is that western Deputies accept this negativity. Those voting against this motion are saying they are happy with a Fianna Fáil Minister who will not give priority to a dangerous road. Death and danger stalks the N5 and the Government is doing nothing about it.</P>

      <P>I am delighted with the opportunity to speak on this most important matter &ndash; the development of the west. Fianna Fáil is good at one thing &ndash; whether in or out of Government, it will always give the impression that nobody can handle western development like it can. That has happened down through the years. I would like to nail that lie. No matter what I say it will be seen as political point scoring because we are in a political Chamber. The Government will ask, &ldquo;what else would the Opposition say?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the State of the West report released by the Western Development Commission on 24 July last &ndash; not three months ago. The report shows that despite some growth, most of the western region still lags behind the rest of the country and that the gap is widening, and that is even with the national development plan. The report stated that unless Government acts now to address the infrastructural divide, a technical and communications gap will develop which will be impossible to bridge. It stated that this situation is sufficiently serious to warrant radical and dramatic action. The report reveals that apart from Galway city and a few areas in County Clare, the west is attracting a tiny share of inward investment while most of its industrial base is weak and vulnerable. So much for western development.</P>

Now what is important is that this report is given by an independent body set up by Government but not fettered by it. In other words it is an honest broker. If the Western Development Commission says we are not doing well in the west, we are not doing well. It is on the record for everybody to see. It is nothing short of a disaster that the N5 is not included in the development planning at this stage.</P>
      <P>One need go no further than Ballinasloe to see that the plan is not working for the west, despite all the talk from the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and rural Development, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Recourses, Deputy Fahey. Ballinasloe is a good solid town, close enough to Dublin. It did not get a single job in the past four or five years and lost the A. T. Cross factory in the meantime. What will the people of Ballinasloe think after five of the best years this economy has ever seen? They did not get anything. What will they get in the next five years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support my colleagues from the west and on this side of the House. They have touched a raw nerve on the Government side, judging by the response, and they have uncovered a major flaw in the Western Development Plan.</P>
      <P>The basis of my credibility, if I have to establish it here &ndash; and it appears from the Government side of the House that one must establish the basis of one's credibility if one wishes to speak on this issue &ndash; is that my county is a member of the BMW authority. That is not a motor car. It is the Border, Midland and Western Region authority. I am the sole Oireachtas Member on that authority representing my county of which I am very proud, and the Minister who bears responsibility for the amazing shortfall in the plan in the context of raising the N5, is the Minister who would try to ban me from exercising a dual mandate which enables me to put on record in this House the fears of the BMW authority about this plan for the west.</P>
      <P>Because I travel to regular monthly meetings of the BMW authority, which are held in Roscommon, I am fully aware of the condition of the N5. It is simply appalling. From the Longford-Cavan border to Roscommon it is a dangerous road. It concerns me because much of the traffic to the west from the Cavan-Monaghan region and from Louth travels the N5 and it is certainly a nightmare. It would be extremely costly upgrade it and that may be the reason it was omitted. There seems to be money available for every other region in the country, but because the terrain that takes this section of the N5 is of a boggy nature it was simply omitted. Why not just build a wall across it and close it off altogether? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another serious omission has not been mentioned yet. That is the east-west corridor. The Sligo-Leitrim, Cavan-Monaghan, Louth roadway which was mentioned in the development plan five years ago has been omitted and taken off the map. No such road is mentioned, again because of the cost factor. The west will be isolated from the east and interaction between the two parts of the country will be prevented because of the actions of this Government. I am appalled that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government did not see fit to come into the Chamber. I would like to know why he did not. If the N3 from Dunshaughlin to Meath were closed off, not only would the Minister be here but he would raise hell with the NRA and demand that that section of the road be <Col N="713" /> developed so that he could get home in comfort. It appears that the west does not matter to the Minister. The south and the midlands seem to be the important networks. That is not good enough and it is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, spoke about the great development that has been achieved and he gave some statistics. I will put one on the record. It is the most recent unemployment statistic which shows that the BMW region has the highest unemployment in the country. I defy anyone to contradict it. How can we attract industry, create job opportunities and develop tourism if we do not have the infrastructure? The role of Government is to put that in place. We have people in those regions who have the will and the capability to deliver. They are as good as anywhere else in the country, but they must have services, the provision of which is the State's responsibility. The Minister has neglected his responsibilities. He is obviously begging from higher forces in his own party if he cannot deliver on this issue. The Minister from the west and the junior Minister must take responsibility. I congratulate my colleagues on raising the issue. In doing so they have done a good day's work for the people of the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support my colleagues from the west and north-west. We all know the importance of access for industrial and other development. The Government claims it has created over 300,000 jobs here in the past five years. However, it is significant that most of these jobs have been created outside of the west and north-west, which covers Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. A record has been created there in that in every year since 1996-97 there has been a net decrease in the number of IDA-sponsored jobs in the north-west and that it is primarily owing to lack of adequate access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with everything that was said about the N5 and the N3. However, I wish to mention the N2. The national development plan provides that the roads from Dublin to Belfast, from Dublin to Cork, from Dublin to Limerick, and from Dublin to Galway, will be raised to the status of a dual carriageway or a motorway during that plan. However, the N5, the N3 and the N2, with which I am very familiar, will just be improved here and there. When I leave Dublin to travel north along the N2 there is usually a tailback from Ashbourne into Dublin. Once one gets on to the straight after Ashbourne the next obstacle is in Slane. There is a beautiful bridge there, one of the finest and most picturesque in the country, but it is unbelievable that the main thoroughfare to the north-west allows only for one-way traffic so that one often has to sit for five, ten or 12 minutes before one can cross that important bridge and make one's way to the Border. The N2 and the A5, which is a continuation of the N2 in Northern <Col N="714" /> Ireland, is a primary road and there should be a joint approach between the Northern Ireland authorities and our own authorities to raise the standard of that road.</P>
    <P>Donegal is one of the most peripheral counties in Ireland and it has a regional airport. From Kerry Regional Airport to Dublin there are four return flights a day. From Galway there are five. From Sligo there are two or three. From Donegal International Airport, the furthest away from Dublin, there is not a single return flight a day. A person travelling to Dublin can return home only the next day. That is useless to the business community and to businessmen who want to create jobs in Donegal and the north-west.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Corrib gas field, current Government policy seems to be to find the quickest way of taking the gas out of the west. I understand there is a proposal to bring it as far as Sligo. Then there is a quick right turn into Northern Ireland. As far as Donegal is concerned it will get nothing from natural gas. There might be a spur into Letterkenny but otherwise the county will be without that vital source of energy. I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, mentioned his Clár programme and quoted me earlier. The programme he announced involves £2 million for 55 centres in Donegal over a two year period. This means every centre will get £18,000 per year for two years. That is not enough to build half a mile of the bóthar áise which the Minister was so busy doing when he was in his last Department.</P>
    <P>The west and north west, particularly Donegal, do not figure in the Government's policies. There are six Deputies from Donegal, five of whom support the Government. They will support the Government tonight in spite of how the county has been ignored, leaving it with the highest unemployment rate in the country at almost 20%.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it took office, the Government has prioritised the upgrading of our infrastructure and the achievement of more balanced regional development. It has pursued these objectives through: massively increased investment in infrastructure &ndash; investment in national roads, for example, has increased from £260 million in 1997 to £620 million in 2001, an increase of 138%; a comprehensive national development plan which provides the strategic framework and the funding for continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth throughout the country; the development of a national spatial strategy to provide an overall development agenda and a national and regional context for future decision making on investment in infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone have we a clear view of what we wish to do but we have put in place the policies and the funding to achieve it. The Cabinet committee <Col N="715" /> on infrastructure, which is chaired by the Taoiseach, has overseen the implementation of a range of measures to address institutional, legal and administrative obstacles to, and capacity constraints on, the implementation of key infrastructural projects under the national development plan. There is a clear focus on timely and efficient delivery of infrastructure throughout the country, including in the western counties. The committee has considered, in particular, the infrastructural needs of the western counties not only in the area of roads but also in the energy and telecommunications sectors.</P>
    <P>Data compiled for my Department by the various implementing agencies clearly indicate that many of the projects provided for in the NDP are already under way or even completed. In 2000, investment in national roads, public transport, water services, energy, social housing and health facilities in the BMW region amounted to just under 630 million, which was largely in line with the targeted expenditure for the year. I am confident that this strong progress will be continued into the future. Naturally, given the scale of the infrastructural programme under way, many of the projects are in various stages of the statutory planning and public consultation process that must be completed in all cases. It is simply unreasonable for the Fine Gael Deputies to expect that all of these projects should already be completed or under way.</P>
    <P>The Ministers of State, Deputies Molloy and Jacob, outlined last night what has been done and what is in the pipeline in transport, energy and telecommunications. However, the message bears repeating. Regardless of whether the Opposition wishes to acknowledge it &ndash; and it clearly does not &ndash; the Government has invested heavily in the infrastructure of the western counties and is continuing to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Look more closely at the position in relation to the roads network. It provides clear evidence of the Government's commitment to improving the infrastructure of the western counties. Investment in counties Clare, Galway, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Sligo and Roscommon, for example, has increased over the period 1997 to 2001 by 151% on national roads from £43 million to £108 million in 2001 and by 58% on non-national roads from £52 million to £82 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been achieved and is being achieved with this investment. The House will be aware of the many projects in the western counties that have been completed recently or are under way. They include the Donegal bypass, Clar/Barnesmore, Mountcharles bypass, Cavan bypass, Curlews bypass, Collooney/Sligo, <Col N="716" /> Knock/Claremorris, Sligo inner relief road, Newmarket-on-Fergus bypass and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">

      <P>Not completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Clear progress is being made in the implementation of the road network investment programme provided for in the NDP. Route by route, major improvements are being carried out or are in planning, reflecting the hugely increased investment in the roads network since the Government took office. The Government will continue to pursue vigorously the complete implementation of the ambitious road programme provided for in the NDP.</P>
      <P>This commitment to substantially increase investment in the infrastructure of the western counties is also reflected in other infrastructure areas coming within the remit of my Department. Expenditure on water and sewerage services grew from £30 million in 1997 to £87 million in 2000, an increase of 190%, while the allocation for local authority housing has grown from £30 million in 1997 to £80 million in 2001, an increase of 165%.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the foregoing and the contributions of the Ministers of State last night that investment in infrastructure in the western counties has increased in all sectors under this Government. The work of the Cabinet committee on infrastructure in prioritising and co-ordinating this investment will ensure that real benefits will be delivered to the region. The Government is determined to ensure that all areas of the country, including the western counties, have the infrastructure that will allow them to develop to their full potential and that the objective of achieving balanced economic and social development progress will be realised.</P>

This is the proof of the Government's contempt for the development and the people of the west. The people of that region will realise that after this debate, although they were probably already aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cardinal Cahal Daly, in his homily last Sunday on the re-interment of the ten volunteers, asked how the ten men who had given their lives for Irish freedom would view modern Ireland. He wondered if they would be happy to see the social exclusion that persists in our society and the decline of many rural areas, particularly in the west. His words are echoed by many people throughout the country. In my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, for example, in the past three <Col N="717" /> weeks there were job losses in Ballinamore, Dromod and Sligo town. More than 300 jobs were lost in ten days. What did the Government do? There was a squabble between two Departments over my attempt to raise the issue in the House last week. They could not agree on who had responsibility. That is what the Government is doing for the people of the west. It is also an example of rural decline. What does the Government propose to do? Nothing. No senior Minister has come to the House to take responsibility.</P>
    <P>I listened to the contributions of the Fianna Fáil Members. One would think the party had only been in Government for three weeks. Fianna Fáil has been in Government for 12 of the last 14 years and the decline of the western region, indeed many other regions, has continued. It is time that party took responsibility. We were accused of political opportunism. We are politicians. We must come to the House and raise the issues. Do the Government Members wish us to lie down and die or enter into this cosy consensus that Fianna Fáil will lead us into the future? It is our job to raise these issues. It would be a poor reflection on us as Opposition Deputies if we did not raise them. I will take every opportunity to raise instances where the Government is unwilling to provide money for the development of any region and particularly the west.</P>
    <P>I understand it is proposed to bypass Bundoran and Donegal. There has traditionally been a link with the main road from Bundoran to Donegal through the R280 which comes from Bundoran into County Leitrim. The NRA has stated that the proposed bypass will mean there will be no direct link to the R280. That traditional link between the R280 and the N15 is necessary for the future viability and development of County Leitrim. People there are amazed that the National Roads Authority proposed that motorists cannot come off a main road and travel along the main thoroughfare through County Leitrim. It shows a total lack of conviction and regard for development. We raised this issue with the NRA and under this motion the Minister has the power to raise it, but will he come into the House and answer the questions that were raised? No, he has no responsibility to the NRA. He is elected to this House and appointed to Government. While he is in Government he should be responsible for something and answerable to somebody, but he is not. He has given away all those responsibilities. If something similar was happening in some other part of the country and affecting Meath, he would give us answers and make sure that the NRA was not proposing these types of bypasses.</P>
    <P>The State of the West report was produced by the Western Development Commission a few months ago. It has two key recommendations, one being reaching the western region. The report states the Western Development Commission recommends the establishment of a west<Col N="718" /> ern region roads infrastructure consultative group chaired by a senior official in the National Roads Authority and comprising officials of the National Roads Authority, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Forfás, local authorities and the Western Development Commission. The report recommended that this group should be set up by September 2001 and report its findings together with a cost of development schedule by February 2002 with an interim report for consultation in December 2001. The Government has not uttered one word to the Western Development Commission, a statutory body established to raise issues such as this one. It has been ignored.</P>
    <P>The report's second key recommendation is powering and connecting the western region. The report states the Western Development Commission recommends the establishment of a high level strategic working group on power and telecommunications in the western region. It states the working group should be chaired by a senior official in the Department of Public Enterprise and should comprise relevant officials from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the relevant statutory bodies. It recommends that the group should be set up by September 2001 and report its findings by February 2002. The Government has ignored that recommendation. It is ignoring the people of the west and the State of the West report. That is appalling. The people of the West are very aware of that.</P>
    <P>Turning to my good friend, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, on the issue of the Clár programme. He announced its introduction with great fanfare. I am disappointed he is not present to hear what I have to say and that all the other Fianna Fáil Deputies representing the west have left because it is too hot for them in here. Some £20 million has been allocated over two years broken down into the electoral areas and divisions. That will amount to £7,500 for each electoral division over the next two years.</P>
    <P>There was a campaign in Alaska to save the whales three years ago and £100 million was allocated, but only £20 million will be allocated to save the west. If that is all the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív can do to save the west, I hope he is left sitting in the west for a long time.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív also proposed extra funding. That is not extra funding, it will come under the national development plan. It has been taken from A and put into C. When he was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for rural development, he did not want the job, he did not want to take responsibility for the Western Development Commission. It is a sop that the Taoiseach has given him £20 million, told him to go and play with it and to stay quiet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív also said he would get rid of the plethora of organisations and agencies funding the western development area, but what did he do? He established another one. As my colleague, Deputy Ring said, half of that £20 million will be spent on administration and it will not end up in the regions.</P>
    <P>The Government does not have any idea or policy on regional development. It has a very careless attitude to it, particularly to western development. It has not been able to implement a proper policy over the past four and a half years when there was more money in the State coffers than ever before. As my colleagues said, in the north west region, the western region and the BMW region as a whole there have been more job losses than jobs created. That is indicative of the way the Government has failed miserably to put in place any proper structure or any regional policy.</P>
    <P>I am looking forward to the next election and to the period after next June. We have proposed that there should be a Minister for regional development and a Department for regional development and that the necessary money would be spent on infrastructural and other developments necessary to stop the chaos on the east coast. People cannot move in this city. It is choked up with traffic and people while the west is looking for people to move there, but the Government does not have the know-how, resources or the wherewithal to introduce policies to bring in proper regional development and structures.</P>

It also called for clarification on gas and broadband technology and specifically referred to a section of the N5 that is not contained in the national development plan, the section from Ballaghaderreen to Strokestown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Roads Authority Review for 2000 to 2001 begins with the following statement, that the authority's programme caters for significant activity on the improvement of a great many other national primary roads throughout the country. It states the strategy involves eliminating bottlenecks to the construction of bypasses and substantial sections of improved road. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, in an interview reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 13 October said the spatial strategy is designed to spread that development out over the whole country. He said the car has to be tackled and it has to be tackled in Dublin. I will show the Members opposite his picture <Col N="720" /> because he is not here and he has not sent a message as to his whereabouts or why he did not come into the House to reply to this debate.</P>

      <P>Our problem is one of frustration as much as anything else. We cannot ask a question about the NRA, we cannot find any information on it through the Freedom of Information Act and it will not respond to us. It produces glossy letters and reports. This motion is borne out of frustration.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, referred to two elements of the N5 yesterday. He said rehabilitation works are being planned and carried out for sections of the N5 at the Mayo end and west of Strokestown that were damaged during last winter. Does he realise that £3.5 billion worth of freight is moved by truck through that section every year, that a major multinational from Westport has had to unload trucks on the Dublin quays to determine whether damage was inflicted on goods and it had to send representatives to Japan to explain why goods were damaged in transit? That is because of the ineffective leadership and the refusal to act on a remit given to a Minister in respect of that section of the N5. We are supposed to be content with a million pounds a year for bits and pieces of maintenance, filling of potholes and the gravelling up of sections of that road. That is appalling. It is a denial of responsibility and it is political cowardice of the worst type.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, said we should not believe all we read in these speeches. Is he saying that the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, is a liar, that he is not telling the truth? Are we public representatives expected to take at face value what is on the public record of the Dáil on behalf of the Government? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, when launching the Clár programme, which is referred to in the Government's amendment to the motion, said, that he believes the very lack of population should be a priority reason for getting investment rather than a reason for not getting it. He said we are to turn the world on its head and say that a declining area that has suffered all the classical symptoms of rural decline will now come top of the list. He went on to say we can have balance, the best that a vibrant and culturally rich rural Ireland has to offer, combined with state-of-the-art 21st century facilities. He argued that with good transport facilities and high-tech telecommunications everybody in the country could be within a 45 minute drive of a wide variety of job choices. For too long, he continued, the problems of our rural communities have been put on the back burner and thought to be insoluble. He <Col N="721" /> officially announced that the big fight back was beginning.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Job Losses.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing Deputies Naughten and McGrath and me to raise this important matter and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, for taking the debate. Like many of the employees who learned that they would lose their jobs at the William Hill betting centre in Athlone, I, like my constituency colleague, was extremely shocked by the news. There had been a number of significant tax changes recently in the betting and levying areas which I thought would be helpful in securing such employment and this added to my sense of shock. However, that was not to be in this case.</P>
      <P>The William Hill operation employed approximately 150 permanent and 150 temporary staff. The loss of 300 jobs is a major blow to the workers involved as well as the general economy of Athlone and its hinterland. The telebetting centre processed bets for customers in the United Kingdom and continental Europe and the punter who placed a bet in this fashion avoided having to pay high UK betting taxes. The centre only opened in January 2000. At the time it was viewed as a significant coup for the region that a major player in the betting industry such as William Hill chose the midlands and the move was welcomed by many of us at the time.</P>
      <P>The British Government has reacted to the incentive for bookmakers to locate in Ireland by abolishing the 9% betting tax for punters from 1 October and imposing a 5% tax on their cumulative revenue. The staff of the centre will continue to work in the short term, but that does not soften the huge blow that the dedicated and diligent staff of the William Hill centre have suffered. Many of them have mortgages, loans and other commitments similar to thousands of workers throughout Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, however, that a simple change in fiscal policy in a neighbouring jurisdiction could have such a significant adverse impact on the jobs of workers in this jurisdiction. I take seriously the comments of Stewart Kenny who has warned that three times the number of job losses that occurred in Athlone may well happen in the near future without reform of our betting tax regime. I ask the Minister of State to use every agency at his disposal, including the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, to find a new employer for the centre. It is an ultra-modern facility located beside a good transport network and I have every confidence that if the political will is there, a new tenant can be found and these workers and Athlone town can recover from this blow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing Deputies Penrose and Naughten and me to raise this important issue. The loss of 300 jobs is a major blow to the economy of any town and the families involved. The recent announcement by William Hill that it was to close its facility in Athlone came as a great shock. UK betting tax which had stood at 9% compared to a rate of 5% here was abolished with effect from 1 October and it had to be expected that companies such as William Hill would leave Ireland. The workforce at the centre comprised 150 permanent and 150 temporary staff. The Minister of State can imagine the devastation suffered by those employees and their families. Many of them left other jobs to join the William Hill organisation in the hope they would be in secure employment with a major player in the betting industry. Unfortunately, everything has crashed around them. These employees were part of a happy, competent workforce, but they do not know what the future holds for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The William Hill organisation is putting forward meagre redundancy packages for the workers. I ask the Minister of State to intervene in this regard to ensure they receive a reasonable pay-out. The job losses constitute a double blow for Athlone because the premises used for the centre was established under a business expansion scheme. This had been established by the chamber of commerce and a local builder developed the site. Consequently, many investors may also lose out. Recently 30 jobs were lost at Mallinckrodt Laboratories while Ericsson announced the loss of 22 jobs. However, the workers who leave these two companies will be <Col N="725" /> able to avail of voluntary redundancy. Whenever somebody loses his or her job, it is blow to the individual and his or her family.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to examine the possibility of establishing a task force to review the provision of additional or replacement jobs in Athlone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>This announcement is a blow to my local town, the local economy, the families involved and the region as a whole, which has been developed as a telesales centre. I hope the Minister of State will ensure the workers are given a proper redundancy package and an alternative industry will be attracted to the centre as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Penrose, McGrath and Naughten for raising this matter and express my sympathy to the employees who are to lose their jobs at the William Hill telephone betting call centre in Athlone. The centre was set up in Athlone in January 2000 to process bets for customers in Britain and Europe. The establishment of the centre created 150 permanent and 150 temporary jobs in the town. The decision to close the facility came after the British Chancellor of the Exchequer recently announced the abolition of a 9% betting tax in favour of a new system based on tax on gross profits. This company did not receive grant aid from the industrial development agencies.</P>
      <P>FÁS was in contact with the company on Monday last, 15 October 2001, to advise it of the full range of support services it could offer employees, including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses. The company indicated that discussions are still ongoing between the management of William Hill Athlone, and William Hill UK, regarding the expected number of lay-offs and the timeframe involved.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is committed to securing 50% of all new greenfield jobs for the Objective One area, of which Athlone is part. This involves doubling the proportion of greenfield jobs negotiated for these regions. IDA Ireland initially reorganised its internal structures in an effort to ensure the objective will be achieved. This restructuring included allocation of additional staff to its regional offices and allocation of regional responsibilities to key executives in its headquarters project divisions. The IDA further intends to build on this strategy by focusing in the medium term on three regional economic centres: Athlone, Sligo and Waterford. Up to one third of all IDA staff will be based in the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The headquarters for IDA regional development has been moved to Athlone from where the <Col N="726" /> new IDA divisional manager, regions and property, will direct the new regional strategy. The regional director for the midlands and west is based in the new Athlone office in addition to the midlands regional manager. The IDA's healthcare and property divisions have also been transferred to the town. The purpose is to drive growth from within the region and develop this centre as a magnet for growth for the region. These changes will bring the IDA staff complement in Athlone to between 25 and 30 in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Athlone has an industrial base of 2,569 people employed in overseas companies and is home to many leading international companies such as LM Ericsson, Elan, Mallinckrodt Laboratories, Lund and Alcatel. The town is also home to the national polymer development centre, which is a £3.8 million development located in an 18,000 sq. ft. IDA unit at the business and technology park, Garrycastle. Recent positive developments include the announcement by ICT Eurotel in July 2000 of its plans for a 100 person operation in the newly constructed advance office facility in the business and technology park. This project is progressing well ahead of target and the company already employs 135 people. The company was approved for a 77 job expansion by the IDA in June 2001. IO Systems Limited was approved for a 34 person expansion of its Athlone facility in July 2000 and MSL also announced an expansion totalling 100 jobs in Athlone last year.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland has indicated, assuming that the William Hill facility is of a suitable quality and the owner's permission is forthcoming, it would be happy to promote the building to overseas investors with a view to securing a new tenant. Enterprise lreland is working closely with its client companies and regional partners in developing and sustaining businesses in the area, enhancing the business environment, encouraging new start-up companies with strong growth potential and assisting Dublin based companies to locate their business expansions in the BMW region. Assuming that the facility becomes available it can be actively referred to by Enterprise Ireland to encourage Dublin based development companies to locate in Athlone.</P>
    <P>The development agencies will continue to market Athlone for investment and every effort will be made to secure alternative employment for the workers affected by this closure.</P>

      <P>The recent weeks have been a disastrous time for the aviation industry. The crisis which has hit the industry following the attacks on New York and Washington will also have a huge impact on related sectors in the aviation business. The FLS plant at Dublin Airport has suffered a significant down turn in business since <Col N="727" /> the events of 11 September. FLS works mainly on aircraft maintenance. Many of its customer airlines are drastically reducing their services, grounding many of their aircraft and cancelling many maintenance checks and other work. At present there is an excellent opportunity for FLS to diversify its current core business and win a substantial contract from Sikorsky to convert 12 B767 aircraft from civilian to cargo use. Winning this contract would guarantee the current jobs at FLS. However, winning the contract depends on a Government decision relating to the purchase of helicopters for search and rescue and Air Corps use.</P>
      <P>This is a crucial issue for my constituency in north Dublin. In recent months the north side has</P>
      <P>been devastated by a series of major job losses. Today the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, repeated her demand that Aer Lingus should shed more than 2,000 jobs. It now appears from newspaper reports that the Government is prepared to turn its back on 1,500 FLS workers.</P>
      <P>Three companies have bid for the Department of Defence helicopter contract. As part of its bid, Sikorsky included a number of offset deals. This is an investment the company is willing to direct towards companies in Ireland on foot of winning the contract. Offset deals are also known as industrial participation programmes. These are common features among our EU neighbours. As part of its bid for the Air Corps contract, Sikorsky outlined its investment commitments not only to FLS but to Pratt &amp; Whitney in Baldonnel and Dell computers in Limerick. It is a win win situation for Irish industry, workers and the Department of Defence. Yet, incredibly, it appears the Department will not consider the offset aspect of Sikorsky's bid because it failed to include this criteria in its original tender documents.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House this evening. I want him to explain to the House why this marvellous opportunity for high technology Irish companies to win substantial new business was ignored in drawing up the tender documents for the Air Corps helicopter contract. Industrial participation programmes are not sweeteners, as some have tried to portray them. They are an integral part of defence procurement across the EU and they ensure the State and the economy get the best value possible from a substantial investment in military equipment. It is nothing short of scandalous that the Minister allowed the tender documents to issue without reference to industrial participation programmes. At best the Minister is guilty of gross incompetence. Did he know about the practice of industrial participation but fail to appreciate the critical importance of this mechanism for companies, such as FLS?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> Opinion in Irish industry cannot believe the Government will spend up to £100 million on a helicopter contract and turn down the opportunity to secure benefits for companies in Ireland as a result. We are putting ourselves at a huge competitive disadvantage compared to our EU colleagues. I am aware that ICTU and IBEC, which are not natural bed fellows, have lobbied the Taoiseach about the added value of the Sikorsky bid. They joined the FLS workers who have expressed their views to me and other public representatives in north Dublin that this is the way forward.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister deaf to this cry for common sense to prevail? Does he have the courage to understand he is responsible for an enormous error which could undermine jobs in FLS and deprive other Irish companies of much needed investment? Does he have the dignity to recognise this error and call a halt to the current tendering process and re-issue the documents with an industrial participation clause if he cannot proceed as I have outlined this evening? The Minister's handling of this contract has not been in the best interests of all concerned. Will he give serious consideration to re-evaluating the terms of the contract documents to ensure it is in the best interests of the country and the employees of FLS and other companies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps is progressing well. This project forms part of the major investment programme upon which this Government embarked in 1997. In the three year period to 1997 investment on equipment for the Defence Forces was £95 million. In the period since I was appointed Minister almost £180 million has been invested on equipment for the Defence Forces and a £250 million investment programme, including more than £100 million for building projects, has been put in place. We are seeing the fruits of this investment throughout the Defence Forces. The equipment programme is wideranging and covers the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.</P>
      <P>I recently announced my plan to acquire an additional 20 Mowag armoured personnel carriers to complement the 40 to be delivered early next year. Major construction and refurbishment programmes, which will be funded mainly by the proceeds of sales of barracks, are now under way. The second new vessel for the Naval Service, the LE<i> Niamh</i>, was commissioned in Cork last month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The medium lift helicopter for the Air Corps forms an integral part of this major investment programme. The tender competition is at an advanced stage. The project involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third, for search and rescue purposes <Col N="729" /> as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport. Tenders were invited on 5 March 2001 and the closing date was 19 April 2001. Four tenders were received. The four companies involved are Sikorsky from the USA, EH Industries Limited from England, Eurocopter from France and CHC Scotia from Scotland. The tenders are being subjected to a comprehensive evaluation process which included visits to each of the four companies involved. This evaluation process is being undertaken by a project team comprising officials from my Department and Air Corps personnel assisted by an outside consultant. The team's report will be examined by my Department to ensure policy and procedural compliance, after which negotiations will be entered into with a selected contractor.</P>
    <P>The tender competition for the supply of the helicopters is being carried out under EU contracts procedures. The award of contract criteria set out in the tender documentation states that the contract will be awarded on the basis of the most strategically and economically advantageous tender applying the following award criteria, although not necessarily in order of priority: functional characteristics; technical merit; all maintenance and on-line technical support; after sales service and warranty terms on offer; cost and ready availability of spare parts; tender prices and life cycle costs over a nominal 20 year period. Other factors cannot be taken into account as part of the evaluation process.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice to consider offset or counter-trade issues as it is not possible to measure objectively the value of such offers in the context of the assessment of a tender. The long-term economic effects of such offers would be unquantifiable due to a variety of reasons. Negotiations on counter-trade, were it to be a consideration in the course of a tender competition, would invariably take place between the tenderer and a company or number of companies located here. In such circumstances there could be no control over the conduct of those negotiations by the Department in question. From the point of view, therefore, of maintaining a truly competitive process any consideration of counter-trade should only come into play after a decision to enter into contract negotiations with the chosen tenderer. There is no provision in the EU procurement directives for offset as a criteria for the award of contracts and, therefore, it is not the practice in my Department to consider offset in the formulation of a request for tenders. Once a decision on the merits has been made on a contract it is the practice in my Department to seek offset in Ireland in the case of major contracts. It is made clear to the contractor that there is no legal or contractual obligation to provide such offset. Many contracts have resulted in significant offset to the benefit of the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this matter on the Adjournment tonight. The payment of control of farmyard pollution grants is an issue of great concern. I have raised this issue with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development over many months because many farmers told me they had not received their payments. It is unbelievable that farmers who have been approved for these grants and who have carried out the work have not received their payments. When they received approval for these grants they believed there was enough funding in place to meet all applications. Some of the farmers have received part payment, while others have not received any payment. This is adding further strain to farmers who are already suffering the effects of the foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>
      <P>I have been told that discussions are taking place between the Department and the European Commission. Have these talks been finalised? Has approval been given by Europe? How long more will farmers have to wait for payment? I now demand that moneys and interest be paid out immediately to these farmers who have waited for a long time and who are under pressure from the banks. I am hoping the Minister will announce that these grants will be paid tomorrow morning. A farmer who owed a lot of money to the bank visited my clinic last week. As the Minister knows, the banks do not have much respect for farmers and do not listen to them. The bank now pressurising him, insisting that he must make the payments. He is under severe pressure and cried in my clinic. His nerves are gone and he is under tremendous strain. I hope the Minister will announce that he has obtained agreement from Europe.</P>
      <P>It does not make much sense to announce national and local schemes which tell farmers to go ahead, when we must await approval from Europe. We should only have to seek approval from Europe if it is needed. As this is a national scheme, the Minister should pay out, as he did for sheep farmers, even if we do not have approval from Europe. If the Minister does so, he will be doing nothing wrong. Farmers were being told that they were polluting. They are now trying to rectify the situation by adhering to the rules and protecting the countryside environment through the REP scheme. All they are asking the Minister for are grants which have been approved. All I want to hear the Minister saying is that he will start to pay out tomorrow morning. That is a simple request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should forget about Europe. The Minister is like me in this respect because there are too many rules and regulations in Europe. The Minister will have my full support and that of my colleagues and the farming community if he pays <Col N="731" /> out. If anybody from Europe contacts him, he should send them down to the west to meet the farmers. When they see the situation there for themselves they will have no hesitation in approving this scheme. I hope the Minister's response will be positive. I do not want to hear what has been said in recent weeks, which is that discussions are ongoing. The Minister, Deputy Belton and I have been discussing this matter for a long time and what we want is positive news.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion tabled by the Deputy was less than clear. I thank him, however, for raising the issue and clarifying what he meant. There are a number of schemes involved. Some relate to the package of measures launched in February this year under the national development plan, of which the farm waste management, dairy hygiene and alternative enterprises schemes are the most relevant. In addition, a number of payments remain outstanding under the older national scheme for the control of farmyard pollution.</P>
      <P>The new schemes, with the scheme of installation aid for young farmers, form part of a package of measures by means of which some £260 million is being made available over the period up to 2006. The measures which relate directly to on-farm improvements account for just under £250 million of this, the vast bulk of which, £181 million, is allocated to farm waste management projects.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, as the House is well aware, these schemes were only up and running a few weeks before the foot and mouth crisis exploded. One of the first things my Department had to do to control the imminent threat of this terrible disease was to impose an immediate ban on farm visits. This meant that none of the applications received under the new schemes could be formally approved, since the conditions of the various schemes require that inspectors from my Department visit each applicant first and examine the position for themselves. While the ban on farm visits was lifted at the end of May, the majority of these inspectors remain assigned to foot and mouth duties. This has seriously affected the rate at which applications can be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The backlog is, however, being dealt with. Up to 30 September, a total of 2,558 applications had been received under the various new farm improvement schemes. Some 2,019 of these were in respect of farm waste management projects, 396 were for dairy hygiene related works, while 143 related to alternative enterprises. As of now, over 1,200 applications have been examined by our technical inspectorate. Of these, some 600 have actually been inspected on the ground and given approval to proceed. As I said, however, the main problem we face is that so many of our <Col N="732" /> inspectors remain assigned to critical foot and mouth duties and while the threat of this disease remains live, we cannot afford to relax our vigilance.</P>
    <P>In order to speed up the rate at which the remaining applications can be approved my Department has sought permission from the European Commission to reduce the level of pre-approval inspections required. We hope, as a temporary measure, we can avoid having to carry out inspections in every case and instead approve most remaining applications on the basis of a detailed desk check. The Commission is considering our request.</P>
    <P>With regard to all these new schemes, however, it is important to stress that no payments are actually outstanding to any applicant. The challenge for my Department has been to process and approve the backlog of applications which quite unavoidably developed during the period of the foot and mouth restrictions.</P>
    <P>As regards the older scheme &ndash; I now understand this was probably the Deputy's main concern &ndash; the national scheme for the control of farm pollution is probably the one about which there is most concern. This scheme came into operation on 28 June 1999 as a state aid with formal approval from the Commission which the Deputy should note for expenditure of up to £15 million. The scheme proved highly successful and applications far exceeded all expectations. Up to May this year, my Department had made payments amounting to nearly £15 million under the scheme, in respect of 2,400 individual applicants, and therefore reached the ceiling imposed by the European Commission. By that stage, my Department had already been in discussion with the Commission about raising the ceiling for payments under the scheme. This is very much a technical issue and one which my Department has been vigorously pursuing with the Commission for a number of months. There are a series of formal procedures through which applications of this nature have to be processed in the Commission, and these take time to complete. All state aid applications are handled in this way. As a result, some 650 payments have been delayed, temporarily. However, as indicated in reply to a number of parliamentary questions, formal written approval is expected very shortly. All payments have been prepared and are ready to issue. We expect this to take no more than a matter of days.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has proposed an easy solution in this case, but in view of other matters we are negotiating with Brussels, it would be the equivalent of trying to rush sheep into the pen. As a good west of Ireland man, the Deputy knows that well.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Medical Use of Cannabis.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this issue for two reasons. First, I want to separate clearly the use of cannabis or hemp plant for medicinal and recreational purposes. This line is constantly being blurred both by those arguing for the general legalisation of cannabis and those who want its prohibition to continue. It is about time we stated the difference between the potential benefits of agents within the cannabis or hemp plant for medicinal purposes and its use, primarily by smoking, for recreational purposes.</P>
      <P>Second, I want to assure parents and others that the potential of introducing cannabis or agents within the cannabis plant for medicinal purposes should not frighten people. If it can be shown that there are clear medical benefits from these agents, we should look carefully at the possibility of changing the law to legalise them. A serious debate on recreational drug use is needed, but first we need to put to bed the issue of cannabis for medicinal purposes which should not be allowed to distract or influence that debate. It is an entirely separate issue.</P>
      <P>What is meant by medicinal cannabis? It is likely that cannabis will be legalised for medicinal purposes in the UK within two years. Clinical trials on patients with multiple sclerosis, cancer and arthritis have proved encouraging. Tests on 70 British patients show that an extract of the plant sprayed under the tongue or taken in tablet form can significantly reduce pain, muscle spasms and bladder problems. As the doses used in the trials are relatively low, patients do not experience the so-called &ldquo;high&rdquo; which many recreational users seek. Large scale trials involving up to 2,000 patients are under way in the UK and should be completed by 2003.</P>
      <P>Cannabis contains active ingredients called cannabinoids which alleviate pain, reduce tremors and prevent incontinence. The drug can be sprayed under the tongue so it is absorbed into the bloodstream rather than being swallowed, inhaled or smoked. The applicator allows patients to regulate their dose depending on their level of illness. It is similar to an inhaler used in the treatment of asthma. The UK Government confirmed to the House of Lords science and technology select committee that it would be willing to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1971, to allow the prescription of cannabis-based medicines if trial results continue to be positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the health concerns regarding can<Col N="734" /> nabis focus on the toxic effects of cannabis smoke. However, these arguments do not apply as we are not talking about patients smoking cannabis, but taking it in tablet or spray form. Parents or those who view the legalisation of cannabis for medical use as the first step towards the legalisation of the drug generally, are sorely mistaken. According to this rationale, morphine, for example, which is the main agent in heroin, would not be available on prescription as a painkiller. We all recognise the benefits of morphine as a painkiller in extreme circumstances.</P>
    <P>The negative aspects of smoking cannabis as a recreational drug are well known and more than convince me that we should not legalise the drug for recreational use under any circumstances. As regards the short-term effects such as memory loss or distorted perception, or the long-term and more important carcinogenic effects, the recreational smoking of cannabis is unacceptable and the drug should not be legalised. However, the medicinal benefits should be examined in detail. We should separate the issues, examine the potential positive effects and support and take an interest in the research under way in the UK. Canada has already legalised the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes and I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and, on behalf of the Minister, giving me the opportunity to clarify the position regarding cannabis. As the Deputy will know a new national drugs strategy, 2001 to 2008, entitled Building on Experience was launched by the Taoiseach in May this year. The overall objective of the strategy is to significantly reduce the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. The document sets out 100 actions regarding tackling the drugs problem and has also identified key performance indicators which will help measure the effectiveness of these actions. In the consultation process leading up to the publication of the document there was little or no debate about the medicinal use of cannabis. The Deputy has clearly outlined his stance on this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cannabis is a Schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984. It is also one of the controlled drugs which has been designated for the purposes of section 13 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977. The nature of the controls provided in this manner are those which, according to the current UN conventions on narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, must be applied to substances such as cannabis and cannabis resin, for which there is no current recognised medical or scientific use. Under these laws the manufacture, possession, supply, and pre<Col N="735" /> scription of the drug are prohibited, except under licence from the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>By virtue of the designation under section 13 of the Act, licences may be granted for the purpose of research or forensic analysis, or in respect of the use of the drug as an essential intermediate or starting material in an industrial manufacturing process. Furthermore, the Minister for Health and Children must be satisfied in regard to the scientific or medical justification offered in support of the grant of any licence involving any of the designated controlled drugs such as cannabis. Licences may also be granted in the case of certain low tetrahydrocannabinol plant varieties of cannabis for the growing of hemp. I am aware that claims are being made in respect of cannabis <Col N="736" /> concerning the possible benefits for patients suffering from certain conditions such as multiple sclerosis and glaucoma. However, these medical claims are not currently supported by the results of recognised medical research.</P>
    <P>In order to conduct research into the medicinal use of cannabis in this country, a permission from the Irish Medicines Board would be required. If the Irish Medicines Board was to grant such a permission under the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, to facilitate conducting a trial in respect of a medicinal product containing cannabis, the Minister for Health and Children would be prepared to give serious consideration to the granting of the necessary licence(s) under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 October 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 102 of 27 March 2001 and 67 of 20 June 2001.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &ndash; RPII &ndash; carries out a marine radioactivity monitoring and research programme, the results of which are produced and published by the RPII in a series of bi-annual reports.</P>
      <P>Details of the level of discharges of radioactive waste from the Sellafield plant and radioactivity contamination of the Irish marine environment arising from such discharges in respect of the years 1998 and 1999 are set out in the RPII's Report on Radioactivity Monitoring of the Irish Marine Environment 1998 and 1999 which was published by the RPII in September 2000. Monitoring data for the year 2000 and the first quarter of this year are available on the RPII's website &ndash; www.rpii.ie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significant source of radioactive contamination in the Irish Sea is the discharge of low level radioactive liquid waste from BNFL's <Col N="738" /> nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield. The RPII has advised me that based on its monitoring and sampling activities to date in 2001, there is no evidence of any increase in the level of radioactivity contamination of the Irish marine environment arising from Sellafield. However, the fact that such contamination should occur is objectionable and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that in 1998 the contracting parties to the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, which includes the UK, adopted a strategy on radioactive substances. This strategy has as its objective the virtual elimination by the year 2020 of all radioactive discharges to the marine environment covered by the convention, which includes the Irish Sea. Ireland took a prominent role in the development of this strategy and work is continuing within OSPAR to achieve the strategy's objective.</P>
    <P>Since the adoption of this strategy, Ireland has been actively involved at subsequent meetings of the OSPAR Commission in 1999, 2000 and again this year with a view to giving added impetus to the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    <P>Following the adoption of the OSPAR strategy, the UK began a review of radioactive discharge authorisations which, according to the UK, is aimed at meeting its obligations under the strategy. This review, which is the subject of a series of public consultations by the UK, is ongoing. Since September 2000, my Department has responded to the three public consultations held to date by the UK in the context of this review and is preparing to respond to the latest public consultation round which finishes in December.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government is determined to ensure the UK's review of discharge authorisation limits is fully consistent with its commitments under OSPAR. Notwithstanding, the OSPAR strategy, the Irish Government is committed to bringing about a cessation of nuclear reprocessing activities at Sellafield, which are the primary source of radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea, and will continue to exert maximum pressure on the UK Government and within OSPAR to achieve this objective.</P>

      <P>The terms and conditions of AER V incorporate two recommendations from the report, Strategy for Intensifying Wind Energy Deployment, by the Renewable Energy Strategy Group which included a representative of the Irish Wind Energy Association. The group recommended that AER V should be restricted to projects with planning consent and should incorporate a fixed price offer based on prices delivered in AER III.</P>
      <P>The competition is confined to projects with planning consent and the price caps are based on the most efficient price in each category paid by the ESB under AER III. These prices were adjusted upwards for justified reasons. At the launch of AER V in May this year, I stated publicly that my preference was for a keen fixed price. I also explained that in the course of informal discussions with the European Commission on the state aids element it was indicated that a fixed price procedure could raise complex competition issues which could take up to 18 months to resolve. Alternatively, it was indicated that the inclusion of a bidding element would be less contentious and more in keeping with current State aids guidelines. It was indicated that a final determination could be reached in about six months in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>On this basis I accepted the competitive option to ensure early progress at the national level. Applicants are now free to bid at or below the cap prices. I am confident product will be delivered in AER V and a subsequent support measure will ensure delivery of the overall 500 MW target by 2005.</P>

      <P>The telecommunications market in Ireland has been fully liberalised from December 1998 and competition has been developing since then. To facilitate competition, a regulatory regime, supervised by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, is in place. This regime, which is in line with a framework adopted at EU level, involves the imposition of specified obligations on telecommunications operators which have been designated by the director as having significant market power in the voice telephony, leased lines, mobile and interconnection markets.

The group recommended that AER V should be restricted to projects with planning consent which would restrict the number of qualifying applicants and should also incorporate prices based on those delivered in AER III.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, in preparation for AER V, my Department invited representative bodies involved in the renewable energy market to submit proposals on appropriate pricing levels. The responses received, including that of the Irish Wind Energy Association, were examined within my Department. The submissions received contributed towards additional increases allowed above the most efficient AER III prices in the published price caps in each category of AER V for justified reasons.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that representations have been received from a number of persons and organisations regarding the terms and conditions of the competition. The competition is being conducted in accordance with EU law on procurement including a requirement to publish relevant information in the Official Journal of the European Communities in the first instance. I do not propose to comment further, therefore, on matters relating to the terms and conditions of the competition until after the closing</P>
      <P>date for receipt of tenders on the 30 November next.</P>

      <P>It is useful to define what is meant by the terms &ldquo;red alert&rdquo; and &ldquo;amber alert&rdquo;. A red alert occurs when there is a significant deviation from the normal operating standard, signalling an &ldquo;emergency state&rdquo; in regard to power. An amber alert occurs when there is a contraction in the normal operating reserve caused, for example, by the tripping of a large generating unit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 44 together</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann informs me that, in addition to the DART service improvements, it is progressing with the upgrading of the railway track from Greystones southwards to Rosslare. Work on this line commenced in 1999. The work is being done with assistance of Exchequer and EU funding under the national development plan and £2.5 million, 3.7 million, will have been spent on trackwork in the period to end 2001.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has revised its estimate for relaying track in 2001 from 17 to 19 miles on the line between Greystones and Rosslare, with the entire line being relaid by 2003. In addition, work is under way on bridge renewal, coastal defence, level crossings and fencing. It is expected that when all the work is completed, the journey times over the route will be reduced.</P>
      <P>As part of the national development plan, Iarnród Éireann has ordered 60 diesel railcars for delivery during 2002 and 2003. These vehicles will be used throughout the Iarnród Éireann system including services on the Dublin to Rosslare line which will improve the quality of service provided to passengers.</P>
      <P>The question of upgrading or refurbishment of railway stations along the route is a day-to-day matter for the company concerned and not one in which I have a function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, sponsored by me, approximately 31% of the electricity market is now open to competition, subject to the oversight of the independent Commission for Electricity Regulation. Ireland has already gone beyond the minimum requirements of market opening set down in the electricity directive. In addition, both the markets for &ldquo;green&rdquo; energy and for combined heat and power have been fully liberalised.</P>
      <P>Independent power producers and suppliers have shown considerable interest in entering the Irish electricity market. In that regard, it is worth noting that the Commission for Electricity Regulation considers the opening of the market has been a success, on balance, with more than 50% of eligible customers moving to licensed suppliers and almost 6,000 customers to &ldquo;green&rdquo; suppliers.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to the phased liberalisation of the electricity industry in Ireland. Market opening is being accelerated but not rushed. In Ireland, we are moving from a monopoly situation to a competitive market in an industry with relatively long lead times for investment. Such change needs to be conceived and effected in an orderly and measured manner to ensure the benefits are lasting and long-term.</P>
      <P>In February 2002, market opening will increase to 40%. Arrangements are under way to obtain the necessary positive resolution of both this House and of the Seanad prior to my signing the eligible customer order, under section 27 of the Electricity Regulation Act, to provide for this next phase of market opening. Following this, as previously announced, we will move to full market opening in 2005 when every single electricity consumer will be eligible to choose their electricity supplier. Consideration is also being given to the possibility of an interim step of 66% market opening prior to that date, in line with current proposals from the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>The opening of the electricity market has meant that to create a level playing field between all market participants, the Government's public service requirements need to be transparently identified and costed. These public service obligations relate to the use of peat-fired generation and renewable or alternative generation, for reasons of security of supply and environmental protection respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, to ensure the Government's energy policy objectives are met, I propose, subject to <Col N="744" /> EU Commission approval, to introduce a Public Service Obligation &ndash; PSO &ndash; order in the near future.</P>
    <P>The PSO order, which will be underpinned by power purchase agreements, is intended to lead to the construction of two new peat stations by ESB by 2005, in line with the orderly closure of existing peat stations. The new peat stations will be in addition to the peat station at Edenderry built by Fortum, which came into commercial operation in December 2000.</P>
    <P>The PSO order will also cover the purchase by ESB of the output of certain renewable, sustainable and alternative generators which were successful under previous Government sponsored alternative energy requirement, AER and EU competitions.</P>
    <P>Green certificates or green credits are alternative support measures unique to the renewable energy based electricity market. They are an alternative means of supporting the production of electricity from renewable energy technologies. There is no provision in national law at this time for green credits or green certificates. However, I understand some questions have been raised with the Minister of State about trading in such products and legal advice is awaited on the issue.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of public electricity supplies in respect of pricing levels, price methodology and break clauses, I should point out that I have no function in relation to this matter. Under regulation 31 of the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations, 2000 made by me, the Commission for Electricity Regulation has been given the function of examining charges, and the costs underlying such charges, for electricity supplied by ESB to franchise customers, that is, those who are not supplied by the competitive market. The regulations also give the commission the power, following such an examination, to issue directions to both the nature and the amount of any such charge.</P>
    <P>The commission has also been given the function, under Regulation 31, of facilitating arrangements, approved by it, to apply until 19 February 2005, which have the effect of securing that the ESB is able to satisfy demand for electricity from final customers, who are not supplied independently, in the first instance from generating stations currently owned by the board.</P>

      <P>Aer Rianta inform me that it has committed a total of IR£86 million or 109 mill<Col N="745" /> ion to the development programme at Cork Airport. The main features of this programme are a 25,000 square metre terminal building with associated air-bridge and hold baggage screening facilities. A multi-storey car park for 600 cars will also form part of the programme.</P>
      <P>As regards the timescale for completion, I understand from Aer Rianta that the company lodged the necessary planning application with Cork County Council in August. Consideration of the application is expected to take about three months. On receipt of planning permission a detailed tendering process will be initiated and work will commence as early as possible after completion of this process. As of now, all going well, Aer Rianta anticipate a likely start date in the coming spring.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the recent downturn in the global aviation industry will affect Aer Rianta's development plans for Cork Airport. Despite recent events and the earlier foot and mouth disease epidemic in the UK, Aer Rianta believes that passenger traffic at Cork Airport could reach 1.75 million this year representing growth of almost 4% compared to 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said on previous occasions, questions about the future ownership of commercial State companies fall to be determined on a case by case basis in the context of developments in their main business areas.</P>
      <P>The following is the position in relation to the commercial State companies, under my aegis. A change in the ownership of Aer Lingus is not now an issue in the current circumstances.</P>
      <P>In regard to the CIÉ group of companies, the consultation paper entitled, A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport, was published by the Government in September 2000. It sets out a number of proposals in relation to the restructuring of the CIÉ companies including the possible privatisation of the bus companies. These proposals are currently the subject of consultation with the Public Transport Partnership Forum which was established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>No Government decision has been taken in respect of the recommendation of the board of Aer Rianta that there be an IPO of a minority shareholding in that company. There are no plans to privatise the IAA, which was incorporated as a commercial State company in 1994 and is the safety regulator and the provider of air navigation services in Irish-controlled airspace.</P>
      <P>There are currently no plans with regard to the flotation or privatisation of the ESB. I wrote to the chairman of the ESB and invited the board to let me have its views on the future direction of the ESB including such issues as alliances, strategic partnerships, structure and ownership. I also encouraged the board and the ESB group of unions to discuss this matter together.</P>
      <P>The board concluded in January 2001, having taken full account of the submissions from ESB management and unions, that the essential conditions for a successful change of ownership did not prevail at that time. Therefore, the board decided that it would be inappropriate to proceed with a change of ownership recommendation at that stage. The board also decided to urgently pursue with the ESB group of unions, in a spirit of partnership, the development of a comprehensive strategy for the future development and growth of ESB.</P>
      <P>I welcome the efforts taken to date by the board, the management and unions in relation to this important issue. I respect the conclusion arrived at by the board. I am confident that all parties will work together in a spirit of openness and partnership to develop this partnership strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> There are currently no plans with regard to a privatisation of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>In response to a request by the Minister of State on 5 November 1999 for the board to consider all options for its future, the board presented a strategy that favoured an IPO to best meet the financial and commercial needs of the company as deregulation progresses. This matter is still under consideration but the enactment of legislation to establish BGE as a public limited company is a prerequisite, and this is unlikely to be achieved in the life of this Dáil. In view of the present position regarding the legislative programme, I have asked the board of BGE to consider alternative options for meeting the current financial and commercial needs of the company.</P>
    <P>It is important to have clarity in the regulatory environment. In this regard, a Bill to transfer the gas regulatory functions of the Minister to the Commission for Electricity Regulation has been passed by the Seanad and is awaiting Second Stage in the Dáil. I am hopeful that the Bill will be enacted by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Last year I authorised An Post to examine options regarding a possible strategic alliance with one of the major European operators. The necessity to do this arises from competitive pressures both from the liberalisation of the market and the consolidation which is taking place in the European postal industry, driven by the four main players, the post offices of Germany, Holland, Britain and France.</P>
    <P>While I am kept informed of developments, the investigation by An Post into alliance possibilities is an ongoing process. I understand that there are indications of interest but it is too early yet to judge the eventual outcome. I expect An Post to report to me on this matter later this year.</P>
    <P>While privatisation is not currently envisaged or planned for An Post, the Postal (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill currently before the Dáil does provide for private equity holding in the event of the company forming a strategic alliance with another European postal operator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the urgent need for additional peak-hour capacity in the greater Dublin area, the national development plan provides for significant investment in suburban rail services including DART.</P>
      <P>In the past 12 months, 26 new DART cars have entered service. They are to be supplemented next year by a further 12. Iarnród Éireann holds options on a further 36 DART cars.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has also developed investment proposals for a major upgrade in the DART network to provide further significant increases in capacity beyond 2002. The proposals provide for the lengthening of platforms to accommodate eight car trains, a major upgrade of the signalling capacity to allow an increased number of trains in the city centre area and increased power supply for operating the enhanced network.</P>
      <P>My Department is in ongoing discussion with Iarnród Éireann in relation to these proposals. Some £3.5 million or 4.45 million was allocated by my Department in 2001 in respect of planning and design work for the DART upgrades. Further details of the timescales involved will be determined as planning and design progresses.</P>
      <P>As far as other suburban services are concerned, Iarnród Éireann have placed orders for 80 diesel rail cars for use throughout their net-work. These will be funded under the national development plan and from Iarnród Éireann's own resources. Some of these cars will be used to replace outdated stock on the outer suburban lines, while others will be used to provide higher capacity and more frequent services throughout the network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputies may be aware, the DART depot in Fairview was the scene of a very serious fire earlier this year. I am informed by Iarnród <Col N="751" /> Éireann that four DART cars were destroyed while a further four suffered damage which will require major refurbishment. This removes a total of eight cars from daily service and has led to some reduction in capacity at peak hours. However, I understand from Iarnród Éireann that there are no two-car DART sets operating at peak hours.</P>

In its contribution to the development of the plan, I have been supporting the introduction of quality bus corridors through the provision of very significant investment, under the national development plan, in new buses in the city by Bus Éireann in recent years.</P>
      <P>I am happy to note that Cork Corporation, in co-operation with Bus Éireann, has embarked on a study to consider the development of two quality bus corridors in Cork. I understand that surveys are currently under way on the Bishopstown to city centre and Grange-Douglas to city centre routes and I would hope that bus corridors can be implemented on these routes as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The potential consequences for Ireland of a terrorist attack on the Sellafield plant, similar to the attack on the World Trade Center, would essentially be of the same nature as those of a major accident at the plant.</P>
      <P>The consequences of such a terrorist attack would, therefore, come within the scope of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents. This plan is designed to respond to a major disaster at a nuclear installation in the UK or elsewhere which would result in a major release of radioactivity into the atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual consequences in a particular accident situation would depend primarily on the quantity of radioactivity released and on the prevailing weather conditions, especially the wind direction. Under the national emergency plan, an <Col N="752" /> assessment team, comprising scientists from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, assisted by Met Éireann personnel, would assemble promptly and, on the basis of available information, provide advice as to the likely extent of effects on Ireland, how soon those effects might be experienced, and what areas of the country would be likely to be affected. This information would in turn provide a basis for advice as to appropriate counter-measures to be put in place.</P>
    <P>I understand that concerns about a terrorist strike on Sellafield or other nuclear installation have raised public questions about our preparedness to deal with the consequences of a nuclear accident. However, I can assure this House that our national emergency plan is designed to ensure a rapid, co-ordinated and effective response to any such accident or disaster.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my response to Private Notice Questions on 4 October 2001. In that response, I outlined the Government's concerns about the UK government's decision to give the go-ahead to the Sellafield MOX plant and the legal action which the Irish Government has embarked upon.</P>
      <P>The legal action against the UK under the OSPAR Convention is proceeding on schedule and an arbitration tribunal is in the process of being established under that convention to consider this case. On 5 October 2001, officials from my Department, accompanied by Ireland's legal advisers, met their UK counterparts to discuss the legal procedures associated with the establishment of the tribunal. At that meeting, the Irish delegation also reiterated the Irish Government's total opposition to the MOX plant. In addition to the continuing progress of the legal action under OSPAR, the Irish Government is finalising consideration of further legal options under both EU and UN law. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also written to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for Health reiterating Ireland's <Col N="754" /> opposition to the MOX plant and calling on the UK government to suspend with immediate effect the authorisation of the MOX plant and to take the necessary steps to halt, also with immediate effect, all transportations of radioactive materials in and around the Irish Sea to and from the MOX plant. I have also informed them that we will be deciding on further legal actions under EU and-or UN law in the near future.</P>
    <P>In my reply to the Private Notice Questions on 4 October 2001, I also outlined the depth of the Irish Government's opposition to the MOX plant conveyed repeatedly to the UK government over the past number of years. In addition, the Taoiseach has personally conveyed to Prime Minister Blair the Irish Government's implacable opposition to the decision to proceed with the MOX plant.</P>
    <P>With regard to the interdepartmental committee on Sellafield and nuclear affairs, I presume the Deputy is referring to the Ministerial Committee on Nuclear Safety which was established by Government in 1998 and whose broad terms of reference encompass all matters relating to nuclear safety and radiological protection as well as the ongoing campaign against Sellafield.</P>
    <P> This committee has not met since the UK Government's decision of 3 October 2001 on the MOX plant. However, the proposed MOX plant is among a number of Sellafield related issues which have been on the committee's work programme for some time now. The MOX plant and the Government's campaign against the plant is a key agenda item. The Government's approach and opposition to the plant has been discussed and supported at numerous meetings of the committee since the committee was established in 1998.</P>
    <P>The basic objective of the Irish Government's legal action in regard to the MOX plant is to over-turn the UK government's decision of 3 October 2001 and the Government is determined to achieve that objective by every means possible.</P>

      <P>A study into the possibility of re-opening the Cork to Midleton rail line, commissioned by Iarnród Éireann, was completed in 2000 at a cost of £25,000 or 31,744. The Cork Area Strategic Plan, commissioned by Cork Corporation and Cork County Council, has also <Col N="755" /> examined the potential for re-opening the line to Midleton and also for developing services to Blarney. While both of these studies are broadly favourable towards re-opening the Midleton line, they are strategic in character and what is needed now is a feasibility study that would examine in greater detail the prospects for developing such a service. </P>
      <P>As a next step, Iarnród Éireann have now undertaken to carry out a feasibility study so that all aspects of this proposal, technical, commercial and economic, can be examined in depth. My officials have made it clear to the two local authorities in Cork that this commitment is contingent on the adoption by the local authorities of the land use strategy which complements the rail strategy in the Cork Area Strategic Plan.

      <P>I am aware that the committee has been reviewing existing aviation security procedures for Irish aviation in the light of the current security situation, strengthened existing procedures and is examining specific security proposals.</P>
      <P>It is not the practice on security grounds to disclose details of any aviation security measures that have been or will be put in place at airports but I wish to assure Deputies that appropriate measures are being taken to safeguard civil aviation in Ireland.</P>

      <P>In September 1999 I published a Green Paper on Sustainable Energy, which, among other things, sets a course for the further development of our renewable energy resources to 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> In the Green Paper I set a revised target of 500 megawatts of additional renewable energy based generating capacity to be built by 2005. This equated to about 12% of production.</P>
    <P>The 500 megawatt target will be implemented in the main through the alternative energy requirement programme administered by my Department. In May this year I launched the fifth competition in the series, more commonly referred to as AER V with a closing date for receipt of tenders of 30 November.</P>
    <P>Through AER V, I have put on offer contracts for 255 megawatts of renewable energy based electricity generating plant in large wind, small scale wind, biomass and small scale hydro. The amount of capacity on offer is the largest yet under the AER programme. It represents approximately half the target I set for the period up to 2005. In addition, renewable energy electricity generating projects totalling 18 megawatts installed capacity have been built to date supplying green electricity to the liberalised electricity market.</P>
    <P>In regard to the balance of the 500 megawatt target, it is my intention in the light of interest in AER V and comments received to bring forward a further support measure to ensure the additional capacity can be delivered by 2005 under reasonable assumptions.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department is involved in a range of cross-departmental activities and initiatives, including many groups set up by other Departments. The task forces and special committees set up in my Department since 1997 are as follows.</P>
      <P>The Information Society Commission was established in May 1997 for an initial three year period until end-2000. It produced its third and final report to Government in December 2000.</P>
      <P>Its terms of reference were as follows:</P>
      <P>The Commission will have the function of shaping and overseeing the implementation of a strategic framework for the development of the Information Society in Ireland. The Commission will promote, co-ordinate and monitor the implementation of the actions required from Government and other key actors in the development of the Information Society. In particular, the Commission will:</P>
      <P>1.identify quantifiable benchmarks for the development of an Information Society in Ireland and monitor the achievement of these benchmarks on an annual basis; relevant state agencies, Departments and private sector groups will be asked to assist the Commission by providing status reports and evaluations on a regular basis on the development of the Information Society within their areas of responsibility and expertise;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> 2.both develop and implement awareness programmes itself and in conjunction with relevant state agencies, Departments, and private sector groups, targeted at all sectors of the community on the benefits and opportunities of the Information Society;</P>
    <P>3.recommend measures to increase access to information and communications technologies in homes, schools, businesses and public offices, and particularly measures aimed at those in disadvantaged groups;</P>
    <P>4.establish advisory groups which would highlight specific sectoral issues with respect to the Information Society and develop recommendations for action;</P>
    <P>5.encourage and monitor Information Society initiatives especially at local and regional level in the delivery of public services and information;</P>
    <P>6.prepare an annual report for submission by the Taoiseach on the Commission's behalf to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Membership of a new Information Society Commission will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group to examine and report on options for the future development of the Grangegorman site in Dublin city was set up by Government in May of this year. The group is chaired by my Department. Its terms of reference are as follows:</P>
    <P>To examine how the Grangegorman site can best be developed to achieve Government policy priorities in meeting education and social service needs and in tackling construction industry capacity constraints. This will be done in a way, which takes into account the overall development of Dublin and leverages the strategic location and commercial potential of the site to attract private involvement on a PPP basis, having particular regard to the following: access by the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) at the earliest possible date to facilities needed for apprenticeship training, with site occupation as from the academic year 2001-2002; provision, on a staged basis over the longer-term, of modern campus facilities needed by Dublin Institute of Technology in the context of Government policy for 3rd level education as a whole; provision in the short-term, as part of the package, of non-acute units needed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA) &ndash; on part of the campus, but also on other sites in the region &ndash; taking account of the investment in kind by the authority; arrangements to afford the local community access to playing field facilities on the campus; and integration of the proposed campus development with Luas and other relevant public transport provision.</P>
    <P>An approach to financing that includes leverage of the site's strategic location and commercial potential to lessen the burden on the <Col N="760" /> Exchequer and avoids circular transfer of funds between Votes.</P>
    <P>Membership of the working group includes representatives of the ERHA, Dublin Institute of Technology, Dublin Corporation, the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Public Enterprise, Finance and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The group first met on 16 May 2001 and has met on five occasions since. I understand that the group should be able to complete its work and submit a report to Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Grangegorman site is of strategic importance in the context of Dublin as a whole. My Department is working with the other Departments and agencies represented on the working group to ensure that its strategic location and potential is unlocked to best meet the Government's objectives in the provision of high quality health and education services and I am confident that this will be done.</P>
    <P>The Steering Committee on the National Anti-Poverty Strategy involving the social partners, was established in July 2001 to oversee phase II of the review of the NAPS.</P>
    <P>The steering group to examine basic income proposals, involving the social partners, was established in July 1997, to fulfil a commitment made in Partnership 2000. The group's role was to oversee a commissioned study which would take into account the work of the ESRI, CORI, the Expert Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare and international research on the implications of introducing a basic income system. The overall purpose of the study was to consider and evaluate the economic, social, budgetary and administrative impact of the introduction of a basic income in Ireland on the basis of the proposal outlined by CORI in, Pathways to a Basic Income. The group concluded its deliberations and its report was published in March 2001.</P>
    <P>The Expert Group on the Treatment of Foreign Donations was established by Government in February 2001 to assist Government in its examination of the constitutional and other matters concerning the treatment of foreign donations. The expert group reported to Government in April.</P>
    <P>The Foot and Mouth Task Force was established by Government in February following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK to co-ordinate and manage the national response to the threat posed by the disease. The measures implemented have proven successful in preventing the spread of the disease.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 11 September, a high level contact group was established to monitor developments. The group had its first meeting on 12 September and it reported to Cabinet on 18 September. The group has continued to meet as a support to Departments and agencies involved in emergency planning. In particular, the group assists those Departments and agencies to identify additional threats arising <Col N="761" /> from the changed international environment which need to be taken on board in their emergency plans. Since the establishment of the Office of Emergency Planning the group has been chaired by the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>A quality customer service working group was established in 1999. It had its first meeting on 3 November 1999. It was set up with the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>To monitor and evaluate progress at the level of Departments and offices and across the Civil Service; to develop mechanisms for sharing experiences and good practice at the level of Departments and offices and across the Civil Service; to oversee the development of mechanisms for benchmarking and for recognising improvement in quality service delivery; and to develop better internal customer service focus to drive external customer service in tandem with the business planning process.</P>
    <P>Some of the aspects of QCS in which the working group has recently been engaged include the preparation of a practical guide to support Departments in preparing its new three year customer action plans. These plans incorporate the key principles of quality customer service, such as the need to set standards; to have high standards of access and information; to deliver services with timeliness and courtesy; to have systems for complaints, appeals and consultation; to foster a more co-ordinated an integrated approach to service delivery, with particular regard to the potential for e-Government; and to incorporate measures on equality and diversity, including the provision of services in Irish.</P>
    <P>The group has also been engaged in the development of a support pack on the equality-diversity aspect of QCS to assist Departments in addressing the new area of equality and diversity. This is particularly important in view of the requirements placed on all service providers by the Equal Status Act, 2000.</P>
    <P>It has commissioned research in the area of equality and diversity to support Departments in applying this principle in practice and established a network of QCS officers &ndash; the people in Departments who have practical responsibility for supporting QCS policy. The network meets regularly to share experiences and good practice and to develop the expertise of its members.</P>
    <P>The group has also examined the possibility of introducing an accreditation scheme for customer service for the civil and public service.</P>
    <P>The National Millennium Committee was established in November 1998 to make recommendations on projects, including funding, for inclusion in the Government's Millennium Programme 1999-2000 and to set up a system for supporting commemorative events at local and community levels. A fund of £33 million was provided in the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach. A millennium office, based in the Department provides the secretariat to the committee, the cost of which is met from the millennium fund. <Col N="762" /> Almost 2,400 projects and events were supported including flagship projects such as the millennium candle and the millennium forest.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that by January 2002, a comprehensive publication, detailing all of the millennium projects will be published and copies will be placed in the Library.</P>
    <P>The Cross-Departmental Team on Infrastructure and PPPs was established in 1999. The team supports the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure and PPPs in the delivery of priority national infrastructure. The team continues to meet on a regular basis and has published its most recent progress report in April 2001.</P>
    <P>The NDP Communications Strategy Group was established in 2000. This group oversees the co-ordination of the overall national development plan communications strategy and continues to meet.</P>
    <P>The IFSC eCommerce Working Group was established in 2000 and considered the implications of eBusiness for the international financial services sector. It published two reports and completed its work in January 2001.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on Road Haulage was established in September 2000 with the aim of bringing forward a programme of action for regulating abuses in the industry and increasing the professionalism of the industry generally. It completed its work and published a report in January 2001.</P>
    <P>Steering committees dealing with the Sports Campus Ireland and Digital Hub Project have been transferred to the Departments of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Department of Public Enterprise, respectively.</P>

      <P>The insurance compensation fund levy was introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA in 1983.</P>
      <P>Levies were paid by all non-life insurers at a rate of 2% of gross premium income until 31 December 1991. The rate was reduced to 1% from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992. Some £148 million was collected by way of the levy, which is used to finance the administration of Primor plc. The levy ceased to apply from 1 January 1993. The administrator is continuing to run off claims incurred prior to that date under the name Primor plc. Approximately £18 million remains in the fund.</P>
      <P>The insurance compensation fund is maintained and administered by the accountant of the High Court, acting under the control of the president of the High Court. Moneys in the fund may only be drawn down in the event of the liquidation of an Irish authorised non-life insurance company, pursuant to section 31 of the Insurance Act, 1989.</P>

      <P>IFI, Irish Fertiliser Industries Limited, was formed in 1987 from a joint venture between Nitrigín Éireann Teoranta, NET, and Imperial Chemical Industries plc &ndash; ICI. NET then became the holding company for the State's 51% shareholding in IFI, with the remaining 49% shareholding owned by ICI.</P>
      <P>I am aware that ICI is keen to sell its shareholding in IFI. The Government would sell the State's 51% shareholding in IFI only if a suitable purchaser was found for the company. There is no active sale process at present because market conditions are not considered suitable for a successful sale.</P>
      <P>IFI mainly produces chemical fertilisers. I understand that IFI's plant and equipment is not suited to the manufacture of organic based fertilisers or composts. The company have advised me that all animal manure is already recycled by farmers and that, with good nutrient management planning, fertiliser is used to supply the outstanding balance of nutrients for crop production after taking due account of the contribution from animal manure. IFI strongly advocates proper nutrient management planning and strongly supports Teagasc and the retail trade in its promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> As well as animal manure, other potential sources of organic based fertilisers are sewage and organic waste. IFI participated with a UK company in a feasibility study of the farm utilisation of dried sewage sludge in counties Meath and Louth in 1996-97. It necessitated the movement of bulky material with quite low nutrient concentrates large distances. IFI did not deem it to be a commercial proposition.</P>
    <P>IFI carried out a major feasibility examination of anaerobic digestion of waste materials in the 1996-98 period. It was concluded that the investment was not warranted due to the high cost of transporting the relatively low concentration residual liquid to farms and the cost of its application to the soil. The combination of income from &ldquo;gate&rdquo; fees for waste removal, as well as income from the biogas yield and from the value of the residual liquid to farmers did not seem to be sufficient to make the project viable.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> I am informed by IDA Ireland that there has been a significant downturn in the number of itinerary visits to the east region in 2001. However, the projects which were forthcoming from the recent successful itinerary visits and which are now established in the Navan Business Park are evidence of IDA Ireland's commitment to the Navan area. These include the CNH Information Technology Centre which employs 64 people and plans to create 240 jobs over the next four years; Europe Assistance Holidays has been actively recruiting over the last few months and now employs approximately 80 people in a call centre and administration functions; Generali International, an Italian insurance company, currently employs 24 people; Plaut, a German software company, employs 21 people and plans to increase its workforce to 45 over the next four years; Pemstar has recruited 22 people in recent months and Welch Allyn Medical Devices has doubled its workforce to 50 people in the past 18 months and has also broadened its activities in Navan to include higher value customer support and product development work while maintaining the core manufacturing element of the business.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, IDA Ireland is continuing to develop the Navan Business Park. A 25,000 square foot advance factory has been designed and planning permission sought. The agency has also accepted proposals from a local consortium for the redevelopment of Athlumney House for 6,000 square foot of office, educational and administrative space, as well as 10,000 square feet of office space in the courtyard, for which a planning permission application has been lodged with Meath County Council.</P>
    <P>As part of the Enterprise Ireland strategy for developing the regions, the agency maintains a profile of the infrastructure and facilities available in each region. The Navan Business Park is included in the Navan profile as a quality environment for modern industry and would be brought to the attention of any indigenous companies wishing to expand outside of Dublin city. However, there are currently no Enterprise Ireland companies located in the Navan Business Park.</P>
    <P>In relation to my overseas visits, these involve the promotion of Ireland Inc. as an attractive location for inward investment and not specific individual locations, such as the Navan Business Park. Moreover, such visits are generally organised by Enterprise Ireland for the purpose of promoting trade between Irish companies and new markets overseas. In general, it is the companies themselves which would be participants in a trade mission rather than the business park as an entity. However, Enterprise Ireland canvasses widely prior to any planned trade missions and should the Navan Business Park wish to participate, there should not be any difficulty in arranging that with Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will continue to promote <Col N="766" /> Navan as a location for suitable inward investment and indigenous projects.</P>

The terms of reference of the group were to agree with the social partners and the Departments of Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs the method of implementation of Council Directive 97/81/EC of 15 December 1997 concerning the Framework Agreement on Part-Time work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and ETUC.</P>
    <P>Following a Government decision of 21 July 1999, the Interdepartmental/Agency Review Group on Public Safety was established in November 1999. The terms of reference of the group were to examine and report on the adequacy of the current administrative and regulatory arrangements for general public safety &ndash; and if necessary to invite submissions on the matter; in so doing to carry out an audit of existing legislative and voluntary approaches to public safety issues, the extent of the cover and protection provided by those approaches, identify and comment upon any gaps in the existing arrangements and whether any changes, legislative or otherwise are needed; to make recommendations to the Government on any issues arising from the review, including the appropriateness of establishing a national co-ordination committee to direct and oversee the policy approach in this area; to cost the financial implications of its recommendations and suggest sources of funding to finance those recommendations; and a final report to be submitted to the Government no later than six months from the date of the first meeting of the group, or by such other deadline as may be agreed between the chairperson of the group and the Tánaiste.</P>

    <P>The Asia Strategy Group was established in October 1998 under the auspices of the foreign earnings committee. Its terms of reference were to consider how best to increase trade and investment between Ireland and Asia. The group's report was submitted to, and approved by, the Government in July 1999. A committee to oversee the implementation of the strategy was established, as set out in the report.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental and agency group was established on foot of a Government decision, in February 1998, that Ireland should participate in EXPO 2000. The group was formed on a non-statutory basis as an oversight committee to input on a broad range of issues relevant to Ireland's participation in EXPO. The group held its inaugural meeting on 7 May 1998 and its activities ceased at the end of 2000 following the end of EXPO 2000. The group did not have terms of reference and it was not intended that it would report on its activities.</P>
    <P>The Consumer Advisory Council is a special committee set up by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with special responsibility for Labour Affairs, Consumer Rights and International Trade, Deputy Kitt, on 29 June 2001. It is a formal mechanism for consulting consumer interests, for discussing issues and concerns of consumers, with a wide range of interested bodies, and feeding these views into the policy-making process. It has not reported.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board was re-established in September 1998. Its terms of reference are the provision of advice and-or recommendations to the Minister on factors affecting the cost of motor insurance and on any matter he may refer to the board or on any matters which the board itself sees as affecting premiums charged or the methods of providing motor insurance; evaluation on a six monthly basis of trends in and underlying factors contributing to motor insurance costs using available accident and claims data, consumer price indicators and other relevant factors; and the submission of an annual report to the Minister incorporating the board's findings, recommendations, advices and the results of a comparative survey at domestic and EU level in selected motor insurance categories.

    <P>An interdepartmental implementation group on the establishment of a personal injuries assessment board was set up in April 2001. Its job is to progress the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board, with an initial mandate to address personal injury claims arising from employers' liability insurance. The group expects to report by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I established the Review Group on Auditing in February 2000 following from the first report of the Committee of Public Accounts parliamentary inquiry into DIRT. Its terms of reference were to <Col N="769" /> establish whether self-regulation in the auditing profession is working effectively and consistently; whether new or revised structures and arrangements are necessary to improve public confidence, and if so, what form should they take; the role of the external auditor in providing other services to the same institution; the impact of other functions such as tax advice and consultancy on the external audit process; the determination of fees, bearing in mind shareholder interests; the relationships between an external auditor and the management that appoints and remunerates him; the statutory provisions on auditing in the Companies Acts and related codes; the role of the external auditor in ensuring compliance with statutory provisions; the possible role of the Central Bank in regard to management letters issued by external auditors to financial institutions; the possible strengthening of audit standards relating to financial institutions; the suitability of having joint auditors to financial institutions with one being appointed by the Central Bank; the possible introduction of maximum terms of five years for an auditor to a financial institution; and any matters directly related to the foregoing.</P>
    <P>The review group, which was chaired by Senator O'Toole, presented its report to the public accounts committee on the 11 July 2000. The Government subsequently endorsed the report and its recommendations.</P>
    <P>In April of this year I appointed the interim board of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, as recommended in the report in the Review Group on Auditing. The interim board of IAASA was set up on an interim basis pending the enactment of necessary legislation to establish the IAASA on statutory basis. Once this legislation is enacted IAASA will be responsible for supervising the regulation by the accountancy bodies of their members' professional standards.</P>
    <P>The role of the interim board of IAASA is to advise me and my Department during the drafting of the legislation necessary to give effect to the recommendations in the review group on auditing; and draw up a work programme to cover the operation of IAASA once established on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The interim board has now provided me with its views on the approach I plan to take on the legislation to implement the recommendations contained in the Report of the Review Group on Auditing and I intend to bring proposals to Government in the near future to seek its approval to get a Bill drafted.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Working Group on Company Law Compliance and Enforcement, on foot of a decision by the Government, was announced on 7 August 1998. The group's terms of reference were to review the compliance arrangements and enforcement regimes for company law; to consider the respective roles for the parties responsible for compliance and enforcement, particularly the courts, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Director <Col N="770" /> of Public Prosecutions and the Registrar of Companies; to identify and evaluate the legislative, organisational and resource issues affecting compliance and enforcement; to make appropriate recommendations to address these issues; to examine and identify the resources and structures necessary to achieve a more frequent updating of companies legislation; to identify the cost and benefits involved in implementing its recommendations; and to report to the Tánaiste and to the Minister for Science, Technology and Commerce by 30 November 1998.</P>
    <P>The working group, which was chaired by Mr. Michael McDowell, SC, now Attorney General, reported on 30 November 1998.</P>
    <P>In February 2000, I set up the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, a group charged with developing proposals for the review and reform of company law. The group has been set up on an interim basis pending its being given a statutory existence on foot of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001. Part 7 of this Act provides for the functions of the group and was brought into effect under SI.438. I am in the process of appointing the group on a statutory basis under Part 7 of the Act. The group is required to report at two yearly intervals and its first report is expected at the end of the year 2001.</P>
    <P>The Report on E Commerce &ndash; The Policy Requirements, was published in July 1999, by Forfás at my request. The Implementation Group on the Forfás Report was set up in October 1999, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report. The group has not published a progress report yet.</P>
    <P>The eWork Action Forum was established to provide a focal point for the ongoing development of an environment which will stimulate telework-ework employment opportunities and ensure that this method of working achieves its full potential in contributing to economic growth and an improved quality of life. The forum was established on a non-statutory basis and it is not intended to establish it on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the forum are to monitor and evaluate progress in developing an environment in which teleworking can flourish; to monitor and evaluate progress in implementing the recommendations of the report of the NACT and refine recommendations if appropriate; to update and promote the code of practice on teleworking in conjunction with the social partners; to monitor legislation in the context of its impact on teleworking; to recommend and encourage relevant research; to gather relevant statistics and write reports; and to present an annual report to the Oireachtas each year.</P>

    <P>The eEurope 2002 Action Plan, was agreed by the European Council at Feira in June, 2000. The aim of the action plan is to increase Europe's competitiveness by exploiting the opportunities <Col N="771" /> of the new digital economy and in particular the Internet.</P>

    <P>The Expert Group on Future Skill Needs was set up by the Government &ndash; the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Science &ndash; in late 1997 as part of the business, education and training partnership. The objectives of the expert group are to identify, in a systematic way, the skills needs of different sectors and to advise on the actions needed to address them; to develop estimating techniques that will assist in anticipating the future; to advise on the promotion of education-continuous training links with business at national and local levels; to consider strategic issues in developing partnerships between business and the education-continuous training sectors in meeting the skills needs of business; and to advise on how to improve the awareness of job seekers of sectors where there are demands for skills, of the qualifications required, and of how they can be obtained.</P>

    <P>The PPF contains a commitment to review the underlying methodology and existing targets of the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, and to consider new targets in consultation with the social partners. The NAPS Employment-Unemployment Committee was established in February 2001 and completed its report in July 2001. Its terms of reference were as follows: low paid employment &ndash; to assess and make recommendations from the NAPS perspective on how best to improve progression prospects at the lower end of the employment scale, having regard to work being carried out by the lifelong learning task force the priority accorded to adult learning in the Department of Education and Science, and to the outcome of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs Employability Study and other relevant information; disincentives to employment and training &ndash; to examine the extent to which there may still be disincentives to employment and training, including secondary benefits, having regard to work already carried out, and to make recommendations; and cross cutting issues &ndash; to address the cross cutting poverty issues relating to children, women, older people, and ethnic minorities as an emerging cause of poverty, to the extent that such are considered by the working group to be germane to the above mentioned issues relating to low paid employment and secondary benefits.</P>
    <P>The Social Economy National Monitoring Committee under the chair of this Department was set up in late 1999 in accordance with the Government decision to introduce a dedicated social economy programme.</P>

It is a non-statutory committee and has agreed its own rules of procedure in accordance with ESF Regulations and the CIP as agreed with the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>A Task Force on Lifelong Learning was established in February 2000, in collaboration with the Department of Education and Science, as provided for under Framework IV of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The task force had its first meeting on 18 February 2000. The key steps to be followed by the task force were to identify existing lifelong learning providers and programme provision; to map existing provision in terms of its adequacy or cover; and to identify, <Col N="774" /> propose and cost priority actions on lifelong learning, based on expanding or modifying existing provision or the development of new initiatives, with particular reference to the achievement of the objectives set out in the programme and to the identification and resolution of implementation issues arising. The work of the task force is still ongoing.</P>
    <P>A mainstreaming forum to capture, disseminate and build upon the outcomes of the employment initiative was established in November 1998. The work of the forum concluded in the first quarter of 2000. No report was issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 to 70, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The case to which the Deputy refers was taken independently by Coillte Teoranta to the EU Court of First Instance on the basis of the direct and individual concern to the company of the European Commission's decision to disallow forestry premium payments made by the State to Coillte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="782" /> As the Deputy is aware, Ireland, in separate proceedings, has lodged with the European Court of Justice a challenge to the European Commission's decision. I am advised not to comment on this matter as it is <i>sub judice</i>.</P>
    <P>The State, having the right to do so and considering that it was in Ireland's interests, applied to intervene in the case taken by Coillte. Neither the Commission nor Coillte had any objection to this application. The EU Court of First Instance, under its rules of procedure, considered whether Coillte had the necessary standing to bring the proceedings but ruled that the application was inadmissible. In summary, what was decided by the European Court of First Instance was that Coillte was precluded from taking an independent case as it did not have standing before the court on that issue. This decision has no effect on the case taken before the European Court of Justice on behalf of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I understand from Coillte that the decision of the Court of First Instance was not received by the company in time to be included in the annual report for 2000. In any event as will be clear from the above, the substantive issue, which is Ireland's challenge to the European Commission's decision, has not yet been adjudicated on.</P>
    <P>As regards costs, the order of the Court of First Instance provides that Coillte shall pay the costs of the Commission. To date, the Commission has not sought to pursue to the question of costs. The legal costs incurred by Coillte are a matter for the company. The State will be requested to meet its own costs, details of which are not yet available.</P>
    <P>With regard to Coillte's annual report, it is not required of the company to submit a draft of the document in advance of its publication, nor has it been the practice of the company so to do. I am satisfied with the manner in which Coillte fulfils its reporting requirements to me and with the way in which the company's annual reports are presented.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, while the case taken by Coillte to the Court of First Instance does not affect Ireland's ongoing challenge to the Commission, I am, nevertheless, being kept fully informed of all developments.</P>

      <QRef>[24433/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the humanitarian situation in Iraq. Ireland, as a member of the UN Security Council, is committed to reform of the sanctions so as to eliminate the suffering caused to the people of Iraq. The reason sanctions remain in place is Iraq's rejection of the Security Council demands that it allow UN arms inspectors to verify that it is not engaged in the production of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. It refuses to comply with UN Resolution 1284, adopted in December 1999, which established a new arms inspection body, the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission &ndash; UNMOVIC &ndash; and provided for the suspension of UN sanctions if the Government allowed arms inspections to be renewed.</P>
      <P>The oil for food programme was established by a memorandum of agreement between the UN and the Government of Iraq in 1996 to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people in the context of the UN economic sanctions regime introduced in 1990. Administered by the United Nations Office for Iraq Programme &ndash; UNOIP, the oil for food programme is the co-ordinating mechanism for meeting the humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq. The question does not, therefore, arise whether Ireland should establish humanitarian delegations in Iraq to oversee the oil for food programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my recent visit to the UN, I held discussions on 1 October with the head of the UNOIP, Mr. Benan Sevan. Mr. Sevan had completed work on a further report from the UN Secretary General on the humanitarian situation in Iraq. This report was discussed in the Security Council on 11 October, under Ireland's chairmanship. The report provides a detailed and objective analysis of the operation of the oil for food programme over the past three months. The Secretary General's report has made it abundantly clear that, through the programme, the Government of Iraq is in a position to address fully the nutritional and health requirements of its people, particularly children. That Iraq has deliberately <Col N="784" /> failed to co-operate with the UN to fulfil those needs is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In the view of the Government, the UN humanitarian programme in Iraq is in the best position to verify that food, medical facilities and medical attention are available to all children and to accurately determine the factual position regarding children's health. From my discussions with Mr. Sevan and others closely involved with the situation in Iraq, I am satisfied at the manner in which the Office for Iraq Programme is carrying out that task and with the integrity shown by its staff under very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>Given the UN assurance that the necessary funding is available, it is the Government of Iraq's own responsibility to ensure that the nutritional and health needs of its children are met. Under its agreement with the UN, it is Iraq's responsibility to draw up the sectoral distribution plan and to revise the distribution plan allocations. It is Iraq's responsibility to place the orders, to authorise the necessary credit and to arrange for the normal dispatch of supplies. However, the Secretary General reports that Iraq has made preparation of the distribution plan unnecessarily cumbersome, that it has declined to revise the distribution plan allocations, that it is responsible for slow contracting for essential supplies and has created considerable delays in the opening of letters of credit. Indeed, during the first half of 2001 not a single order was placed by Iraq for medicines.</P>
    <P>Ireland urges Iraq to co-operate honestly and effectively with the UN humanitarian programme and to look after the interests of its own people. At the same time, Ireland is working in the current negotiations in the Security Council to revise the sanctions to achieve a resolution which will help to alleviate the humanitarian situation in Iraq by providing for the normal development of the Iraqi economy and convincing Iraq to accept fully its international obligations under the resolutions of the Security Council. These, when accepted, will result in the suspension of sanctions.</P>
    <P>Given the responsibility of the UN for the administration of the oil for food programme and the responsibility of the Iraqi Government in its implementation, it would not be appropriate for governments to send delegations to Iraq to oversee the programme.</P>

      <P>The international aid community, including Ireland, has been providing essential emergency relief to <Col N="785" /> Afghanistan for some time. In October 2000, Ireland Aid gave priority to Afghanistan as a then &ldquo;forgotten emergency&rdquo;. Earlier this year, a package of £1.2 million in humanitarian relief was provided. More recently, the Government announced a further £2.8 million in emergency assistance. A total of £4 million has thus been provided for Afghanistan since the start of this year. This aid is aimed at both the vulnerable population within Afghanistan and at meeting the needs of refugees who flee across its borders into Pakistan. The UNHCR is preparing, with Irish Government support, for 1.5 million new refugees. The NGOs are also catering for these two categories of people who are immediately at risk. The latest official package was disbursed quickly to the relevant Irish NGOs with which there is daily contact. Together we are making every appropriate effort to ensure that our assistance reaches those who need it most with maximum effect.</P>
      <P>The Government is working vigorously and proactively to help resolve the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and its impact on Pakistan. This is not only reflected in our working relationship with NGOs but also in the programme of work which Ireland is pursuing in its presidency of the Security Council. We are engaged in ongoing, intense consultations with the key humanitarian and other actors in both New York and Geneva and with those who are delivering aid to the people of Afghanistan with our support.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has established one special committee since 1997, details of which are set out below. While the Department has not established any task forces since 1997, it expects to be able to make an announcement on the establishment of the proposed task force on policy regarding emigrants in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of reference for the Ireland Aid programme review were approved by the Government on 13 December 2000 and the inaugural meeting of the review committee was held in February 2001. The terms of reference are as follows: to examine and assess the future role of Ireland Aid in responding to emergency humanitarian crises and in helping to advance objectives of poverty alleviation, sustainable development and the integration into the world economy of developing countries, particularly least developed countries and, at a multilateral level, through Ireland's role in the developing co-operation programmes and policies of the EU, the UN and relevant multilateral institutions generally; to consider ways of <Col N="786" /> enhancing and sustaining public ownership of the Irish Government programme; to review the role of the NCDE in development education and look at media strategies related to public ownership and awareness; to consider and recommend strategic priority policy areas, and geographical range, for future Ireland Aid participation, including in the areas of social and economic development, agriculture and rural development and the horizontal issues of human rights and good governance, gender equality, peace building and conflict prevention, environment, sustainable development generally, HIV-AIDS, and the involvement of civil society; to consider and assess the future role of Ireland Aid in helping to advance the integration of least developed countries into the world economy, including trade, investment, debt relief and the promotion of knowledge and capacity issues generally; to consider and assess the future role of Ireland Aid in advancing agreed international development goals and objectives, including issues of coherence, co-operation and complementarity in the context of wider Irish foreign policy concerns and in Ireland's relations with partner governments in developed and developing countries; to consider the policies, programmes and management arrangements of countries that have already achieved the target of 0.7% of GNP as development co-operation assistance; to consider and make recommendations on future management and structures, including staffing requirements, of Ireland Aid and its agencies such as APSO, bearing in mind the importance of democratic accountability and public ownership issues, its work with other Irish organisations involved in international development co-operation, general policy and programme orientations on the basis that development co-operation is an integral part of Ireland's international relations and an important instrument of foreign policy; and to issue a report on these matters within four months of the Government decision approving these terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The review is to be conducted by a committee to be appointed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in consultation with the Taoiseach and other Ministers and chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell. The committee will comprise individuals with appropriate expertise, experience and objectivity. Specifically, the committee will include individuals with (a) expertise and experience related to national development programmes, for example, in the fields of economic and social analysis, public administration and management; (b) practical knowledge of conditions in developing countries; and (c) familiarity with the intergovernmental aspects of aid management. The overall objective being to facilitate innovative approaches and ensure coherence across a range of Government policy as it relates to ODA.</P>
    <P>The review committee is to work in close co-operation with the Department of Foreign <Col N="787" /> Affairs and other Departments as necessary, including in the context of the existing interdepartmental committee &ndash; IDC &ndash; on development co-operation. The review committee is to,<i> inter alia</i>, have regard to the following reports &ndash; the OECD peer review of Ireland's aid policy and programme, commissioned studies by Fitzpatrick Associates of possible policy initiatives in the context of an expanding budget, the SMI related review of the management arrangements for the Irish Aid programme which was overseen by a steering committee representative of the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs, the Irish aid advisory committee and OECD secretariat. A dedicated secretariat to report to the chair of the review committee will be provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The review will involve, <i>inter alia</i>, and as necessary, consultations with the Irish Aid Advisory Committee, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, independent experts in the field of development co-operation, APSO, the NCDE, organisations in receipt of funding from Ireland Aid, representatives of developing countries, EU member states and the Commission, international organisations and other organisations or persons the review committee deems may be of assistance in its work. It is expected that the committee will report in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>Ireland is an IEA member state and participates fully in the IEA's programmes, deliberations and conclusions, including those relating to projected long-term developments in the energy sector. In addition, the European Commission published towards the end of last year a Green Paper entitled, Towards a European Strategy for the Security of Energy Supply, with a view to stimulating debate on the principal issues which can be identified relating to security of energy supply in the European Union. The European Council gave preliminary consideration to the Green Paper in May 2001 and instructed the Commission to continue the consultation process. The Green Paper will be considered again at the December meeting of the Council. In the circumstances, I have no plans to duplicate the work of the IEA and the EU by commissioning the kind of study mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the impact of leased line provision on regional development, telecommunications infrastructure is just one of a range of factors influencing regional development.

    <P>The Communications (Regulation) Bill is currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. The Bill sets out reforms of the regulatory framework for the sector in order to stimulate further competition in the provision of electronic communications networks and services by the industry.

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 2000, the Government approved, in principle, the development of the metro system for Dublin on a public-private partnership &ndash; PPP &ndash; basis. Immediately following this decision, I asked the light rail project office &ndash; LRPO &ndash; of CIE to commence the necessary preparatory work and report progress to me on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Since then, the LRPO has undertaken a preliminary public consultation exercise in relation to development of the system. Studies are also taking place at present into possible route alignments and traffic modelling so that clarity can be provided to the private sector when procurement commences. These studies will be completed in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>In addition, a market consultation exercise, conducted by my Department, invited interested parties to comment on proposals for the development of the metro. A significant level of response was received from major companies both in Ireland and across the world. An analysis of the responses has taken place and this will assist with the preparation of procurement documentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure that the delivery of the metro has the necessary focus, I propose to establish a statutory, independent, commercial, State body &ndash; the <Col N="790" /> Railway Procurement Agency &ndash; which will be given responsibility for procuring the new system. The Bill providing for the establishment of the agency has passed all stages in the Seanad and will be introduced in the Dáil in the near future. In the meantime, in order to allow the preparatory work to continue, I have appointed an interim Railway Procurement Agency to take a preliminary position on the procurement process pending enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will be bringing specific proposals on the metro development to Government in the coming weeks, with a view to commencing the procurement process before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Work on the construction of the Luas system is continuing with the line from Tallaght to Connolly Station on target for completion in October 2003 and the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line due for completion in December 2003. Passenger services on both lines will commence shortly after construction has been completed. Most of the enabling contracts on the lines have been awarded and some have already been completed. The main construction contract, involving track laying and cabling, was signed recently and work has begun.</P>
      <P>The construction of the depot at Red Cow was completed in July last and is being fitted-out at present while construction of the Sandyford depot will commence in the next few weeks. The first tram will arrive in Dublin before the end of this month and the remainder of the 40 trams ordered will be delivered at the rate of two per month thereafter. The competition for the selection of the operator of the system is progressing and the preferred candidate is likely to be selected by the end of this year.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>if, in view of the increasing concern along the east coast, particularly in County Louth, of a terrorist attack on Sellafield, she will continue the emergency plans in such circumstances.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>Concern about terrorist attacks on Sellafield or other nuclear plants has raised public concern about our preparedness to deal with the consequences of a nuclear incident. My Department, in conjunction with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &ndash; RPII has primary responsibility for emergency planning for nuclear accidents. A national emergency plan for such accidents is in place to ensure a rapid and effective response to accidents involving the release, or potential release, of radioactive substances into the environment, which could result in exposure of the public to radiation. The plan is designed to cater for a major disaster at a nuclear installation in another country, which would result in radioactive contamination reaching Ireland.</P>
      <P>My Department has overall responsibility for ensuring the co-ordination of the roles and functions of the relevant Departments and statutory organisations. These have responsibilities under the plan to establish procedures and implement measures within their own particular fields of competence, including integration, where appropriate, with emergency services already provided for other civil emergencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current plan, published in 1992, has been undergoing review and testing for the past two years, and an updated plan will be ready for pub<Col N="796" /> lication towards the end of the year. The changes in the plan are largely institutional in nature, and are designed to streamline administrative arrangements, and to reflect advances in science, technology and meteorology. They are designed to ensure prompt and effective analysis of any emergency, and prompt communications to the public and to key players concerning risk analysis and recommended counter measures.</P>
    <P>The plan has been the subject of independent evaluation, and a full-scale exercise of the plan will take place early next month. The exercise, based on a simulated accident abroad, has been planned within the Department, in conjunction with other Departments, for two years. It has been worked on intensively for the past 12 months, and independent consultants were brought in to advise on the most appropriate and user friendly plan. I intend to publish the updated plan in the near future, and to deliver a fact sheet drawn from the plan to every household in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>While epidemiology is primarily a matter for the Department of Health and Children, my Department closely monitors all developments and published research in this area. Before an excess risk of cancer can be attri<Col N="797" /> buted to a particular cause, such as living near the Welsh coast, it would be important to assess the incidence of specific types of cancer and make due allowance for the environmental agents to which the population may have been exposed over the 30 to 40 year latent period associated with most cancers.</P>
      <P>In Ireland the most common cancer is NMS &ndash; non-melanoma skin cancer &ndash; and accounts for one third of all cancers. For males and females there is a significantly above average incidence in counties Kerry and Wicklow, while there is a significantly below average incidence in counties Wexford and Mayo, according to the &ldquo;Cancer in Ireland, 1994&rdquo; report. A study of the incidence of childhood leukaemia over the period 1974-1983, commissioned by the Department of Health and published in December 1986, showed that the average annual incidence rate in Ireland of 31 per million children was similar to that in other western populations. No excess of mortality or incidence was apparent on either the east or south coasts of the country.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware the study referred to in the question has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. The RPII monitors low level radiation exposure of the public in Ireland. The National Cancer Registry Board monitors the incidence of cancer by type and by geographical distribution. No association between exposure and cancer distribution has been observed.</P>

      <P>The national development plan was embarked upon by the Government to redress the lack of investment in infrastructure generally within the State down the years. In excess of £1 billion &ndash; 1.27 billion &ndash; is being invested in the railways and light rail to increase the overall <Col N="798" /> capacity of both the suburban and main line systems and to encourage a modal shift, particularly in urban areas, to public transport generally.</P>
      <P>However, I am fully aware that significant infrastructural deficiencies still remain to be tackled to improve the service quality for users. I do not accept that a comparison between the usage of railway systems in Switzerland and Germany is directly relevant to Irish conditions. I am, however, encouraged by the fact that the number of passengers using the rail network continues to grow year on year.</P>

      <P>The issue of rural public transport is one in which I have a particular interest and this is why I arranged for a provision of £3.5 million to be included in the national development plan for the funding of pilot rural public transport projects.</P>
      <P>On 2 July last I launched the rural transport initiative &ndash; RTI &ndash; which aims to promote and support the development of innovative, community-based pilot public transport projects in rural areas. Area Development Management Limited &ndash; ADM &ndash; is administering this initiative on behalf of my Department.</P>
      <P>The initiative was widely publicised earlier in the year through the issuing of a consultation document on the subject. The closing date for applications was 17 September last and the proposals received are now being assessed in line with the eligibility and other criteria governing it. The RTI is one of a number of pilot developments being taken to address the issue of public transport in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conjunction with my Department, the directors of community and enterprise of each county are engaged in drawing up an audit of public <Col N="799" /> transport services and needs throughout the country, including Fingal. This audit has already been piloted in four counties &ndash; Kerry, Mayo, Laois and Westmeath &ndash; with a view to bringing that experience to bear in the auditing of the other counties. It is hoped to have the work completed by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, a new interdepartmental committee, chaired by an official of my Department, was established recently to bring forward recommendations for a rural public transport policy. Among other things, the committee will draw on the experience gained from the pilot projects under the rural transport initiative and will take on board the results of the county audits in completing its work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>My immediate target, as announced in the Green Paper on sustainable energy, is to add an additional 500 MW of renewable energy based electricity capacity to the network by 2005. This target will be achieved under support measures administered by my Department's alternative energy requirement programme &ndash; AER &ndash; and by activity in the liberalised green electricity market. Towards this end I have announced AER V which involves the largest ever call for proposals to build, own and operate renewable energy based electricity generating stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that local communities have an opportunity to participate in the programme. I, therefore, decided to reduce the previous five MW cap in the small scale wind category to three MW. I also decided that devel<Col N="800" /> opers in the large scale category should be excluded from participation in the small scale category. This balanced approach will ensure accelerated development of the sector while ensuring communities can participate in the programme without imposing a potentially disproportionate additional cost on electricity consumers.</P>
    <P>Net metering on the other hand raises issues relating to a realistic price, appropriate connections and metering. In this regard the renewable energy strategy group report &ldquo;Strategy for Intensifying Wind Energy Deployment&rdquo; in addressing net metering concluded that &ldquo;small renewable energy systems produce relatively expensive electricity such that even though they are replacing electricity otherwise bought at the retail rate, the economics are often still marginal&rdquo;. I will review community participation in this programme in the light of community involvement in the AER V support measure which is out to tender at this time.</P>

      <P>On the future of Aer Rianta, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 34 tabled by Deputy Stagg which I answered earlier. Aer Rianta's proposals in relation to the three State airports are in the first instance a matter for Aer Rianta, which has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the airports and to provide such facilities and services as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers.</P>
      <P>My Department has already asked Aer Rianta for a considered view on the implications of the Aviation Regulator's recent determination of maximum airport charges for the future development of the company. The Deputy will be aware that Aer Rianta has decided to seek a judicial review of the regulator's determination. Further comment on the future development of the three State airports would be speculative and premature at this stage.</P>

      <P>As a member of the International Energy Agency &ndash; IEA &ndash; Ireland is obliged to maintain oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of net imports, and the EU imposes a similar requirement based on consumption. On 1 October 2001, Ireland's oil stocks were estimated to be 106 days under the IEA system. These stocks comprise company and consumer operational stocks together with strategic stocks held by the National Oil Reserves Agency &ndash; NORA.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the level of stocks held by Ireland, together with the mechanisms which exist at both the IEA and national levels for dealing with oil supply shortages, are sufficient to minimise the adverse impact on this country of any interruption in normal supply arrangements. I am informed by the ESB that its policy is to hold about nine weeks of coal stocks at Moneypoint.</P>

      <P>Other than departmental committees which are established on an ongoing basis, the following task forces and special committees have been set up in my Department since 1997. The naval and air services consultation group was established in November, 1998 on foot of the special studies of the Air Corps and Naval Service conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers consultants. The group's remit was to provide inputs to the naval and air services planning process which culminated with the completion of the naval service implementation plan and the air corps implementation plan. Following the completion of its work, the group was disbanded in June 2001. In September 2001, the Naval Service joint implementation team was established to oversee the implementation of the Naval Service implementation plan. It is envisaged that the team will report progress in due course.</P>

    <P>Arising from the report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore in 1999 a working group, comprising representatives from both the civilian and military branches of my Department and from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, was established in September 2000 to monitor progress in regard <Col N="804" /> to the implementation of the safety recommendations set out in that report. The work of this group is ongoing and regular progress reports are made.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental defence and security environment assessment group was established in February 2000 to ensure the Government is kept up to date on the implications for defence and the Defence Forces of developments in the defence and security environment. The group has representatives from the civil and military branches of my Department and from the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>In August 2001, a special steering group, comprising members of the Defence Forces and civilian experts, was established to study the nature and extent of bullying &ndash; sexual harassment in the Defence Forces, to review existing policies and procedures, to make recommendations on strategies and programmes of awareness and education in the area. The group is expected to report next year.</P>
    <P>In July, 1998 the Government approved the appointment of an interdepartmental task force on the future management and development of the Curragh of Kildare. In addition to officials of the Department of Defence, both civilian and military, the following Departments-State agencies were represented: Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Department of the Environment and Local Government, Department of Finance, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Kildare County Council and Midlands East Regional Tourism Authority.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the task force were to make recommendations as to the most appropriate Department or State agency to have overall responsibility for the Curragh having regard to its significant archaeological, cultural, environmental and historical importance; to examine and report on the existing situation with regard to the use and management of the Curragh; to make recommendations on the future control, management and staffing structure which requires to be put in place to ensure the effective operation and preservation of the area into the next millennium; to examine and report on existing legislation governing the use of the area and to make recommendations with regard to future legislative requirements; to consider and report on the possibility of the region being developed as a leisure and amenity area with greater public access; to seek submissions from all interested parties, both statutory and non-statutory including the relevant local authority, Kildare County Council; and to examine and report on the existing prison facility with a view to its expansion to meet accommodation demands. The task force's report was presented in June 1999. The report, while not published, was made available to the public in May 2000.</P>

      <P>In regard to the 2000 ewe premium-rural world premium scheme, the position is that all payments under the ewe premium, as stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 301 of 3 October, were made to the person named in two instalments in June 2000 and February 2001. As there is no record of receipt in my Department of an area aid application for that year nor a certificate of posting for same he did not qualify for payment of the rural world premium.</P>

      <P>A condition of the 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme is that applicants must meet a minimum stocking level of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare in the year preceding application. However, farmers who are unable to meet that minimum stocking density but who traditionally qualified for headage grants in respect of cattle and/or sheep may continue to qualify for payment, provided their land is being utilised and is not in danger of undergrazing. The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000 and, according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum stocking density. My Department will be in contact with the person named shortly with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A decision on entitlement to area based compensatory allowance will then be made.</P>

It reported to the North-South Ministerial Council on 4 April 2001.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of this committee are as follows:</P>
    <P>The scope of the work of the action team was to consider how best the Border Corridor Groups could contribute to decisions on spending from the new round of EU Structural Funds support in the Border Corridor, in particular the Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG IIIA CIP and the cross-border components of the Peace II Programme.</P>
    <P>In this context, the action team was to consider the following: maximising the role of the groups to bring practical benefits to the communities on both sides of the Border; the potential for a performance indicator which will optimise the outcome of spend on the Border corridor, regardless of spending authority; complementarity with existing structures North and South; complementarity of actions across related expenditure programmes, both EU and national; and linkages with other district councils-sectoral representatives within the eligible area for INTERREG III and Peace II.</P>
    <P>In carrying out this remit, the action team was to give due consideration to the following factors: the legal, operational competencies and remit of local authorities North and South; EU Structural Funds regulations; the role of the member states, Government Departments, Special EU Programmes Body and other delivery agents; accountability; efficiency and effectiveness; and transparency and inclusiveness in EU funds management and delivery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined my concerns regarding the issue of underage drinking and binge drinking on a number of occasions recently. The health promotion unit of my Department commissioned the first national lifestyle surveys, Survey of Lifestyle, Attitudes and Nutrition, SLÁN, and Health Behaviour in School Aged Children, HBSC. They provide a profile of health-related behaviours including current drinking patterns. The first report was published in 1999. Follow-up surveys will be conducted at regular intervals. The ESPAD survey, European Survey Project on Alcohol and Drugs, confirmed many of the findings of this national survey. For this reason, the health promotion unit has intensified work in this area and is involved in several measures which aim to tackle the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education programmes have been developed so that young people may be more informed and better equipped to make informed decisions when faced with the issue of alcohol. Children are <Col N="822" /> targeted through the substance misuse prevention programme called Walk Tall which was developed and delivered in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science and the health boards and, of course, the teachers. A total of 95% of primary schools have now received training in this programme. Adolescents are targeted through the substance abuse prevention programme, SAPP, called On My Own Two Feet, which forms part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. To date, two thirds of post primary schools have received training in this programme. The SAPP programme is also available for youth leaders working in local communities and at risk youth groups. Training is available for professionals and parents at community level through the regional health boards, with the purpose of helping long-term prevention of alcohol and drug misuse.</P>
    <P>A training initiative developed in association with the drinks industry on the responsible serving of alcohol, RSA, has been established. This is a training course for those in the pub trade and hospitality industry and was developed in co-operation with the drinks industry group and CERT. Some of the issues addressed in this programme are the prevention of serving those under age, those who are going to drink and drive and those who are already intoxicated.</P>
    <P>Research material is currently being finalised in relation to the impact of alcohol advertising on young people, the results of which are expected in the near future. This research will inform future policy in this area.</P>
    <P>As part of the Less is More alcohol awareness campaign, the health promotion unit of my Department held a special seminar which was attended by more than 100 stakeholders, health professionals, youth groups, teachers, parents, community groups, vintners and the Garda. At local level, the Department is working with youth leaders and health professionals in each of the health board areas to identify best practice initiatives within communities that promote awareness of alcohol to young people. Many of the health boards have already developed successful programmes to tackle some of the issues, and my Department will be supporting the continuation of these.</P>
    <P>Part of this campaign involved a phase which focused on those who buy or supply alcohol to those underage. It comprises of a poster which was displayed at alcohol outlets nationally and a series of radio messages. The theme is keeping children safe from drink and alerts people to their part in dealing with this problem. This phase coincided with the summer holiday season and exam results.</P>
    <P>Last week, I launched a Framework for Developing a College Alcohol Policy. This document provides the template to develop college alcohol policies which aim to curtail alcohol promotion practices and excessive drinking among students.</P>

As stated in the debate, under section 37, and the Fourth Schedule of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, the primary qualification required to qualify for internship in an Irish hospital must be obtained from an Irish university. Where a person does not hold such a primary qualification he or she cannot be granted the provisional registration which allows him or her carry out an internship in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department is currently carrying out a review of the Medical Practitioners Act. Consultations have been carried out with many interested groups, including the Irish Medical Council, the training bodies, bodies representing the medical professions and patients. I am already aware of the issue raised and it will be addressed as part of this review. It is hoped that draft heads of Bill will be published before the end of the year. However, I have asked my Department to examine whether any action can be taken to address this matter in the interim.</P>

      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, circulated all agencies on 18 June 1999 outlining the revised incremental credit arrangements for nurses. The document stipulated that incremental credit may be granted on permanent appointment in respect of all previous genuine nursing experience in Ireland and abroad. This provision was agreed with the Nursing Alliance on 3 November 1998 and took effect from that date. Prior to this, incremental credit on permanent appointment could only be granted in respect of previous nursing experience in the public health service and designated private hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was further agreed that whole-time temporary nurses may also be awarded incremental credit for previous genuine nursing experience, subject to appropriate validation. The incremental progression from the seventh to the maximum point of the salary scale was to be implemented on a phased basis; to the eight point in 1999, the ninth point in 2000, and the tenth point in 2001. The agreement came into effect on 1 January 1999. Since the person to whom the question relates is an employee of the North Western Health Board, I have asked the chief executive officer of that board to investigate the case and <Col N="826" /> to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to it.</P>

      <P>To address the prevalence of smoking in this country, the health promotion unit of my Department supports an extensive range of anti-smoking initiatives. In 2000, £1.34 million, 1.70 million, was spent by the unit on the development and implementation of anti-smoking campaigns by the health promotion unit. In 2001, £1.5 million, 1.90 million, has been allocated for anti-smoking campaigns.</P>
      <P>The current anti-smoking campaign, Break the Habit for Good, emphasises the positive effect quitting smoking can have on individuals and was launched in December 1998. The campaign involves national and local initiatives which offer support for those people wishing to give up smoking. The campaign was developed in conjunction with the Irish Cancer Society and the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further element of this campaign has been developed to target the growing numbers of <Col N="827" /> female teenagers who continue to take up smoking. While it is part of the Break the Habit for Good campaign, it is a specific initiative designed with a special focus. The campaign concentrates on issues which are more immediately important to young women such as their physical attributes. The simple message of this campaign is that smokers are less attractive, and it uses a range of anti-cosmetics presented by a character called NICO, who highlights the negative effects smoking can have on physical appearance, for example, yellowed teeth and wrinkled skin. The NICO campaign uses TV, radio and outdoor advertising to highlight the unappealing aspects of smoking. Both of these ongoing campaigns were used during 2000 and 2001.</P>
    <P>Following the ending of sponsorship of events and activities by tobacco companies last year, I provided funding for sponsorship of the Citywest Hotel Irish Masters Snooker Tournament in 2001 totalling £200,000. A similar amount will be provided in 2002 and 2003, subject to evaluation of the 2001 investment. Health sponsorship of this prestigious international event will further highlight the healthy anti-smoking message and promote a tobacco free society. The extensive television coverage of the event involving many well known young snooker stars brought home to viewers, especially young people, the positive aspects of not taking up smoking and of quitting smoking. The message is consistent with Government approved anti-tobacco health policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the advent of the general practitioner co-operative as a positive initiative in the area of primary care providing a new, quality based approach founded on co-operation and partnership between the stakeholders. It is an appropriate and structured response to meeting the needs of contemporary society. My Department is committed to this development and is happy to support health boards in their endeavours.</P>
      <P>The co-operatives operating at present are Caredoc in the South-Eastern Health Board area, NorthEast.Doc in the North-Eastern Health Board, K-Doc in the South-Western Area Health Board of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and NOW.Doc in the North-Western Health Board. In addition, a project is due to start this week in the Southern Health Board area which will cover west Cork and south Kerry.</P>
      <P>In 2001, all health boards were allocated moneys to explore the establishment of co-ops. Many health boards have recruited project managers to progress the concept within their area and a consultative process is taking place with interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two pilots, Caredoc and NorthEast.Doc are being independently evaluated. On receiving the first interim report of this evaluation, I said that I saw co-op models having a great deal to offer not only in terms of providing a specific general out of hours service but even more importantly in their potential for further development in terms of an expanded range of primary and community care services. The report, which <Col N="829" /> is available on my Department's web site &ndash; www.doh.ie &ndash; outlined structural and operational areas that need to be resolved before the co-op model could be rolled out nationally. For example, the report raised serious concerns regarding levels of out of hours claims by general practitioners in certain individual instances. In this regard it must be pointed out that the service which is being offered by these co-operatives is provided in a value for money framework and proper controls are put in place to monitor costs.</P>
    <P>In regard to the cost to the State in relation to these co-operatives, I presume the Deputy is referring to the additional costs involved in the operation of a region wide project which would be approximately £2.5 million per region. Certain other costs also arise, for example, the cost of the fees for general practitioners but these are already funded under the GMS scheme.</P>

      <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which came into effect on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives. The first is to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act and the second is to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from arrangements entered into under article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £90 or 114.28, £120 or 152.37 and £150 or 190.41 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high and maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health <Col N="830" /> boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review and the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>

      <P>Under the Local Government (Financial Provisions)(No. 2) Act, 1983, as amended, a local authority is empowered to charge for waste collection services provided by it or on its behalf and may, if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so on grounds of personal hardship, waive all or a portion of any such charge. My Department has no function in the administration of waste charges.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy statement on waste management, Changing our Ways, in line with EU policy recognises as fundamental to efficient waste management that all producers of waste pay fully for its collection, treatment and disposal. It specifically recommends that local authorities move rapidly towards full cost recoupment for waste services they provide, and that as a matter of equity and to incentivise waste reduction, the level of waste charges should vary according to usage.</P>
      <P>Under section 59 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, each local authority is responsible for the supervision of, and the enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the holding, recovery and disposal of waste within its functional area. Accordingly, it is a matter for each authority to deal with any illegal waste disposal activities taking place within its area. My Department has not been made aware of a problem of waste being hoarded by households.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 to 146, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, primary responsibility for the control of air pollution rests with local authorities. I am aware, from table 2.2 in the National Air Quality Monitoring Report &ndash; EPA 2000 &ndash; that Clare County Council operates three monitoring stations for smoke and sulphur dioxide in the county, and from table 5.4 in the &ldquo;Preliminary Assessment [of National Air Quality] under Article 5 of Council Directive 96/62/EC&rdquo;&ndash; EPA 2001 &ndash; that a total of four sites in the county are monitored for sulphur dioxide. Copies of these reports are in the Oireachtas Library. I am also aware that the county council carries out additional monitoring as occasion requires.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to determine the level of expenditure on individual local services as part of its annual estimates process. Such expenditure is funded from a variety of sources such as rates, fees, charges and the local government fund, which has increased substantially the level of resources available to local authorities for general purposes, including monitoring and control of air pollution, and investigating complaints about emissions to air.</P>
      <P>In recent years the funding that my Department has made available specifically to Clare County Council from the local government fund has been greatly increased. The general purpose allocation to council this year will be over £7.1 million which represents an increase of 23% over its allocation for 2000 and 45% over its 1999 baseline.</P>

      <P>Payments to the CIE Group for services provided under the free travel scheme are expected to amount to £31.82 million in 2001. This payment makes allowance for a discount of 40% to reflect the fact that service is not available generally to free travel passholders at peak hours in the major urban areas and that the scheme is utilising some spare off-peak capacity at lower marginal cost to the group. The internal apportionment of this amount between the three constituent companies &ndash; Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus &ndash; is a matter for CIE to determine.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 540,000 people with free travel passes. On the basis of this overall number, the payment to CIE is equivalent to approximately £59 a year per passholder under the scheme.</P>

      <P>Legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme <Col N="834" /> which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department allows health boards to make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments, ENPs. There is no automatic entitlement to an ENP. Payment of ENPs are made at the discretion of the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding individual cases.</P>
      <P>The principal consideration in paying an ENP to address a particular need is that the need is of an exceptional nature. Payments should arise only under abnormal conditions and should not become a regular or standard practice. The South Eastern Health Board was contacted on behalf of the person in question and has advised that her application for an ENP was refused by the community welfare officer on the grounds that the need was not of an exceptional nature. If the person in question is unhappy with the CWO's decision it is open to her to appeal the decision to the health board appeals officer.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that on 31 July 2001, I signed the Commencement Order giving effect to provisions in the Wildlife Amendment Act, 2000, which, <i>inter alia</i>, provides for the designation of natural heritage areas. Natural heritage areas were first proposed some years ago on a non-statutory basis. The criteria used in selecting sites are broadly similar to those that apply to SACs, but are not confined to a specified list of habitats and species. NHAs will conserve habitats and species listed in the Habitats Directive and additional habitats and species, of importance in the Irish context, as well as areas with a geological or geomorphological interest.</P>
      <P>Final designation of individual sites will take place only after the designation process is completed. The designation provisions are set out at sections 17 to 19 of the Wildlife Amendment Act. These provisions encompass public advertisement and broadcast of the intention to designate a site, publication of scientific advice, notification of land users and landowners, consultation with other Government Ministers and finally consultation with commissioners and planning authorities.</P>

      <P>My decisions on the ACCESS scheme were based on the recommendations made by the advisory committee, which evaluated all eligible applications. Unfortunately, on foot of this evaluation, the project referred to by the Deputy was not recommended by this committee and therefore was not included in the list of projects put before me for consideration. The funding available under ACCESS is £36 million. The scheme attracted great interest and was oversubscribed with 180 project promoters seeking grant aid in the order of £224 million. In these circumstances difficult decisions had to be taken and many worthwhile projects had to be omitted from the final list.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to claims of discrimination made under the Equal Status Act, 2000, by customers of public houses who may have been refused service. The Deputy will appreciate that I have no function in relation to the determination of individual claims of alleged discrimination lodged either under that Act or the Employment Equality Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>Under the equality legislation, there are two independent bodies with statutory roles, the Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations. The Equality Authority, which has the role of working towards the elimination of discrimination, provides information and advice to any person who feels he or she has been discriminated against on one or other of the nine grounds specified in the equality legislation, whether in an employment or non-employment area. Where a complaint of discrimination is lodged, the Director of Equality Investigations has the power under the Act to investigate and decide such a case. It is also open to the director to refer the matter for mediation.</P>
      <P>A decision in an individual case is a matter for the director to determine, or refer for mediation, having heard both sides of the case, having weighed up the evidence and having assessed if one or other of the permitted exemptions in the Act might apply. It would be inappropriate for me to comment either generally or on any particular case that might come before the director. However, section 22 of the Equal Status Act allows dismissal by the Director of Equality Investigations of a claim of alleged discrimination at any stage of the investigation, if the claim is made in bad faith or is frivolous or vexatious or relates to trivial matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>The principal legislative provisions relating to intoxicating liquor and persons under the age of 18 years are set out in Part IV of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, as amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000. In particular, section 31 of the 1988 Act provides that the holder of a licence shall not sell or deliver, or permit any person to sell or deliver, intoxicating liquor to a person under the age of 18 years. It also provides that a licensee who contravenes these provisions is guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>Section 40 of the 1988 Act provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may by regulations provide for the issue of an age card to those who have already attained 18 years of age and are, therefore, legally entitled to purchase or consume alcohol on a licensed premises. The national voluntary age card scheme which I introduced by way of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 (Age Card) Regulations, 1999, is designed to assist licensees in complying with the law. Its purpose is to provide evidence of age where a doubt exists. In any proceedings against a licensee for the sale of alcohol to an under-age person, it is a defence to prove that an age card was looked for and was produced. Neither the 1988 Act nor the 1999 regulations precludes the use of other forms of personal identification for proof of age purposes but I would encourage use of the age card wherever possible.</P>
      <P>It remains the law that a licensee may refuse admittance or service to a person or require a person to leave a licensed premises. For example, it is an offence to sell intoxicating liquor to a person who is drunk. On the other hand, actions by a licensee that are arbitrary or unreasonable may give rise to objections to renewal of the licence. Also, actions by the licensee that run counter to the provisions of the Equal Status Act, 2000 may be referred to the Director of Equality Investigations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have set out below the information sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Government approved the establishment of the committee to review the Offences Against the State Acts in July 1998. The terms of reference are to:</P>
      <P>examine all aspects of the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939-1998, taking into account: (a) the view of the participants to the multi-Party Negotiations that the development of a peaceful environment on the basis of the Agreement they reached on 10 April 1998 can and should mean a normalisation of security arrangements and practices; (b) the threat posed by international terrorism and organised crime; and (c) Ireland's obligations under international law; and to report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as soon as practicable with recommendations for reform.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference originally covered the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939-1985. The Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998, enacted after the Omagh bombing in August 1998, was subsequently added. The committee issued an interim report in June 2001 on the Special Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental working group on integration was established in November 1998 to formulate a strategy for implementing the Government's policy of responding positively to the needs of persons granted refugee status or leave to remain. The group's report was launched in February 2000. The terms of reference of the working group were to review the arrangements for integrating persons granted refugee status or permission to remain in Ireland, including the appropriate institutional structures for the delivery of these services and to make recommendations.</P>
      <P>The independent monitoring committee for the Refugee Legal Service was established in October 1999 to ensure that a quality refugee legal service is provided in accordance with the arrangement agreed between the Legal Aid Board and the Department and to investigate complaints from customers of the service. In accordance with their terms of reference, the monitoring committee is required to prepare an annual report to be submitted to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The report for 2000 is being finalised at present.</P>
      <P>A review group on investment-based naturalisation was established on 20 April 1998. The terms of reference were to review the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, to see how it might facilitate investment. The group reported in May 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> A Partnership 2000 expert working group on child care was established in 1997 and reported to Government in February 1999. The group was required to consider child care in the context of services provided by third parties for parents for the care of their children and on child care services caring for children aged 0 to 12 years, excluding residential care.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee on child care chaired by my Department was established in February 1999 to evaluate, cost and prioritise the recommendations of the reports of the Partnership 2000 expert working group on child care, the Commission on the Family and the National Forum on Early Childhood Education and an Action Programme for the Millennium. The committee concluded its work and submitted its report to Government in September 1999.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental child care synergies group chaired by my Department to focus on co-ordination and co-operation between Government Department and State agencies involved in funding child care was established in December 1999. This is a standing committee which has been established as part of the co-ordination structures for the delivery of child care services.</P>
    <P>A national co-ordinating child care committee to oversee the development of a child care infrastructure in an integrated manner throughout the country was established in December 1999. It is chaired by my Department and is a standing committee which has been established as part of the co-ordination structures for the delivery of child care services. The national co-ordinating childcare committee has established the following as part of its work: advisory group to proof the work of the committee for diversity of children's needs; certifying bodies sub-group to develop a national training framework for the child care sector; and a working group on school age child care to draft a report for the NCCC on school age child care provision. The working group is due to report in the near future.</P>
    <P>County child care committees to advance the provision of child care facilities within the local area were established during 2000 and 2001. The relevant health boards are assisting in the establishment of these committees. All of the county committees have now held their first meeting. The county child care committees are charged initially with developing a county child care plan which will form part of the ten year county development board plans. The county child care committees are standing committees and form part of the co-ordination structures for child care.</P>
    <P>A programme appraisal committee to evaluate assessments of applications for funding under the equal opportunities childcare programme, 2000-06, and make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in each case was established in July 2000. This committee <Col N="852" /> first met in July 2000 and is a standing committee as part of the funding structures for child care.</P>
    <P>The National Crime Forum was established in February 1998 to elicit the views of the public on crime and the criminal justice system. It held public sessions in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Sligo during 1998, and the report of the crime forum was published in December 1998.</P>
    <P>Following a commitment given by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Committee of Public Accounts in April 2001, a high level group, comprising representatives of all relevant agencies, was established in May 2001 to discuss the issues raised in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of December 2000 on the collection of fines. The terms of reference of the group are to achieve greater co-ordination between the relevant agencies on the issue and service of court summonses and the issue and execution of fine warrants; to examine the methods of enforcing fines; to consider other methods for dealing with wrong-doing currently the subject of fines, and to make recommendations. The group is due to report back to the Committee of Public Accounts before the end of October 2001.</P>
    <P>A committee to monitor the 3% quota for employment for people with disabilities in the public service was established in March 1999. The terms of reference are to monitor progress on the attainment of the 3% target in the public sector, which is a target set out in paragraph 5.21 of Partnership 2000. The work of this committee is ongoing.</P>
    <P>The Disability Forum, interdepartmental co-ordination committee on disability issues, was established on 4 August 2000. Its terms of reference are (1) to brief the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and equality on progress being made in each Department in the disability area and to identify problems; and (2) to facilitate the exchange of information issues, drafts on disability issues and bring about any necessary co-ordination. The work of the committee is ongoing and it meets twice yearly.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission of the Status of People with Disabilities was replaced by the National Disability Authority when the NDA Act, 1999, was enacted. The committee was established on 19 March 1997 to: (a) advise the interdepartmental task force on the prioritisation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities; (b) provide any assistance and support required by the task force to facilitate the preparation of the action plan on the rights of people with disabilities; (c) advise the Department, as required, on the drawing up of a detailed implementation of the commission's recommendations; (d) make proposals to the Department on the mechanisms for monitoring the implementation <Col N="853" /> of the commission's recommendations; and (e) monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which have been accepted by the Government. A progress report, Towards Equal Citizenship, was published in December 1999.</P>
    <P>The national steering committee on violence against women was established in December 1997 to provide a co-ordinated response for female victims of domestic violence, rape and sexual assault. The committee produced its first report in March 1999 and is currently working on the production of its second progress report. The work of the committee is ongoing.</P>
    <P>A working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation which had its first meeting on 14 April 2000 was established in accordance with commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to review and improve maternity protection legislation. The report of the group was published on 28 February 2001.</P>
    <P>On 28 February 2001 I launched the review of the Parental Leave Act, 1998. The working group, charged with carrying out the review of the operation of the Act, met for the first time on 22 March 2001. The review of the Act is a requirement under section 28 of the Parental Leave Act which provides for a review of its operation not earlier than two years and not later than three years after the commencement of the Act, that is, between 3 December 2000 and 3 December 2001. This requirement is incorporated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness which contains a commitment to carry out this review in 2001 in consultation with the social partners. The working group has yet to publish a report as the review is presently ongoing.</P>
    <P>A technical advisory committee was established in May 2000 to assist in the development of the equality for women measures of the regional operational programmes of the national development plan. The measures will fund initiatives in the following areas: (a) upskilling and retraining of women employees; (b) encouraging entrepreneurship and career development among women; (c) innovative projects for disadvantaged women and women over 50 years of age; (d) support for women in decision making; (e) gender proofing of personnel practices; (f) employer family friendly project and sharing of family responsibilities: and (g) a research and information campaign for &ldquo;return to work&rdquo; women.</P>
    <P>The work of this committee is ongoing and its terms of reference are: to advise the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to the equality for women measure in the social inclusion and childcare sub-programme of the regional operational programmes of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006; to advise on criteria and the processes by which projects should <Col N="854" /> be selected and assessed; to advise on regional factors to be taken into account; to advise on expenditure on technical assistance; to advise on research requirements in respect of equality for women for funding from this measure; to consider reports on the ongoing operation of the projects; and in the context of the mid-term review of the national development plan to advise on any new issues to be addressed.</P>
    <P>A project appraisal committee was established in April 2001 to consider project applications submitted under strands (a) to (d) of the equality for women measures and to submit recommendations for my approval. This committee assessed projects having regard to the extent to which proposals addressed the following matters: barriers to women's labour market participation, entrepreneurship or their participation in decision making fora and contribution to greater level of gender equality in the workplace, including in relation to narrowing of gender pay gaps; involve key partners relevant to the project in genuine partnership arrangements; potential for multiplier effects, including the transfer of learning to the mainstream; value for money; include a focus on women who experience multiple forms of discrimination, where appropriate; geographical, urban and rural spread of projects; impact on gender equality, poverty and rural development; projects providing education and training will also be required to assist participants to achieve national certification and, where possible, to support the development of lifelong learning.</P>
    <P>The committee submitted recommendations to me in June. I considered its recommendations and having regard to the funding available, I approved 49 projects for funding.</P>
    <P>My Department also chairs a new committee set up in January 2001 under the national development plan, the equal opportunities and social inclusion co-ordinating committee. This committee will act as an advisory committee to the NDP-CSF monitoring committee and has the objective of securing the maximum application of NDP commitments on gender equality, social inclusion and equal opportunities. The work of this committee is ongoing and its terms of reference are as follows: to report to each meeting of the national development plan-community support framework, NDP-CSF, monitoring committee on equal opportunities, particularly gender equality, and on social inclusion matters; to review the equal opportunities and social inclusion impacts across the NDP, particularly for measures which are not targeted at categories which experience inequality or social exclusion; to review the results of targeted measures for the relevant categories; to promote the implementation of a mainstream approach to equal opportunities, in particular gender equality and social inclusion across the NDP-CSF expenditure areas; to promote and advise on the co-ordination of <Col N="855" /> policy on equal opportunities, particularly gender equality and social inclusion across the NDP-CSF expenditure areas based on research or other findings; to identify best practice for the promotion of equal opportunities and social inclusion; to monitor gender balance on the monitoring committees and to assist in the promotion of gender balance on these committees over the lifetime of the national development plan; to offer general advice on the evaluation of equal opportunities and social inclusion outcomes and to monitor the implementation of evaluation recommendations in so far as they relate to equal opportunities and social inclusion; consistent with the arrangements set out in the CSF for the mid-term review, to contribute to the mid-term review of the NDP-CSF by providing advice for the managing authorities and monitoring committees in relation to equal opportunities and social inclusion and on the realisation of equality and social inclusion outcomes.</P>
    <P>On the PPF consultative group on male-female wage differentials, in accordance with a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my Department is convening a consultative group, including representation from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the social partners to consider the recommendations of the ESRI research, How Unequal, Men and Women in the Irish Labour Market, including the case for a sectoral analysis in both the public and private sectors and to develop proposals for action or actions to address issues identified in the report for consideration by Government. The consultative group held its first meeting in May 2001. The group selected the following areas for sectoral studies: IT, electrical and electronic, retail, food and local government. A request for tender to undertake this work issued in September 2001 and the tenders received will be assessed by a sub-committee of the consultative group.</P>
    <P>The gender equality monitoring committee, established on 10 June 1997, was set up to monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the second Commission on the Status of Women. The following are its terms of reference: to monitor gender equality in Ireland, in the light of the recommendations of the second Commission on the Status of Women and the actions agreed at the fourth World Conference on Women; to draw up and submit to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, from time to time, a report on progress in implementing the Beijing Platform for Action in a manner appropriate to Irish conditions; to make recommendations to Ministers to accelerate implementation of the recommendations of the second Commission on the Status of Women which have been accepted by Government or by Ministers and the Beijing Platform for Action, as <Col N="856" /> appropriate; and to serve as a forum for consultation.</P>
    <P>The gender equality monitoring committee considered that research should be commissioned, <i>inter alia</i>, into the development of mechanisms to monitor progress in achieving gender equality in Ireland. It was decided that the research project would include recommendations on how to implement outstanding areas of the second Commission on the Status of Women. The project would also include proposals for monitoring outstanding recommendations and for changing the monitoring process.</P>
    <P>Much had been achieved by the gender equality monitoring committee over the years. Three monitoring reports have been published &ndash; one in 1994, a second in 1996 and the third in 1999. These reports monitored the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women, indicating where progress was made and where obstacles to implementation occurred. However, the committee considered that the time had come to move forward into the future with a new agenda. The committee considered that the most efficient way to move forward was to draw up a national plan for women which would take up from the work of the second Commission on the Status of Women. New monitoring structures would be required for the national plan for women and the research would identify mechanisms to monitor progress in achieving gender equality. Accordingly, the gender equality monitoring committee held its final meeting on 28 November 2000 where Dr. Yvonne Galligan presented her report on the research, commissioned by the committee, on the development of mechanisms to monitor the achievement of gender equality in Ireland. Dr. Galligan's report was launched on 16 October 2001.</P>
    <P>A working group on gender and equality proofing was established in November 1998. Partnership 2000 provided for a commitment to strengthening administrative procedures for equality proofing in the context of the national anti-poverty strategy. A working group including representatives of the social partners was set up by my Department to examine how to proceed with the implementation of this commitment. Two research projects were commissioned, one relating to gender proofing in the context of the Structural Funds, 2000-06, and a second project on equality proofing. The gender proofing report was finalised by the working group in July 1999 and the equality proofing report was finalised in January 2000 and both reports were presented to Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>A firearms legislation review group was established in July 1998. Its terms of reference are:</P>

    <P>The group submitted its report to me in November 1998.</P>
    <P>A cross-departmental group on immigration was set up in April 2001 and is chaired by my Department. The purpose of the group is to give the Departments concerned an input into the development of immigration policy, to identify issues requiring a cross-departmental approach which need to be catered for in comprehensive new immigration legislation in fulfilment of the Government's commitment in this regard, and to consider how to address them. The group has not reported to date.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee on immigration, asylum and related matters was established in April 1997. Its purpose was to examine and report, at the request of Government, on immigration-asylum related issues on which an interdepartmental perspective was necessary. It reported to Government on matters referred to it on a number of occasions. It is not currently sitting and its role has largely been subsumed into the cross-departmental group on immigration.</P>
    <P>The human rights commission selection committee was set up on 27 July 2000. Its terms of reference were to identify suitable persons for possible consideration by the Government for appointment to the Human Rights Commission. The committee completed its task on 24 October 2000.</P>
    <P>A working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet was set up in February 1997. The terms of reference are as follows: to identify the nature and extent of the issues surrounding the illegal and harmful use of the Internet; to prioritise such issues with particular reference to the need to address the issue of child pornography in the short-term; to examine and assess the current approaches both domestically and internationally to addressing the problem of the illegal and harmful use of the Internet; in relation to those issues which can be domestically addressed, to identify the legal, technical and structural problems which arise and to make specific recommendations for their resolution in the short, medium and long-term as appropriate; and in relation to those issues which require resolution in an international context, to make recommendations which will inform policy in this regard. The report was published in July 1998.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group on the review of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 1986, was set up in May 1999. The terms of reference are as follows: to review the regulatory environment within which gaming and lottery activities are carried out with particular reference to the 1956 to 1986 Gaming and Lotteries Acts, <Col N="858" /> any other relevant or proposed Irish legislation and international developments in the gaming and lotteries area; to identify the issues arising from such a review and to make recommendations designed to address these issues in the context of securing a modern regulatory environment while fulfilling necessary social policy objectives; and to furnish a report on the above for consideration by me and by Government by the end of 1999. The group published its report in June 2000.</P>
    <P>A working group on the review of the coroner service was set up in December 1998. The terms of reference are as follows: to carry out a review of all aspects of the coroner service in Ireland and equivalent services in appropriate comparable jurisdictions; arising from such a review, and on the basis of broad consultation with interested parties, to identify the issues which must be addressed to ensure that the coroner service represents an appropriate response to the needs of society; to make specific recommendations in relation to these issues, including the most appropriate financial arrangements for the funding of the coroner service, the organisational structure within which the service is to be delivered, the nature of the core service to be delivered, the implications for other ancillary services and the legislative provisions required to implement such recommendations; to identify the specific steps which need to be taken in the short, medium and long-term in order to implement the proposed recommendations; and to furnish an interim report on the group's deliberations within a period of one year. The report was published in December 2000.</P>
    <P>A juvenile justice review group was established in July 1998. The terms of reference for the group are as follows: to examine intervention and prevention strategies as a means of keeping children out of the courts; to examine why there appears to be an increase in the numbers of children coming before the courts; to establish the behavioural patterns of children coming before the courts in the lead up to a court appearance; to examine the present non-custodial options open to the courts when dealing with children; and to examine best practice models in existence in this country and in a number of other countries where community sanctions are in place. The work of the group is ongoing.</P>
    <P>A justice and equality sector steering group was established in September 2000. The group was set up to: (a) facilitate cohesion in policy formulation and implementation across the mandates of the many organisations concerned; and (b) co-ordinate the approach of the agencies in the development and implementation of strategies to improve organisation, management and use of resources across the sector. The work of the group is ongoing.</P>
    <P>A justice and equality sector quality assurance group was established in May 2001 to validate <Col N="859" /> performance indicators set out for the justice and equality agencies under the PPF and to verify the achievement of those targets. The work of the group is ongoing.</P>
    <P>A heads of associated offices group was established in January 1997 to facilitate discussion between the Department and its associated offices on the SMI. The work of the group is ongoing.</P>
    <P>A policy planning research unit was established in February 1998 to develop the Department's capacity for generating and utilising research as part of its policy planning functions. The work of the group is ongoing.</P>
    <P>A communications steering group was established in September 2000 to consider the recommendations of the review of corporate and media communications in the Department conducted by Young Communications. The work of the group is ongoing.</P>
    <P>A performance management implementation group was established in May 2000 to prepare for, monitor and assist in the development and implementation of the performance management and development system in the Department. The work of the group is ongoing.</P>
    <P>A prisons staffing and operations review team was established in September 1998 to provide a credible record of what is actually happening in each prison, having regard to the role and function of the prison regime and the constraints which exist, establish the cost in man hours of running the prison with present rosters and work-posts, while providing for non-effective time e.g. sick leave and training; and make recommendations about how arrangements can be improved and/or work reorganised to deliver an effective service. The group reported in December 2000.</P>
    <P>The expert review group on the probation and welfare service was established on 27 November 1997. The terms of reference of the group are as follows: to examine the role of the probation and welfare service having regard to recent and current developments, the needs of the service, in the context of its proper role, to deliver an effective and efficient service, the organisational status of the service and to make recommendations and report back to Government within four months.</P>
    <P>The group produced two reports &ndash; the first report published in October 1998 and the final report published in July 1999. The conclusions-recommendations to the first report have, as far as it is practicable, been implemented. The final report is still under consideration, having regard to the value for money project currently under way by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Liquor Licensing was established in November 2000. The terms of reference of the commission are as follows: (1) to review the liquor licensing system in the light of <Col N="860" /> all relevant factors, including systems for the licensing of alcohol in other countries, and to make recommendations for a liquor licensing system geared to meeting the needs of consumers, in a competitive market environment, while taking due account of the social, health and economic interests of a modern society; (2) in particular, to review the scope for a system of additional licences, to examine demand in areas that are under-pubbed, new areas of increasing population, and tourist areas and to examine other aspects of the licensing system, such as licences for theatres and places of public entertainment, the licensing of residential accommodation which does not come under the definition of an hotel, interpretative centres and other places where the sale of alcohol is ancillary to the main business carried out; (3) to examine the nature of the off-licence and particularly the method of access to the off-licensed trade in the interests of promoting better competition; (4) to inquire into other aspects of the licensing code, as may be appropriate; (5) to make recommendations for any necessary legislative changes to give effect to the recommendations put forward; and (6) to submit a report within three months of the first meeting on paragraph 3 of its terms of reference and a final report within two years of the first meeting on all other matters.</P>
    <P>In line with these terms of reference, the commission presented an interim report on off-licensing in April of this year. The report contains recommendations relating to dormant licences, under-age drinking, off-licensing and certain related matters. The Government subsequently approved the publication of the interim report.</P>
    <P>By way of response to the substance of the commission's recommendations, the Government noted the intention to bring forward proposals for legislation in relation to the off-licensed sector at the earliest opportunity. The preparatory work is at an early stage. This is not a simple task, however, given the complexity of existing legislation in this area. Indeed, the commission itself refers in the interim report to &ldquo;the morass of licensing laws.&rdquo;  Regarding the recommendations not relating specifically to access to off-licences, the Government agreed that a co-ordinated response be developed by a high level, interdepartmental working group of the Departments and agencies concerned. The working group presented its report at the end of June. The Departments and agencies concerned have responded in a broadly positive and constructive way to the commission's recommendations and have indicated that they will be taking appropriate action to address them in due course. To underline the importance it attaches to the work of the liquor licensing commission, the Government has requested the working group to present a progress report on all actions taken in response to the interim report's recommendations by 31 <Col N="861" /> January 2002. The Government has also requested the commission to produce and submit additional interim reports on issues which can be progressed in advance of the commission's final report at the end of 2002. The commission has responded positively to this request and it is understood that a number of sub-committees have been established to look at specific areas within the liquor licensing code. The commission placed advertisements in national newspapers on 23 August last seeking submissions in relation to any aspect of the terms of reference and, in particular, to access to licences in urban and suburban centres of population; off-licence sales in convenience stores attached to garage forecourts; nightclubs, theatres and places of public entertainment and related public order issues; and registered clubs. it is understood that the commission is unable to say at present when further interim reports are likely to be ready for submission.</P>
    <P>The expert group appointed to consider changes in the criminal law which were recommended in the Garda SMI report, held its first meeting on 6 May 1998 and reported to me at the end of July 1998. The terms of reference are as follows:</P>
    <P>To consider changes in the criminal law recommended in the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána with particular reference to Constitutional and European Convention on Human Rights implications and having regard to the critical balance referred to in the report between the rights of the individual and that of the common good; and to report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not later than 30 June 1998.</P>
    <P>An environmental waste management policy group was established in June 1999 to integrate an environmental and waste management policy into the general prison management structure. The committee's September 2001 report is currently being considered by prison management.</P>
    <P>The criminal justice technology group 1 &ndash; legal issues &ndash; was established in September 2000 to investigate and report on the legal issues <i>vis-à-vis</i> video linking courts and prisons for bail and remand hearings, client-counsel consultation and visits. The group has not yet produced its report.</P>
    <P>The criminal justice technology group II &ndash; planning-building group &ndash; was established in September 2000 to investigate and report on the building and technical issues regarding video linking courts and prisons for bail and remand hearings, client-counsel consultations and visiting. The group has not yet produced its report.</P>
    <P>A prisoner transportation review committee was established in December 1999 to identify the most cost effective method of prisoner transpor<Col N="862" /> tation and review current procedures. Its report was published in November 2000.</P>
    <P>The Mountjoy complex redevelopment group was established in late 1999 to plan the redevelopment of the prison complex from both a building and regime perspective. Its first report was published in May 2000 and its second report was published in February 2001.</P>
    <P>A committee to monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on the Traveller community was established in June 1998. Its terms of reference are: to co-ordinate and monitor the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the task force on the Traveller community which have been accepted by the Government or by Ministers; to draw up and submit to the Government from time to time, starting in 1999, a progress report on the implementation of the recommendations, including proposals for acceleration or prioritisation of implementation of recommendations; to re-examine recommendations where necessary in the light of changes in Government policy and practice and of legislative, demographic, social and economic change; and to serve as a forum for consultation on current issues of national importance affecting the Traveller community. The first progress report of the committee was presented to the Minister in December 2000 and was published in April 2001.</P>
    <P>A high level steering group to implement the national anti-racism awareness programme, in partnership with the equality division of this Department was established on 6 January 2001. The steering group is broad-based and includes representatives of ethnic minority communities, IBEC, the ICTU, the community and voluntary sector, the farming sector, national bodies such as the Equality Authority and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, NCCRI, relevant Government Departments and An Garda Síochána. The overall aim of the programme is to contribute to creating the conditions for building an inclusive and intercultural society in Ireland where racism is effectively addressed and cultural diversity is valued.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the steering group are to implement the three year public awareness programme to address racism and to promote a more inclusive intercultural society and to provide a progress report to Government on an annual basis and publish an annual report. The first report of the group will be published at the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>The working group on equality proofing was established under the PPF in October 2000 to provide an ongoing focus on equality proofing issues. The terms of reference of the group are: to monitor the progress made in implementing the equality proofing initiatives proposed, operate as a &ldquo;learning mechanism&rdquo; to ensure that the experience gained in gender, poverty and equality <Col N="863" /> proofing would be presented in a report, outline steps which should be taken to progress from the learning phase to a broader implementation of equality proofing, advocate an ongoing focus on equality proofing issues, support this ongoing focus through the expertise and knowledge mobilised within the working group and through projects resourced by the group and promote awareness of equality proofing through seminars, workshops, conferences.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Garda authorities that the M50 is the subject of constant patrolling by units from the regional traffic divisions and the divisional traffic units.</P>
      <P>One unit from the regional traffic division is specifically assigned to patrol the motorway enforcing the road traffic laws and responding to any emergencies which may arise on this particular road. I am further informed that there is no evidence to suggest that there is extensive use of the M50 motorway by learner drivers. There are many motorists with &lsquo;L' signs displayed on their vehicles, but they may not be learner drivers.</P>
      <P>Dedicated patrols are allocated to the M50 motorway with covert and overt enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961, as amended. There is no evidence to indicate widespread contravention of the traffic laws in relation to the issue raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, specific patrols will be arranged to further deter learner drivers from illegally using the M50 and this issue will continue to receive attention.</P>

      <P>The following task forces or special committees have been set up in my Department since 1997. The National Drugs <Col N="865" /> Strategy Review Group, chaired by the Department, was set up in April 2000. Its terms of reference, in line with the commitment to review the current drugs strategy contained in the Review of the Government Programme and in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, were to identify the latest available data on the extent and nature of problem drug use in the country as a whole, any emerging trends in drug misuse and the areas with the greatest level of problem drug use; outline the current national drugs strategy, including the role of the statutory agencies and the community and voluntary sectors, in terms of supply reduction, education, prevention and awareness, risk reduction, treatment and rehabilitation, interagency co-ordination and integration as well as community-voluntary sector participation in the design and delivery of the strategies; examine the impact of the current national drugs strategy across the headings listed in the context of the objectives set for it and the resources allocated to date; identify any major gaps and deficiencies presenting across these headings; examine international trends, developments and best practice models; and in the light of the foregoing, consider how the current national drugs strategy, including the structures involved in its development and delivery, can be revised or modified to meet the gaps and deficiencies identified. The group reported in April 2001 and the new National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 was launched on 10 May 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Interim advisory committee on drugs which was chaired by the Minister of State at my Department was established in July 1999. Its terms of reference were to identify current information sets and research capacity in relation to the prevalence, prevention, treatment and consequences of drug misuse in Ireland; to specify priority information requirements for policy, both in respect of baseline data and ongoing monitoring; to propose a reporting framework in which information from statutory services, voluntary bodies and community groups can be gathered, analysed and interpreted; to review international co-operation with regard to information and research on all aspects of drug misuse; to identify mechanisms for ensuring the most effective use of resources in all aspects of information gathering and analysis with respect to drug misuse; to recommend a prioritised three year programme of research and evaluation on the extent, nature, causes and effects of drug misuse in Ireland, identifying the contribution to be made by all the relevant interests; and in the light of this programme, to recommend a structure and composition for a national advisory committee which would have continuing responsibility for research and information on drug misuse in Ireland. It reported in February 2000 and on the basis of its recommendations the national advis<Col N="866" /> ory committee was established by the Government in July 2000.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental group to review the sports capital programme was established in July 1998. It was chaired by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Its terms of reference were to review the sports capital programme with the objective of promoting a more strategic approach to the use of available resources for sport and recreation in Ireland. The group reported to me in December 1998 following which a revised sports capital programme was put in place for the 1999 round of sports capital grants.</P>
    <P>I also established an interdepartmental working group in August 1999 to develop guidelines and advise on the other key issues for the operation of a public-private partnership approach in relation to swimming pools. The terms of reference of the working group were to prepare a guidance document for local authorities which identifies the key issues in relation to the adoption of a PPP approach to the development of local authority swimming facilities. The working group reported in October 2000 and consideration of its findings is nearing completion. This consideration is taking into account recent developments in the area of PPPs, including the agreement of a national PPP policy framework, which sets out principles underlying the PPP process in Ireland and the publication of the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Bill, 2001, an enabling Bill in relation to the powers of state authorities to enter into PPPs and local authority powers to enter into joint ventures.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment or CE schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
      <P>At second level, the extra funding will be allocated to schools under the schools services support fund that I introduced last year. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £20 per pupil to £50 per pupil per annum, with a further increase to £70 per pupil next September. These increases are in addition to the £55 per pupil at present provided to schools for secretaries and caretakers where these are not provided under separate schemes. This element of £55 is subject to a ceiling of £19,250 per school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum annual grant under the services support fund for schools with 200 pupils or fewer will increase from £4,000 to £14,000 per year; while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise <Col N="873" /> from £10,000 to £35,000 each year. In the case of second level schools already receiving £55 per pupil for secretaries and caretakers they will, under this new scheme, also receive £70 per pupil bringing their combined total for a 500 pupil school to £54,250 per year.</P>
    <P>My Department is now arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>

      <Col N="874" /> Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels have now been finalised.

With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40, 50.79, to £60, 76.18, per pupil. This will be further increased to £80, 101.58, per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400, 3,047.37, to £4,800, 6,094.74, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000, 25,394.76, to £40,000, 50,789.52, per annum.</P>
    <P>At second level, the extra funding will be allocated to schools under the schools services support fund that I introduced last year. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £20, 25.40, per pupil to £50, 63.49, per pupil per annum, with a further increase to £70, 88.88, per pupil next September. These increases are in addition to the £55, 69.84, per pupil at present provided to schools for secretaries and caretakers where these are not provided under separate schemes. This element of £55, 69.84, is subject to a ceiling of £19,250, 24,442.46, per school.</P>
    <P>The minimum annual grant under the services support fund for schools with 200 pupils or fewer will increase from £4,000, 5,078.96, to £14,000 17,776.33, per year; while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000, 12,697.38, to £35,000, 44,440.83 each year. In the case of second level schools already receiving £55, 69.84, per pupil for secretaries and caretakers they will, under this new scheme, also receive £70, 88.88, per pupil bringing their combined total for a 500 pupil school to £54,250, 68,883.30, per year.</P>
    <P>My Department is now arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million, 2,539,476, to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and <Col N="875" /> entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
