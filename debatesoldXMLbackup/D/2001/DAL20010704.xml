      <P>I propose to deal separately with two notices of motion under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics from Deputies Naughten and McGinley. I will call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices. I call on Deputy Naughten to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a full statement to the House in line with his commitment last Thursday regarding the progress he has made to date with the investigation of the administration of animal vaccine to children in the early 1970s.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. <i>a</i>1, Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Amendment from the Seanad; No. 8, Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial Offices and Oireachtas Members (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2001 &ndash;<Col N="390" /> Order for Second Stage and Second and Subsequent Stages; No. 54, Adventure Activities Standards Authority Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; and No. 55, Local Government Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m., business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m. and the sitting shall be suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7 p.m.; the proceedings on No. <i>a</i>1 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 30 minutes and decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments to the Seanad amendment, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Education and Science; the Second and Subsequent Stages of No. 8 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments to the Bill, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; the Report and Final Stages of No. 54 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 5.15 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources; and the Report and Final Stages of No. 55 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m. by one question, which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we oppose this. At 10 p.m. the Local Government Bill will be concluded by one question. That is not adequate debating time. What has happened in this House in recent weeks has been a travesty of democracy. Bills are being shuttled through and the Opposition has no time to scrutinise or debate them. In many cases, Ministers do not know what is in the Bills and rely on briefs. There is no scrutiny of legislation in the House and we are putting through the Local Government Bill on one question despite the Bill raising profound issues for local democracy. We are not doing our job and there is no point in pretending we are. I object strongly to the use of the guillotine on the Local Government Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has been subjected to a parliamentary farce in recent weeks. The Government has failed repeatedly to bring forward legislation in the past six months. Legislation which was published has been delayed and hanging <Col N="392" /> around between Second Stage and Committee Stage. The Opposition is being asked to provide a veneer of democracy and parliamentary scrutiny while the relevant Ministers do not know what the amendments are, which is ridiculous. We do not accept a late sitting to provide for that farce. Accordingly, we are opposed to the late sitting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I wish to elaborate on some points made earlier specifically in relation to that legislation. The Opposition spokespersons are currently dealing with Committee Stage of the Waste Management (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill while the Minister responsible for introducing the Bill is, unfortunately, ill and has not been present for a couple of weeks. We wish him a speedy recovery, but those of us on this side who have ministerial experience know that other people are not, and cannot expect to be as well versed in relation to measures in the Bill. They cannot have digested the pages of amendments prepared by a struggling Bills Office that worked through the night under conditions that are probably in breach of health and safety regulations. They cannot have digested the technical implications of what is contained in the Local Government Bill.</P>
      <P>It is a farce that the Parliament is being asked to provide a veneer of parliamentary scrutiny of measures put forward by Ministers and Ministers of State. The Local Government Bill is being guillotined at 10 p.m. tonight and we are opposed to the measure.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am upset by the manner in which the Government has been conducting its business this week and for the last couple of weeks. An enormous amount of legislation has piled up and is being rushed through by means of <Col N="395" /> guillotine motions and without adequate debate. There has been very little parliamentary scrutiny of some very serious Bills.</P>
      <P>We all claim to be committed to the reform of this House but the Government is paying mere lip service to Dáil reform. I am particularly concerned about this Bill, which is fundamental to local democracy. The Minister, unfortunately, is absent through illness and it is clear that the Ministers of State who are dealing with the Bill are not completely familiar with the detail of it. Amendments are coming from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, of which the Minister is not closely aware and the implications of which he is not sure. The Opposition is not being given time to scrutinise these amendments properly.</P>
      <P>More than anything else, this is a Bill which has been constructed through deals in corners and back rooms with four Independent Deputies. Not only is there not proper accountability in this House, this is a Tammany Hall manner of legislation and we object strongly to it. The Government should be ashamed of itself. The Tánaiste, in particular, whose party has been for so long committed to Dáil reform, should be ashamed of herself.</P>

The Government has done deals with self-interested people who do not have the interest of the House at heart and it is now rattling the Bill through without considering the full implications of what it is proposing. This is an absolute disgrace and we oppose it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exchequer returns published yesterday clearly prove that the Estimates announced for last year's budget in December were wrong. Tax receipts have grown by only 5.3% compared to an estimate of 12.5%. VAT receipts which were expected to grow by 18% according to the Minister for Finance have grown by only 8%. Income tax is well short of the estimate also. These are worrying statistics and are largely due to the incompetence of the Minister for Finance. This being the position, will the Taoiseach confirm that if next year's budget contains tax reductions and expenditure increases similar to last year year's budget the whole surplus will be eliminated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and ask the Taoiseach, as a former Minister for Finance, if in the light of these figures he has sought a projection as to what the next quarter outturn might be and whether there will be a recovery in some of the taxation heads following the successful resolution of the foot and mouth disease problem? Is there cause within Government circles for revising the budget strategy that was being contemplated? Will the broad economic and policy guidelines set and agreed to by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach during the Swedish Presidency be complied with in the publication of the Government's budget on 5 December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The expenditure figures and receipts for the half year published yesterday show that for the first quarter tax revenue has increased but not in line with the budget figures. It had been indicated at the beginning of April, <Col N="399" /> after the first quarter, that the take on VAT receipts and consumer spending declined radically during February and March, the period of the foot and mouth disease crisis. The position improved in the last quarter but still there will be a difference of about £500 million. To respond to Deputy Quinn's question, it would mean we would have to look at the projections for the third quarter. Much will depend on the tourism season and other activities. Some ground will be gained but not the entire amount. The surplus for the year now being projected by the Department of Finance is of the order of £2 billion. Some independent commentators do not believe that will be achieved. Some of them were revising their figures this morning, based on yesterday's figures and the CSO figures of yesterday. We will have to monitor that during the course of the year.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Noonan, the tax strategy committee and the Government's preparation on the expenditure side in the Estimates has commenced. We have to keep in line with the broad economic guidelines. Needless to say it is too early yet to say what the frame of any tax package or social welfare package will be as we have not got to that stage but the Government will take account of the likely outturn position after the year on year as in any year and the projections as we approach the end of the third quarter. We would never make our assessments until that period. These issues will be looked at in early October when we should have a more likely correct outturn for the year as a whole. The questions I normally answer every year at this time when the figures are published &ndash; I think I have answered every year as Minister for Finance and as Taoiseach &ndash;  are questions I probably asked as leader of the Opposition. Usually Deputy Noonan would say the budget was wrong because the tax figures for the first six months were way ahead of the figures projected. That has been the position. Clearly, the period of the foot and mouth disease crisis pulled back expenditure and revenue quite dramatically. That is the main reason for the fall in revenue and is indicated by what has happened in the second quarter. We will continue to monitor the situation and to look at projections during the second half of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very significant reply by the Taoiseach. I put it to him that this is the first time in seven years, through the life of three Governments, that the Estimate of Revenue is falling behind what was given on budget day. I thank the Taoiseach for confirming that the expected surplus is now £2 billion according to the Department of Finance and about 18.5% according to private sector economists. Does the Taoiseach realise the combined expenditure and tax relief in the last budget was £2 billion. If that is repeated in the next budget the surplus will be gone on the Department of Finance figures and one is in deficit according to the private economists' figures. I know the Taoiseach cannot get into <Col N="400" /> detail, nor would I expect him to get into detail this early in the year about the next budget, but will he confirm if it is the Government's policy to continue to budget for surpluses in the next budget and going forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, is the answer to the last question. That is our commitment given our reckoning and the broad economic guidelines. To repeat what I said, independent economists are changing their figures today based on the CSO figures of yesterday because that is a factor on their figures. It is interesting that we are slightly worried about surpluses of more than £2 billion, which is an unusual position here. It is the policy of the Government to continue to budget for surpluses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Taoiseach has had a chance to reflect on his remarks in the House yesterday with regard to the flagship semi-State company, the ESB? If he does not correct the remarks he made yesterday under some pressure, he will do untold damage to the reputation of this company. To suggest that the management of the ESB, a company that brought electrification to every rural house in the country, was so inept that within a week of getting to the second stage of a bid it had not realised the scale of the project is to do untold damage to the reputation of management of a company that is trading competitively in 35 countries with the largest consultancy firm that personnel have here, more than 450 people trading in ESB international. He knows from his own experience as a Minister that the competitors of the ESB will have monitored what has been said. When the ESB goes to head on bids down the road, those companies will look at what has been said by the Prime Minister of the country from which this State company comes. Does the Taoiseach realise the extraordinary damage he has done to the reputation of this company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that commercial decisions about the ESB should be taken by the board of the ESB and not by a sub-committee of Cabinet. Given that the sub-committee of Cabinet has, in effect, taken over the functions of the board of the ESB, will the sub-committee of Cabinet lay down ongoing commercial policy for the ESB? Many people would consider the four members of the Cabinet sub-committee to be competent politicians but nobody would credit them with having a lot of expertise in running electricity companies. As a matter of <Col N="401" /> fact, the public would be of the view that the four together could hardly replace a fuse or wire a plug.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During Question Time yesterday, on European questions, I was asked about this and I will repeat what I said then. I spoke to the ESB chief executive and officials on different business on Monday and I am meeting them again today with the Cabinet infrastructural committee. There are no differences, difficulties, misunderstandings or putting the position wrongly. Deputy Quinn is entirely incorrect on that matter. At the Gothenburg summit meeting, I spoke to Prime Minister Buzek of Poland about this matter. The figures and projections of the extent of what would be on offer changed on the Polish side. There was no error by ESB management, or ESBI which is dealing with this matter. The extent of the offer being put out for ESB companies was extended. The reason it was then brought to the Cabinet sub-committee was for us to examine this issue because the ESB wanted to go in to the extent of about £600 million on a project which was expected to go up to £1 billion. That would ultimately be bigger than the ESB itself&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Or even bigger than the Abbotstown project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government was looking at the Polish project at the request of the ESB. The considered view of all Government officials who examined this proposition was that, at a time when the priority of the Government and the ESB was to deal with the enormous infrastructural problems, borrowings and technical work which the company has to deal with, particularly in the north-west, the western seaboard generally and many other areas &ndash; I have answered questions in the House in recent months about windfarms and other developments &ndash; the ESB could not do both. That is not to say that the ESB cannot continue with other major expansion plans, both inside and outside the country, with which it wishes to go ahead and which the Government is currently considering. Eirgrid and the ESB are on the agenda for the Cabinet infrastructural committee today. That was already planned before the Polish issue developed to the present extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were five or six companies in the Polish situation, now there are four. The position is clearly understood by the ESB and ESBI. They would have liked to go ahead but there was a risk in that assessment. Perhaps it might have worked out satisfactorily but the view in the Department of Finance, my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise was that the risk could be <Col N="402" /> just too great. It was on that basis the Government made its decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A supplementary question from Deputy Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach knows the ESB is a State company. It is not in a position to make the comments which he has made publicly. He also knows, and the Tánaiste certainly knows, just how damaging the remarks are and how competitors from other countries will seek to undermine many projects which the IDA is trying to attract to this country. Such attempts were made in the past and we successfully convinced those concerned to come here. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste must surely be aware of the politics of international business and investment. If the Taoiseach does not correct the record and demonstrate that the ESB was capable and in favour of going ahead with this project and saw no conflict between its requirements for investment here in Ireland and the necessity to invest commercially abroad to develop a new stream of income &ndash; I believe he is big enough to try to correct those remarks &ndash; he will seriously undermine a major flagship semi-State company and do untold damage to the future of the people who work in the ESB and the people of this country who depend on the ESB for a constant and quality electricity supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that there is nothing to correct in this regard. The ESB has the support of Government for investment in overseas markets, in which the company has established a reputation for excellence. The decision that the ESB should not proceed with investment plans in Poland was made on a purely commercial basis. In buying shares first and then moving to an investment position, the ESB would be getting into something bigger than itself. The financial and commercial judgment was that this was a step too far. The ESB has other plans but this was on a scale not previously contemplated by the company and, of course, Government guarantees would be required. The electricity network in this country is in need of extensive renewal over the next five years, not the next 50 years, on the ESB's own admission. The ESB is facing a 3 billion upgrading programme between now and 2006, for which it requires all its technical and management expertise. It is an excellent company but to attempt all that and put back the IPO for five or six years would create too many problems for the company all at one time.</P>

      <P>The two things are not mutually exclusive. One complements the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's first priority is that the ESB can deal with this major investment programme for its Irish consumers. There is no problem. The ESB's position is that, as it downsizes in this country in response to compe<Col N="403" /> tition and loss of market share as an inevitable consequence of EU directives, it must compensate for that elsewhere. The Government is totally supportive of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is looking at a number of other proposals. I would say to Deputy Stagg, who is ranting on about this, that it is not sound commercial practice for the ESB to attempt to take over a company which is bigger than itself. There are other projects which, on a commercial basis, the ESB will be able to take over. That is the factual position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I raised an issue with the Taoiseach about the need for legislation to protect insurance policy holders of a company which has gone into liquidation in the UK. It is clear from the Minister's reply to me last Wednesday that there is a need for protection law for insurance holders who buy insurance from an English based company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The UK Policyholder Protection Act protects English insurance holders but not those small Irish firms which bought public liability insurance and the 9,000 motorcyclists who bought insurance. It is not good enough that this is &ldquo;being studied&rdquo; with a report awaited. As we speak, people are without insurance cover and I want to know what the Government intends to do about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two matters. On promised legislation, I asked the Taoiseach yesterday about the legislation arising from the DIRT report in respect of the Oireachtas commission. I think the Taoiseach misinterpreted my question as being about speeding it up over the summer. I was really referring to the need to allocate the heads of the Bill to whatever committee is considered appropriate. The principles are important. It concerns the organisation of the <Col N="404" /> Oireachtas, not the Executive, consultants or officials, all of whose input would be valuable. It is about how we do our business. Parliamentarians ought to have an opportunity to look at the legislation at the heads of Bill stage.</P>
      <P>The second point is whether the Government is contemplating legislation on the regulation of auctioneers, given what we read &ndash; not for the first time &ndash; about the conduct of some auctioneers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <P>In the second half of 1999 the Taoiseach in answering a question in the House drew attention to a statement made at that time by the Government about the transition to digitalisation. The Taoiseach also told the House that proposals for digitalisation would be included in the then promised broadcasting Bill. Given that the opportunities for digitalisation are being entirely squandered, what legislation has he in mind to publish during the summer or in the autumn that might try to save something from this transition? A national asset is being effectively squandered. The Taoiseach stated that the pro<Col N="407" /> posals for digitalisation in broadcasting would be adequately dealt with in the broadcasting legislation, but that was not the case. It is now suggested that digitalisation will not be revisited by the Government until 2003. At that stage everything will have been handed to Rupert Murdoch, and the alleged Republican Party will have squandered a national asset.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation governing the pay, pensions and other work conditions is scattered over individual statutes going back over 40 years and many subsections of those Acts have been amended several times in the interval. For an interested person, chasing through the Statute Book to get to the bottom of even one issue can be a cross between hide and seek and a particularly tough crossword puzzle. It never is the right time to consolidate <Col N="409" /> this kind of legislation and I will not take it on during the life of this Dáil. However, this Bill does incidentally tidy up some of those provisions by rewriting specific sections of the 1938 Act. There is unfortunately a cost of so doing in terms of Members' attention: it involves repeating word for word various subsections of earlier Acts which are not being amended by this Bill. Various changes are set out in different groups in the Bill but I propose to deal together with each of three major strands which run through parts of it.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives legislative effect to certain recommendations of report No. 38 of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector concerning the payment of long service increments to Deputies and Senators and the payment of an allowance to Ministers of State who routinely attend meetings of the Government. The report of the review body recommended that the salary of a Dáil Deputy should be set at the ordinary maximum of the grade of principal, standard scale, in the Civil Service and that the salary of a Senator should be fixed as 70% of that of a Deputy and that both should be revised for the future on that basis. The review body went on to note that long service increments are payable to principals in the Civil Service. One long service increment is payable after three years satisfactory service at the maximum of the scale and a second is payable after six years satisfactory service at the maximum of the scale. A principal entering the grade at the minimum of the scale would have to serve seven years in the grade before becoming eligible for the first long service increment and ten years before becoming eligible for the second. The review body indicated that the introduction by the Government of long service increments for Deputies and Senators would not be incompatible with a link to the grade of principal provided the service as a Deputy or Senator required to qualify for long service increments was comparable to that required of principals. The Government decided to introduce long service increments on this basis.</P>
    <P>The review body went on to state that the introduction of long service increments for Deputies and Senators should not result in a situation where different rates of remuneration apply to Ministers. This situation could come about because the remuneration of office holders is made up of an office holder's salary plus the salary of a Deputy or Senator. Accordingly, the application of long service increments could result in Ministers who are Members of the same House being paid differently depending on whether they qualify as a Deputy for two, one or no long service increments. The review body considered that the principle that all Ministers are paid the same remuneration is an important one and that the arrangements for the introduction of long service increments should ensure a common rate of remuneration continues to apply to Ministers and Ministers of State. Likewise, it considered that their introduction should not result <Col N="410" /> in other office holders being paid in excess of the rates it recommended for their posts</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Bill provides that Deputies will be eligible for one long service increment after seven years and a further increment after another three years service &ndash; the same provision is included for Senators. As drafted, service as a Deputy and Senator are counted separately for the purposes of calculating the qualifying period. On reflection, it would be more appropriate that service in the Oireachtas rather than membership of any single House should be the criterion. I will be proposing an appropriate amendment on Committee stage. Long service increments will apply with effect from 25 September 2000, the date of the review body report. In line with the Government decision on the phasing in of the pay recommendations of the report, long service increments will be phased in between 25 September 2000 and 1 April 2002. In keeping with the recommendations of the review body, however, ministerial and parliamentary office holders will be paid the standard rate for a Deputy or Senator, as appropriate, and will not receive long service increments for the duration of their terms of office, regardless of their length of service in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The review body also considered the position of Ministers of State who routinely attend Government meetings. There are two such Ministers of State &ndash; the Minister of State with special responsibility as the Government Chief Whip and the Minister of State to the Government. The review body considered that these Ministers of State carry additional responsibility which warrants remuneration additional to that payable to other Ministers of State and that they should receive an allowance equivalent to that payable to the chairperson of the Committee of Public Accounts and the chairpersons of certain other committees. The Bill provides that such an allowance may be paid to not more than two Ministers of State who routinely attend meetings of the Government and are designated by Government order.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to take this opportunity to add the position of assistant party Whip in the Dáil to the positions in the Dáil and Seanad that receive an allowance in recognition of the important work carried out by the Whips in ensuring the smooth running of Dáil business. This allowance will apply to parties with seven or more Members in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>One of the positions in receipt of an allowance is that of Leader of the Seanad. The Government has decided that the Leader should be treated for pay purposes as an office holder and that the allowance paid to him will become the salary attaching to the post.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that Deputies, Senators, ministerial and parliamentary office holders and those holding positions that attract allowances will be able to refuse a pay increase if they should so chose. It has long been a cause of concern to me that Members of the Oireachtas who express <Col N="411" /> their concerns about pay increases for politicians find themselves in the unfortunate position of having no choice but to accept those pay increases themselves. I am happy to follow the established Government policy of accepting the recommendations of the independent review body which, since its establishment in 1969, has made recommendations on the remuneration of not just politicians but also members of the Judiciary and top posts right across the public service. These recommendations have at all times been based on in-depth research and careful assessment of the appropriate position of the posts concerned within the general economy, but if any Member of this House believes that a pay increase is not appropriate, I see every reason for giving him or her the opportunity to refuse it. The Bill provides for this. A refusal will apply to a particular pay increase and further notice may be given if the individual wishes to refuse subsequent increases. An individual may later decide to rescind the refusal, but only from a current date &ndash; arrears will not be paid. If there is any Member who is unhappy with a proposed pay increase, now is their opportunity to say thanks &ndash; but no thanks.</P>
    <P>As a result of legislation introduced in 1998, allowances are paid to the chairs and vice-chairs of committees, committee Whips and the chairs of sub-committees. Not all such positions attract an allowance, and different rates apply to different committees. A Government order will be introduced shortly extending the payment of allowances to all such positions, except where they are held by ministerial or parliamentary office holders, and providing for the same rates to apply to all committees.</P>
    <P>I have accepted the advice of the parliamentary counsel that the legislation governing the pay of Members of the Oireachtas, ministerial and parliamentary office holders and members of the Judiciary would benefit from some refinement. This corpus of legislation, which stretches back over many Acts to 1938, is complex and the changes proposed by the parliamentary counsel will serve to bring greater clarity to some important elements of it. This corpus of legislation. which stretches back over many Acts to 1938, is complex and the changes proposed by the parliamentary counsel will serve to bring greater clarity to some important elements of it.</P>
    <P>Under pensions, we have the Office Holder Pensions and Severance Allowances &ndash; sections 11 to 16 and 29; contributions to Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pension Scheme &ndash; section 27; postal facilities &ndash; section 33; general expense allowance for the Attorney General &ndash; section 35; and Transfer of Service for Members of the Oireachtas, Judiciary and Court Officers  &ndash; sections 46 to 60.</P>
    <P>I am also introducing a number of amendments to the pension and severance allowance regime for Ministers and other office holders. I have <Col N="412" /> reviewed these superannuation entitlements and have come to the conclusion that a number of the existing provisions need to be amended to take account of the role and responsibilities of office holders and to bring certain provisions relating to spouse's and children's pensions more into line with modern practice. In addition, I am providing for the transfer of pensionable service into and out of the pension schemes for Members of the Oireachtas, Irish Members of the European Parliament, the Judiciary and court officers.</P>
    <P>I have given a great deal of thought to the pension provisions for office holders and have decided that it is appropriate to make a certain number of chances. As Deputies will appreciate, the pension provisions are somewhat complex. Sections 11 to 19 provide for certain amendments to the pension and severance payments available to office holders and their surviving spouses and children under the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, which I shall refer to as the 1938 Act while speaking about office holder pensions.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the Bill provides that, instead of an allowance, the Leader of the Seanad will be paid a salary as an office holder. The position will be pensionable as a secretarial office under the office holders' pension scheme and section 11 provides accordingly by naming the position of Leader of the House in Seanad Éireann as a secretarial office for the purposes of the office holders' pension scheme. with effect from 17 September 1997.</P>
    <P>At present, a former office holder who has the necessary service qualifies for a pension under the office holder pension scheme if he or she is 55 years or older. However, it is possible for a person who is aged between 50 and 55 to opt to take a discounted pension instead which takes account of the increased length of time for which the pension will be payable. I propose to remove the option to take a discounted pension and to reduce the minimum age for payment of pension under the office holders pension scheme to 50. Section 12 provides for these changes by amending section 13A of the 1938 Act. The office of the Attorney General advised that subsection (5) of section 13A of the 1938 Act be redrafted for the sake of clarity. Section 12 is, as a result, quite a long section but the substantive changes are towards the end of the section in the amendments to subsection (7) of section 13A of the 1938 Act and the new subsections (9) and (10) of that section. This change will apply from the date this Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I am reducing the minimum length of service needed to qualify for a pension under the office holders' pension scheme from the present three years to two years. Entitlement to maximum pension under the office holders' pension scheme accrues over ten years. This fast accrual reflects the responsibilities attaching to public office at this level and it is reasonable that the minimum period of service required to gain entitlement to a pension should also reflect the reality and the <Col N="413" /> vicissitudes of life in political office. A person with two years' qualifying service will be entitled to a pension of 20% of the appropriate salary, building up to the existing 25% rate under the new office holders' scheme for three years' service. This change will apply to and in respect of all former office holders who have at least two years but less than three years' service as an office holder because I see no reason a person who was an office holder before now for at least two years but less than three years should not be entitled to a pension for that service if present and future office holders are to have that entitlement. This change is being implemented by section 13 which inserts a new section 13AA in the 1938 Act and will apply from the date the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>I am also making changes to the rules of the office holders pension scheme in so far as they affect an Attorney General who is not at the same time a Member of either House. Taking the case of an Attorney General who is a Member of either House, he or she is paid the same salary as a Minister and is pensioned on that amount under the office holders' pension scheme. He or she is also paid a salary as a Member and the service as a Member is pensionable under the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) Pension Scheme. However, if the Attorney General is not a Member of either House, he or she is paid the same salary as a Minister and, in addition, an amount equal to a Deputy's salary. At present, that additional amount is not taken into account under the office holders' pension scheme. This is anomalous and I propose to rectify it.</P>
    <P>Section 13, accordingly, inserts a new section 13AB in the 1938 Act which enables this to be done. This change will apply, with effect from the date this Bill is passed, to and in respect of surviving former Attorneys General who are entitled to a pension under the office holders' pension scheme. An associated provision is included in section 17 to allow a similar change to be made in the calculation of a severance allowance payable to an Attorney General who is not also a Member of either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 14 inserts a new section 13E in the 1938 Act which provides for an increase in a secretarial pension to take account of the new allowance payable to Ministers of State who regularly attend meetings of the Government. Payment of this allowance, which was recommended by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, is dealt with later in section 40. Section 18 enables the allowance to be taken into account for severance payment purposes.</P>
    <P>I have also reviewed the provisions in the office holders' pension scheme for payment of benefits to spouses and children of former office holders. There are a number of outdated provisions in that area which I propose to amend with effect from the date this Bill is enacted. The existing scheme allows a pension to be paid to the surviving spouse of a former office holder only where the marriage took place before or while the person <Col N="414" /> held office. This is a very unusual provision and I am changing it to allow a spouse's pension to be paid regardless of when the marriage took place. The change is in section 15 which, on the advice of the office of the Attorney General, rewrites section 20 of the 1938 Act in its entirety.</P>
    <P>Section 15 also makes two amendments to the provisions for payment of an allowance to the surviving children of an office holder. At present, a child's allowance, as it called in this scheme, is payable only to the child of a marriage which took place before or while a person was an office holder. In future, any child. stepchild or adopted child of a deceased office holder will be entitled to a child's allowance subject to the rules of the scheme. The other amendment is that for obvious equality reasons, I am extending to male children the present rule that a child's allowance to a female ceases on marriage.</P>
    <P>Section 16 inserts three new sections, 20A, 20B and 20C, into the 1938 Act. The new section 20A confirms the existing practice that a child's allowance under the office holders' pension scheme is increased in line with general pay increases in the Civil Service. The new section 20B provides that a child's allowance can continue in payment for a child's lifetime where the child is permanently incapacitated and the incapacity arose before the child was 21. The new section 20C amends the provision whereby a spouse's pension ceases when the surviving spouse remarries. This provision is common to public sector pension schemes generally. However, it would normally be accompanied by a provision that payment of pension may recommence where there are compassionate grounds for it. I am amending the office holders' scheme to allow the Minister for Finance to reinstate a spouse's pension which has ceased on remarriage where the marriage has been annulled or dissolved or where there are compassionate grounds for it.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for the replacement section 31 (1) of the 1938 Act, which provides for the payment of a special allowance to a former Taoiseach who has not reached the age of 55, which was the age for payment of a pension under the office holders' scheme, and who has not applied for a discounted pension. Since I am reducing the age for payment of a pension from 55 to 50 years and removing the option to take a discounted pension, it is necessary to change the reference to age 55 in section 31 to age 50 and to remove the reference to a discounted pension.</P>
    <P>Section 27 is a technical amendment to section 6A of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938, which provides for pension deductions to be made from the salaries of Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As it stands, section 6A is based on there being a single rate of pay for Members of each House. The amended text takes account of the introduction of long service increments, which are to be pensionable, so that contributions to the scheme can be deducted from them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> Section 29 repeals a provision relating to spouses' pensions under the office holders' pension scheme which was included on a stand-alone basis in the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1952 and which is now incorporated in the revised version of section 20 of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938 which is being inserted by section 15 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, the provision of free postal facilities to Oireachtas Members under existing legislation is subject to the requirement that those facilities be used solely for matters arising out of a Member's parliamentary duties. I am aware there has been some concern on the part of Members in relation to the operation of the existing provision and, specifically, to the interpretation of the term &ldquo;parliamentary duties&rdquo;. The case has been made to me that the existing interpretation of that term does not properly reflect or facilitate Members' needs in regard to their normal day-to-day usage of the free postal facilities. I acknowledge that difficulties have arisen in this regard, in large part due to the absence in existing legislation of a precise definition of the term &ldquo;parliamentary duties&rdquo;. The difficulty is in deciding what precisely the term &ldquo;parliamentary duties&rdquo; encompasses. It is debatable whether one could come up with a satisfactory, comprehensive and workable definition as to what exactly constitutes &ldquo;parliamentary duties&rdquo; for the purposes of determining Members' entitlements to free postal facilities.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter, I am satisfied that it would be impractical to attempt to lay down in legislation detailed parameters on the use of free postal facilities. In the absence of a precise and workable definition of &ldquo;parliamentary duties&rdquo;, it seems to me that the only practical alternative is to remove that phrase from the legislation. I propose, therefore, in section 33 to delete the term &ldquo;parliamentary duties&rdquo; from section 2 of the 1962 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 37 enables the general expense allowance currently paid to all office holders who are Members of the Oireachtas to be paid to an Attorney General who is not a Member of the Oireachtas. The allowance is to meet costs necessarily incurred by office holders in the performance of the duties of their office which will not otherwise be reimbursed. However, existing legislation only provides for the payment of the allowance to office holders if they are also Members of the Oireachtas. An Attorney General who is not a Member of the Dáil or Seanad would not be entitled to receive the allowance. This anomaly is now being removed and the provision will be backdated to June 1997.</P>
    <P>Part 10 provides for the transfer of pensionable service into and out of the Oireachtas pension scheme, the pension scheme for Irish Members of the European Parliament and the pension schemes for the Judiciary and court officers. Long-standing arrangements are in place which allow employees of public sector bodies which are <Col N="416" /> members of the public sector and local authority transfer networks to transfer service when they move to another body in the networks. It has not been possible for Members of the Oireachtas and the Judiciary and court officers to transfer service. This Bill introduces provisions which will allow this and which will apply to Irish Members of the European Parliament because their pension scheme is based on the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) pension scheme.</P>
    <P>The mechanism will be that transfer of service will be possible between the pension schemes for Members of the Oireachtas, Irish Members of the European Parliament, the Judiciary and court officers, the Civil Service, bodies which are designated as approved organisations for the purposes of the public sector transfer network and any other body which is designated by the Minister for Finance under this Act. The detailed operation of the arrangements will be subject to terms and conditions determined by the Minister for Finance and those terms and conditions will take account of the enhanced pension accrual rates which apply to Members of the Oireachtas and the Judiciary and court officers. It will not be possible to transfer service in respect of which a pension has already come into payment but it will be possible to repay a lump sum or a refund of contributions paid in respect of previous service which a person wishes to transfer.</P>
    <P>Turning to the individual sections, sections 46 to 49 define a number of terms and give the Minister for Finance power to designate organisations as approved organisations for the purposes of this part. Sections 50 to 53 set out the basic entitlement of Members of the Oireachtas, Irish Members of the European Parliament, the Judiciary and court officers to transfer service. Section 54 provides that transfer of service will be subject to terms and conditions determined by the Minister for Finance or, as appropriate, terms and conditions agreed by the Minister with a designated organisation. In determining the extent to which service can be transferred, account may be taken of differences between pension schemes in terms of the length of time required to earn entitlement to maximum benefit under a scheme. If the transfer of service involves an organisation which is designated as an approved organisation, the terms and conditions agreed between the Minister and the organisation must either provide for the payment of a contribution or set out agreed reciprocal arrangements for the transfer of service.</P>
    <P>Section 55 provides that, once service has been transferred, it cannot reckon for superannuation purposes in the organisation from which the service was transferred. Section 56 prohibits transfer of service where a pension has already come into payment; it allows the transfer of service in respect of which a lump sum or gratuity has been paid or contributions have been refunded, provided the lump sum, gratuity or contributions, plus interest, are paid back.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> Section 57 deals with the detail of applying for transfer of service under these provisions. Section 58 allows pension schemes to be amended to take account of these new transfer provisions where the authorities who are responsible for the scheme would not already have the power to make such amendments. Section 59 provides for the making of orders under this part and requires that such orders must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 60 enables the trustees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) pension scheme to make and receive transfer payments for the purposes of this part.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the remuneration and tenure of the chairmen and deputy chairmen of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. In the course of the review of issues affecting parliamentarians, the question arose of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle remaining in office during the period when the Dáil was dissolved. The general assumption was that this could not be done because there was not during that period any Dáil for which his deputy chairmanship function needed to be exercised. The position became less clear when legal advice was sought. There is provision in the Constitution for a Ceann Comhairle to be re-elected to the Dáil without standing for election but there is no provision in the Constitution, legislation or standing orders to keep on a Ceann Comhairle who does not wish to be elected to the new Dáil. However, both the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach are members of the Presidential Commission which can be required to act during the period of dissolution. It is, therefore, constitutionally necessary to ensure that the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach are retained in office to ensure that the Presidential Commission which may have to exercise its function during a dissolution is properly and fully constituted. Since, under the Constitution, their position is taken by the deputy chairmen should they be incapacitated or unavailable, it is necessary to make the same provision for them. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in so far as it seeks to address a number of shortcomings in the provision for parliamentary office holders and Oireachtas Members although it does not go far enough in a number of key respects. The Bill reasonably makes handsome provision for Ministers and the two Ministers of State who attend Cabinet meetings to be paid an additional salary of £11,800. I welcome the provision for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Leas-Chathaoirleach to be paid until such time as an election is held and accept the arguments outlined in this regard. The Bill also provides that the Leader of the Seanad will be an office holder, a long overdue provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill refers to the provision of similar severance pay to the Attorney General to that which Ministers receive. There are also severance pay arrangements for Deputies. I have to declare my interest in this because I am a former chairman of a committee, but that is not the reason I am <Col N="418" /> saying this. Holders of offices within these Houses other than the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach are not well provided for in this Bill in the sense that severance arrangements do not apply for chairmen, vice-chairmen or convenors of committees or the Opposition Leader in the Seanad. There are arrangements whereby Opposition Whips are paid in recognition of their having to work with the Government Chief Whip to keep the business of this House going. As we are making formal provision for Leader of the Seanad, some provision should be made for the Opposition Leader in the Seanad. I received some indication this will be addressed on Committee Stage and I ask the Minister of State to clarify that, as there are no amendments tabled yet to indicate that it will be.</P>
    <P>Likewise, why should chairmen, vice-chairmen and convenors of committees be the only office holders for whom there are no severance arrangements? In other words, they have to take a sharp cut in pay when they lose office, which does not apply to anyone else? That will not apply to the Attorney General, as that has been corrected. The lack of such provision is unfair. Provision should be made for those office holders and I had thought that provision for them would be made in the Bill. I have given a great deal of thought to the effectiveness of this House and the arrangements for it and my views are largely spelt out in the Fine Gael Policy document, &ldquo;A Democratic Revolution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday when we were dealing with another Bill that has a remarkably similar title, which is somewhat confusing, we cannot improve the pay, conditions and back-up for some Members of this House without also taking account of the other side of the coin, the overhauling these Houses. It must be obvious to anybody who is familiar with the state of politics here that we cannot continue to legislate the way we have being doing and especially the way we have in the past four weeks. We cannot go on addressing empty seats as we are now. Legislation is being rushed through without scrutiny and I predict with certainty that many of the Bills pushed through under guillotine this week, last week, the week before and the week before that will give rise to serious problems later due to a lack of scrutiny. In order to give them such scrutiny we have to properly resource the House.</P>
    <P>It is not provided for in this Bill, but the Minister gave some indication yesterday in his reply to the debate on the other Bill that Members of the House will be provided with extra staff. That is justified by the enormous weight of legislation introduced in recent years, which has imposed enormous demands on Members. I make no bones about this and the Minister admitted he was in the same position. I have been a Member of this House for almost 25 years and I have no way of keeping records because I have no staff to keep them. I have one secretary who has been overwrought and over-worked for the past 22 <Col N="419" /> years trying to keep up with replying to the mail and answering the telephone. We have no one to photocopy or to do research. No other employment would operate on the basis on which we operate. There is no provision in this Bill or in the Bill we debated yesterday to confirm some provision will be made for that.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Commission Bill will be introduced later in the year and I have a particular interest in it because it will give expression to my view that there is a radical need for parliamentary reform. Such a commission would at least set up a structure which would permit more dramatic and relevant reform than has been hitherto possible. We are living in expectation that the Bill, the heads of which we have not had sight of although I understand they have been approved by the Government, will be dramatic in the sense of the financial provision it will make for the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This Bill, the Bill we debated yesterday, which I will call the Leaders' allowance Bill for shorthand, and the Electoral (Amendment) Bill do much in terms of the rights of parties in making provision for the funding of them. That legislation makes too great a provision for the funding of smaller parties which will lead to a splintering of the process. Under that Bill any party that gets 2% of the vote will get £100,000 <i>per se</i>. That is a recipe for inviting all sorts of head cases including parties, such as the Monster Raving Loony Party, as I said yesterday, to run a candidate in every constituency. If a small party were to get 2% of the vote in every constituency, it would get £100,000 a year regardless of whether a member of it were to be elected. The deposits required to run candidates in 42 constituencies would be only a few hundred quid. A small party, therefore, could make such an investment and run, say, Peter Barry in every constituency, as some extreme Unionists ran a candidate in the North, get 2% of the vote and then get £100,000 a year. That provision is included in the legislation simply to provide for the Progressive Democrats for fear that their percentage of the vote might drop below 3%. We are using a very broad brush in this context. There should be at least a requirement that a small party must have a candidate elected to this House, to secure that amount. The provision in the legislation is too broad.</P>
    <P>There is handsome provision for parties in legislation, but there is no provision in it for individual Members. We appear to have no rights. We have to do what the party leadership tells us. I have been saying this for years, therefore, it is nothing to do with who is Leader. Members are elected individually to this House. They have a duty individually to ensure they perform their parliamentary work. They have a right to be properly resourced. This legislation makes no provision in that respect. The Leaders' allowance Bill makes handsome provision for Leaders' allowances and resources to be made available to parties, but individual Members have no rights. If <Col N="420" /> they are out of favour with their Leader, they are in trouble. That is wrong.</P>
    <P>Likewise the provisions in this Bill pulls its punches when it comes to individual Deputies. I got a table this morning, for which I am grateful, outlining the pay rates for a TD, Senator, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, a Minister, the Ceann Comhairle, a Minister of State, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Cathaoirleach. The figures on this table do not correspond to the figures in the Bill, which I am aware relate to different dates. Will the Minister of State clarify what is the current salary of a TD and of a TD with long service increments having ten years' service and when will it be equal to the salary of a principal officer as it is supposed to be? The Bill states, and these salaries apply from 25 September 2000, that the salary of a TD is £41,143, the salary of a TD with seven years' service is £42,455, and the salary of a TD with ten years' service is £43,767. The table I was provided with this morning gives salaries of £46,382, £47,862 and £49,342, respectively. An accompanying table gives the salary scale for principal officers. It states that the salary of a principal officer at the higher rate having ten years' service is £58,840 and the salary of a principal officer at the ordinary rate is £54,834. Will the Minister of State clarify whether the top level advisory committee, or whatever that pay body is called, has recommended that the pay of a TD with ten years' service should be at the maximum of the principal officer rate? If so, why is there a difference in the figures? I would like some explanation of the figures. What is the pay of a principal officer at the top rate with ten years' service and what is the pay of a Deputy? When will they be reconciled? What is the ultimate target for a Deputy's salary?</P>
    <P>We are making provision today that the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Leas-Cheann Comhairle would be paid up to election day, which is only right. The Bill contains a measure which restates an existing provision that states Deputies will be paid one eighteenth of their salaries for the period of an election. I do not know from where that calculation came. Why are Deputies not paid like Senators? Why is it not acknowledged that their employment continues until their successors are elected? If it is a four week campaign they should get four weeks' pay and three weeks' pay for a three week campaign, both of which should be pensionable. We get a payment in lieu of one eighteenth, which comes to 2.88 weeks' wages. Will the Minister of State confirm whether, because of the inquiries of the Public Offices Commission, Deputies will continue to be permitted, as before, to use their parliamentary offices and secretaries during an election? That has been the practice since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>An issue which I raised privately with the Minister of State is the plight of widows, and not just widows of Deputies or Senators but of public servants. It is funny that in the social welfare code as well as the public sector code we provide extra<Col N="421" /> ordinarily badly for widows. A widow loses her spouse &ndash; it is a woman in most cases but a man may also lose his spouse &ndash; through sudden death, accident or illness and immediately she is expected to live on a quarter of his pay. That is an awful commentary, particularly in relation to Deputies and Senators, as everyone knows no Deputy can do the job without the active support and enormous sacrifice of a spouse. Yet if he or she dies that spouse gets one quarter of the pay and I know of related cases of severe hardship.</P>
    <P>Similarly, under the social welfare code widows are living on something like £75 per week. They have no free schemes and they are paid £25 less than an old age pensioner. The free schemes are worth about £30 per week, so if they are living alone and have no eligible dependent children they are on a very low level of income. We seem to have a mental block against treating widows properly and I urge the Minister of State to introduce a scheme without further delay where, in the case of death of a Deputy, Senator or public servant, the full pension the dead person would have got had he or she retired would be payable to the widow for a minimum period of five years and thereafter for five years at three-quarter pay. It would a phased form of severance so that there would not be a dramatic loss of standard of living. It is an appalling gap and should be addressed without delay.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very complicated. One would need about 12 other Bills at hand for cross-reference and it is just not feasible. We do not have the time or the staff to do this. The Minister of State said that section 18 enables the allowance to be taken into account for severance payment purposes. I think this is the allowance payable to the Attorney General but why are those severance arrangements not applied to chairmen, vice-chairmen and convenors of committees of the House? We are the only ones to whom this has not been applied and it should be applied to us. I understood that an amendment would be brought forward to address that issue and I am disappointed not to see it. The Minister of State should clarify this.</P>
    <P>There is an arrangement for a special payment to a former Taoiseach who has not reached 55 years. That is interesting. It is not just to suit the present Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, who is not yet 55 but coming up to 50 but is this a portent of the result of the next election? Are we making provision for a lump sum for Deputy Ahern? I say so facetiously as he is entitled to it if he ceases to be Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions relating to postal facilities and I wonder about those. We are removing the requirement that the use of postal facilities should be for parliamentary duties only, which opens up the possibility of abuse. What is the purpose of this provision? I have been in the Dáil for almost quarter of a century and I have no doubt as to what I can use parliamentary post for. It is for communicating with Departments of State, with constituents or others who write to me <Col N="422" /> in my capacity as a Deputy or shadow Minister or for use when engaged in correspondence related to those duties or representation of one's constituency. It is not for Members to seek support by giving free envelopes to groups in their constituency which have nothing to do with parliamentary duties. This is going on and it should not. There will be occasions when a secretary paying a bill will put payment into an Oireachtas envelope by mistake but that is not systematic or deliberate abuse, it is an oversight. However, here is a danger that we are opening the door to possibly serious abuse and I suggest that provision be deleted. We should extend the reference from parliamentary duties to parliamentary or connected duties which would qualify in the mind of a reasonable person. I have reservations about deleting the term parliamentary duties from section 33 and do not think the Minister of State was right in his speech. I agree that the present description of what postal facilities may be used for is a bit tight and could be opened up a little but I would be happy with a change from parliamentary duties to parliamentary or connected duties.</P>
    <P>It has been my experience regarding the postal facilities, particularly in recent years, that there can be significant delays in the delivery of Oireachtas post. There is a high incidence of these letters going missing or not being delivered. In my organisation and those of other constituencies there are constant rows about people not getting notices in time for meetings. Our rules require that people get four full days written notice. The notice may be sent out seven days in advance but it may not arrive until a day or two in advance or even after the meeting. It ends up with secretaries being accused of not sending the notice in time. Likewise, letters are sent from Leinster House on a Wednesday, in the expectation that they would be delivered by Friday, but are not delivered until Monday or Tuesday. I believe there is a case for taking the word &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; off the envelopes and perhaps a franking system should be put in place. I have inquired of friends of mine who are postmen, and they admit that there are other postmen who, when they see &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; on the envelope, will throw them into a corner. We have had discussions over the years with An Post and there is a significant problem. I have discussed this with the Minister for Public Enterprise and the board of An Post to see how we can ensure that parliamentary post is treated with at least the same priority as normal post.</P>
    <P>When we come to Committee Stage I will ask the Minister to give us the current allowances payable rather than allowances from a previous date. In section 6, &ldquo;the Chairman of Seanad Éireann is entitled to be paid a salary at the rate of £22,518 per year&rdquo;. Why is the salary of the Chairman of the Seanad not the same as that of a parliamentary secretary? I would have thought that the chairman should at least get the same salary as a Minister of State. I notice that the pro<Col N="423" /> posed salary for the Leader of the Seanad is backdated to 17 September 1997, at £7,213 per year. I presume this is updated to at least the equivalent of the chairman of a committee. Why is the leader of the Opposition in the Seanad not provided for? He is uniquely left out.</P>
    <P>Section 10 inserts a new section 11 in the Oireachtas (Miscellaneous Provisions) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1996. Subsection (2) of the new section states that &ldquo;An order under this section may, if so expressed, have retrospective effect&rdquo;. I would like the Minister to tell us what retrospective effect it is proposed to have. Under section 12(<i>a</i>)(5A)(<i>b</i>) a Member will have to hold the position of Tánaiste for three years to get a Tánaiste's pension. Once again, this is a unique provision. If a Deputy is a Minister for two years he or she is entitled to a pension. If the Taoiseach holds office for only a day he gets a Taoiseach's pension. Why are we discriminating against the Tánaiste? The words &ldquo;for a period of not less than 3 years&rdquo; should be deleted. Why should someone who has been a Tánaiste for one or two years not get a Tánaiste's pension?</P>
    <P>One would need a degree in algebra to understand the formulae in some of the following sections, so I will not tax myself by asking about it. Section 19 deals with new arrangements for the office of Taoiseach. I am not objecting to this but I would like to have the exact changes spelled out. Section 24 deals with the pay levels of Deputies, which do not correspond to the payment which we currently get because they have been updated. I will be asking for the up-to-date figure in each case. It is proposed in section 26, paragraph 3D that a person who is a member of Dáil Éireann on the day it is dissolved gets one eighteenth of the salary. Why are they not paid until election day?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions the possibility of a consolidated Bill, but it will not be published yet. I think it should be a task commenced by the Department to have one consolidated Bill dealing with all aspects. Perhaps it should be done in conjunction with the Oireachtas Commission Bill, which I hope will be introduced in time to allow a vesting day of 1 January 2002. As a Deputy, it is hard to know exactly what one is entitled to, or from whom one finds what one is entitled to. There is a myriad of different allowances under different headings. Personally, I do not know what I am paid. One is paid by cheque. Sometimes one makes claims and does not get paid, and only discovers that months later. One does not know who to go to. Maybe Deputies could get a table to say what allowances they are entitled to, so that they can have a clearer picture.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and pay tribute to the Minister for Finance. He recognises that Parliament, and Members, have to be properly resourced and he has not been afraid to take the decisions to bring this forward. The commentary in the newspapers, when Deputies got even a general pay <Col N="424" /> increase, used to be anti-politician. That now seems to have stopped. The newspapers now seem to realise the need to resource parliamentarians properly. This Bill has taken courage on the Minister's part. It is something on which I completely agree with him. My views are spelled out in the Fine Gael policy document A Democratic Revolution in which we forcefully argue for the proper resourcing of these House and their Members. We still have some way to go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly believe that politics and Parliament need to be properly resourced and that people who make the system work, whether they be secretaries or staff in this House, Deputies or Ministers, need to be properly remunerated. They often have not been in the past, and I will return to that general argument later.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I want to voice concern about aspects and individual provisions of the Bill. I do not agree with the provision for long-service increments for Deputies. The new provisions which we are making for pensions are pushing it a bit. The plethora of positions which we have created which are remunerated by salaries or allowances for people who service committees is excessive. My fundamental belief is that we should be paid as Deputies and that the basic salary should be a good one. I do not think that we should be seeking to create various allowances, which no one, including Members of the House, understands, to make up for the basic salary which in the past has not been great.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that in the recent past, and arguably even now, the basic salary for a Deputy, and certainly that of Ministers, is not brilliant. The fact that the Taoiseach will be paid in the region of £100,000 when this Bill is passed is not flattering. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister of State and even Opposition spokespersons deal on a regular basis with captains of industry who are frequently paid multiples of that amount to run medium-sized companies. That the Taoiseach is required to give almost every hour of the day to running a country for a significantly lower amount is something on which we should reflect. We have nothing to apologise for either as TDs or as office holders in the case of the Minister of State when we examine the basic salary we receive.</P>
      <P>Contributing to a debate of this nature makes me uneasy because we are being asked to do something which is unfair, which is to assess critically our worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The review body did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We can do it in two ways &ndash; as trade unionists seeking the best possible deal for members or by detaching ourselves from the scheme and looking on it as outsiders. I will try to do a bit of both but probably more the former than the latter. I accept what the Minister of State said, that the review group recommended the <Col N="425" /> basic and more important provisions in the Bill, but some of the other provisions were not recommended or even considered by the review group.</P>
      <P>It is right that we should pitch the basic salary of a TD at a Civil Service grade, and principal officer is the right one. I am not sure whether it should be the standard grade two or the higher grade one of the Department of Finance principal officer. A case could be made for pitching it at the higher level.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill which makes explicit increases in the basic salary of TDs and office holders in line with Civil Service increases. Those have been determined by and large by partnership agreements and it is right and would be understood and appreciated by the public that TDs should receive increases automatically in line with what other public servants receive. Most of us are frustrated that the increases which will occur incrementally in the next 18 months have been reported three or four times in the past year in the press creating the public impression that we have received much greater and many more increases than we will. I welcome that we are providing for an easily understood system of automatic increases in line with the rest of the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>We must make the case to the public why TDs and office holders should be well remunerated. There is the value of the work we do but the case should also be made that people who seek to be and are elected to the House suffer a considerable opportunity cost. In many cases they will lose their jobs, in others, they will at best stand still in terms of promotional possibilities in the job they held, and in others where they are professionals, they will be required to neglect their profession or stop practising. There is a cost in terms of job opportunities outside the House for people who take up positions as TDs and office holders, frequently for a relatively short period.</P>
      <P>It struck me within a few days of being elected to the House when speaking to people who had been TDs for a long time that there is one thing almost all of us have in common, which is insecurity. I remember speaking to someone who had been a Member for 15 to 20 years and being amazed at what appeared to be a completely unjustified insecurity in terms of his confidence in holding his seat <i>ad infinitum</i>. Unfortunately, in the case in question, the lack of confidence and insecurity was subsequently justified by the 1997 general election. We are all subject to the will of the electorate and can lose our jobs and salary at very short notice. It is right the remuneration we receive should reflect that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a difficulty with the provision for long service increments. The provision in money terms is not generous. It is about £1,300 after seven years' service and much the same after ten. The value to TDs of these increments is relatively slight. I have a problem with the principle. I do not see that colleagues who effectively do the same job should be paid differently. There are two colleagues in my constituency who have been <Col N="426" /> in office longer than I have been and one who has been in office the same length of time. Without wishing to reflect positively or negatively on them, I do not see that those of us who attend the same public meetings and do much the same work should be paid differently. To turn it around, if we attend these public meetings, I do not see why the representatives of one section of the audience should be paid more than the representatives of another section. If I vote for TD &lsquo;A', I expect him to be paid the same as TD &lsquo;B' for whom my neighbour votes. I do not accept the principle that there is a difference in what we do.</P>
    <P>Speaking from experience, it does not necessarily follow that people who have been Members for longer do the job any better. People who have been Members for longer manage to glide in a way people who have been Members for a relatively short period do not. I am not sure it can be said the normal considerations in terms of experience which might apply to jobs elsewhere in the public service necessarily apply within the House.</P>
    <P>I have a problem with the pension provisions. To reduce the hurdle from three years to two and to provide for a 20% pension after two years is pushing it. There is a case for examining the pension system as it applies to office holders and TDs generally. There is an argument for the sound trade union principle that all service should be reckonable and should be related to the pay one receives at the time. Perhaps we should examine the integration of the general pension system for TDs with that of office holders rather than operating what are effectively two different systems.</P>
    <P>When considering the issues in the Bill, we must reflect on others who make politics work, namely, the staff of the House and the staff who work for and with us. I cannot help reflecting on the fact that while, thanks to the Minister we have made progress in obtaining remuneration which reflects the job we do, our staff have not been as fortunate and have not been looked on as fortunately by the Minister. The secretarial assistants in the House do enormously valuable work and frequently work long hours. They certainly must have skills which the average secretary outside the House would not require. They need to be able to deal with queries on the phone or in person and with political propaganda and literature, and to be able to do a great deal of work on computers by maintaining databases and so on. They do a great deal of work, frequently over long hours, which is above and beyond normal secretarial duties. It is unacceptable that they should be required to work on the level of pay they receive. That is something which has been crying out for reform and change for many years. It is acknowledged by almost everyone in the House and yet we have been singularly unsuccessful in managing to progress that issue. It is unfinished business in the programme of modernisation of the workings of the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> The pension system for secretarial assistants is arcane and beyond belief. Perhaps when it was introduced about 20 years ago it was not expected that people would stay working as secretarial assistants for many years. The scheme is extraordinarily ungenerous in comparison with other pension schemes. People can work for 20 or 30 years and still receive a very small percentage of their salaries when they retire.</P>
    <P>One significant change in the workings of the House has been the committees. They have been a positive development. Their streamlining after the previous election has worked in that specific committees deal with specific Departments. However, we should not create salaried positions for or give allowances to people who serve on these committees. If I chair six, eight or nine committee meetings a year, I do not see that as taxing me unduly as a Member. There are many other Members who do a great deal more work as spokespersons or otherwise. I cannot help but voice the suspicion that what we have done is create positions which are intended as a sort of condolence to those who have not managed to achieve ministerial office, and I am not sure we should be in that business. The basic salary should be good and should include chairing the odd committee. I have great difficulty with the notion that we should make committee allowances pensionable.</P>
    <P>A couple of other issues were raised during the Minister of State's speech to which Deputy Mitchell referred, one of which related to postal facilities. I have doubts about this issue because I do not think Members of the House should give free postal facilities such as envelopes to groups which may be agitating within their constituency or groups which may be organising work nationally, whether political or otherwise. This facility which is given to individuals should be used in connection with their Dáil activities. We all use the envelopes for party political activities, which is perfectly reasonable. However, it should not extend to those allowing others to use the facilities given to Dáil Deputies. I support what Deputy Mitchell said in that regard. Perhaps the Minister of State will give this matter further consideration.</P>
    <P>On the overall cost of the package, it is normal practice in explanatory memoranda to set out the cost to the Exchequer. I am, therefore, interested in knowing what the cost is.</P>
    <P>I support the general principle that we must remunerate properly those who make politics work. Politics is important and democracy needs to be paid for out of public funds. If we do not do that, we will be handing it over to private interests or those who can afford to do it, something we should not countenance. I am not sure that providing for a plethora of allowances which no one understands is the way to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Deenihan.</P>
      <P>I welcome the major aspects of the Bill. On this occasion I disagree with Deputy McDowell in regard to the concept of incremental increases which I always thought should be in place in this House. This concept is in place outside the House in almost every walk of life. It should also apply here. I do not say this because it suits me personally, it is something I have believed since I first came to the House a while ago. As Deputy McDowell said, it is not a huge increase, and by the time it is taxed it will be worth much less. However, the principle is right.</P>
      <P>In so far as the basic salary of Deputies is concerned &ndash; I have not spoken publicly about this issue for many years &ndash; we should not be ashamed to say that we should be paid a particular rate for doing a particular job. I am aware we do not evaluate our work and that this was done by the review body. The expertise of many other groups in society is also called upon. This does not just apply to politicians. It is true to say that for many years politicians were paid peanuts. For a time in the 1970s and during the early 1980s, almost any other career yielded a better financial return than being a Member of this House. Some politicians are afraid to speak out in this regard. When politicians were put on the same salary scale as principal officers there was a fair amount of talk throughout the country. Many local radio stations and newspapers rightly carried the story. Since then, whenever a Bill goes through the House which has anything to do with politicians' remuneration, people believe it involves an additional increase. However, this is not true because we are talking about the same increase.</P>
      <P>At a more fundamental level, I recall being interviewed when the last increase was agreed. I was asked the straight question did I think we were entitled to be paid. For the 20 years or more since I have been in politics, it is not me who is being paid, it is a workable arrangement between my wife and me. My wife does as much work as I do because that is how it is in rural constituencies. I have no idea how things work in city constituencies. Like me, my wife works each day. Whatever we receive, therefore, must be divided in two. Whether that is a good return for the work of two people is another matter. I am aware many other Deputies are in the same position. Nowadays there are many opportunities for women to work outside the home. I do not know how I could remain in this House if my wife did not help me in regard to constituency work in particular. My remuneration as a Deputy is divided in two and whether that is a good return is debatable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From travelling throughout the country to conventions and so on, it is obvious that there must be some realistic financial return for the huge input if one is to enter politics. No one caught me by the ear and asked me to go into politics. I wanted to do it and enjoy every day I am involved. However, very few people in their twenties and early thirties take a great interest in <Col N="429" /> politics. We must ask the reason this is the case. We never had so many young people coming into the workforce and people were never better educated. There is now a vibrancy in the country which we all admire. In order to have that particular cohort represented in Dáil Éireann, it is important that they begin to play an active part in politics. Until recently no one in their right mind would have given up any professional job to come to this House because they would have lost a huge amount of money. I am aware there is an element of service to the community involved. No matter how cynical people may be, unless one likes this job no money would pay one to be here. It is against that background that I believe Deputies and Senators deserve what they are being paid.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the way in which widows or spouses of deceased Members of this House are treated. Years ago my mother was widowed when her children were very young. For whatever reason, society is not good to widows either in regard to social welfare benefits or under the Bill being debated here. I understand one quarter of the salary of the deceased will be paid to widows by way of pension. Imagine a spouse of a Member of this House with a young family. Until recently a quarter of the salary would have done very little for the person concerned. No matter what is done from a humanitarian point of view, widows should be looked after, whether widows of Dáil Deputies or otherwise. Generally speaking, widows should be much better looked after.</P>
    <P>I agree that some type of ministerial pension should be available to those who achieve high office. It is a reasonable measure. Will the Minister of State explain the technical point about deductions for pensions after 20 years service? Will the deductions stop after 20 years? How does it relate to incremental increases? This aspect was unclear in the Minister of State's contribution earlier and perhaps he could clarify it for me.</P>
    <P>If a constituent in east Galway writes to me in Leinster House on a Monday, I receive the letter on Tuesday morning without fail. It is an excellent postal service. However, when post is sent from Leinster House in an Oireachtas envelope to east Galway, it can take up to seven days to arrive. I do not know the reason for this and I do not blame anybody for it. However, I hope its slow arrival is not related to the fact that it is sent in an Oireachtas envelope. If that were the case, I would agree with Deputy Mitchell's comment that it might be better if the word &ldquo;Oireachtas&rdquo; were not on the envelope. It is a problem for the postal service but letters reach the capital much quicker than they leave it.</P>

      <P>I referred to the Bill during the debate last night and will expand on some of the points I made then. I welcome the Bill from which I will benefit. It provides the type of financial resources that will make Deputies and Senators more financially independent and more efficient in general. These back-up services are required to enable us provide a better service to our constituents and as legislators. The Bill is timely and I join other Deputies in complimenting the Minister of State and the Minister for Finance for having the courage to introduce proposals to properly resource Deputies.</P>
      <P>I hope some of us will still be Members of the House, but it will particularly benefit the next generation of Deputies in the next Dáil. At least 30% of Deputies do not return to the House after each election as a result of a natural changeover of personnel. Some people lose their seats while others retire. We are preparing the way for Deputies in the next Dáil.</P>

      <P>I hope so. The Bill is most important from the point of view of resourcing politicians properly.</P>
      <P>Part 3 refers to the payment of long-service increments to Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. This provision is most welcome. As a former teacher who was on an incremental scale, I appreciate its value in the context of compensating and rewarding people for their endurance and consistency. People who have been here for a long time will benefit more than new Members. Older Deputies have been here for many years because of their hard work and the service they provide to their constituents. They have been consistent over the years and should be rewarded for it. I welcome the provision. In many cases, the longer one has been a Member of the House, the more expensive it becomes because of the demands placed on that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the extension of free postal facilities for Members of the Oireachtas. I divide my duties in politics into three areas. As a legislator, I participate in debates on legislation and in the past, I introduced a number of Private Members' Bills on my own initiative. I also participate in discussions on legislation under the committee system. This is one aspect of my work. Deputies are on their own in that regard. Deputy Mitchell said that, over the past five weeks, he has participated in debates on ten Bills without back-up facilities. He is a great parliamentarian, but he would accept that he could do a better job if he had the back-up services available to the Minister. We need more back-up services and expertise to ensure we fulfil our duties as legislators in Opposition in terms of pointing out weaknesses and anomalies in Bills. This is not <Col N="431" /> happening at present and we must admit that, in general, we do not detect everything as matters go through the House.</P>
    <P>In addition to their legislative role, Deputies are also constituency workers. On the basis of my interfacing with the people during the Tipperary South by-election campaign, it is obvious that constituents want to feel they can depend on their local representative. They want a connection with their representative and Deputies in rural constituencies who are under the impression that making contributions in the Dáil is sufficient to ensure their re-election are mistaken. One must be a hardworking constituency person to survive in politics. This takes a great deal of time. It takes many hours of endurance in following up and returning telephone calls and making inquiries. One must consider how a person's problem can be solved within the rules of, for example, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs or the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>This work takes time and there are occasions when, if one follows up a matter diligently, one can ensure it is resolved from within the system that may have refused the issue in the first place. Success in politics is a measure of the time one puts into it. In terms of constituency work, if one wants to be successful, it is most important that a Deputy follows up queries he or she receives. This also ensures that people get a fair deal from the system. However, secretarial back-up is required for this work.</P>
    <P>At present, each Deputy has one secretary. My secretary works in my constituency because I carry a huge constituency work load. However, I also need a secretary in Leinster House. A proposal in that regard will be considered in a Bill that is due to be introduced in October or November. This area is most important. Deputies need secretaries in their constituencies and also in Leinster House to carry out research, handle telephone calls and follow up matters with various Departments. It would make a great deal of sense and cut down on much of the expense in terms of the cost of telephone calls, etc.</P>
    <P>The third aspect is community work. I am involved in 12 different community projects at present. I am chairman of the fund raising committees of three projects, one of which involves an investment of £4 million while another involves investment of £1.5 million. As chairman, I am obliged to deal with correspondence and I am delighted the free postal service is being extended to projects which benefit the community and are for the public good. Until now people who used the postal service for voluntary work were obliged to pay for it themselves and postal costs could mount up over time. Community leadership is an important part of a politician's work. Politicians are needed to drive projects. This is particularly true of my constituency of Kerry North where the once buoyant agricultural economy must now be replaced. Not alone <Col N="432" /> must politicians dream up projects, they must find the funding for them. This small measure will help politicians who use the postal service for genuine community activities.</P>
    <P>But for the American interns who work in the House between September and Christmas and between Christmas and April under the IPA programme, Deputies would have no back-up service. I compliment the IPA on this programme and on the excellent researchers it provides. Several of the projects I have completed since I came into politics would not have been completed, or even started, were it not for American interns. I was recently involved in a project by a great north Kerry writer to reprint a book of poetry, originally printed in 1872. An American intern discovered the book in the National Library and but for her it would never have been discovered. The intern procured the only complete version of the book from Harvard University. Members of the Oireachtas should have researchers to do work of this sort.</P>
    <P>We have taken care of financial resources and supports for Deputies. It is now time to look after our health. The gymnasium which has been proposed by the Minister of State should be installed. If we had proper health facilities people would work harder and survive longer in politics. Politicians would give a much better return to the taxpayer if they were fitter and healthier. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that the gymnasium and other ancillary health facilities are made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>
      <P>I welcome the long service increments which are to be made available to Members of the House and I disagree with Deputy McDowell in relation to them. Deputy McDowell feels it is not fair that one Member should be paid more than another who is doing the same job. This happens in every sector of employment. Teachers, nurses, members of the legal profession and even workers in the private sector are paid increments depending on length of service. As Deputies gain experience they come to know the political system and give a better and more efficient service.</P>
      <P>A Deputy who has served seven years will receive a rise of £25.23p per week and if he is lucky enough to survive a further three years he will receive a further increment of £25.23p. It would be a joke to say we are talking about huge sums of money. The increments are worthwhile and their introduction is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pensions, particularly for widows, are important. The average service of Members of this House is 11 years. Members who have served 11 years are entitled to a pension of 11 fortieths &ndash; about a quarter &ndash; of their salary. The widow of a former Member is entitled to half his pension so that widows of former Members receive, on average, one eighth of the Member's salary. This is a very small amount. All of us who are active <Col N="433" /> in politics know the important role played by spouses in political life. They are, in many cases, as busy as we are. Widows are not as well looked after as they should be.</P>
    <P>I support the points made by Deputy Mitchell regarding severance pay. These matters need to be addressed. I hope the Minister of State will be able to do that, perhaps by way of regulation at a later date.</P>

This is another example of the two tier society which the Government fosters at every opportunity.</P>
      <P>While I am in favour of pensions I wish to see decent pensions for everyone in our society. Why are Ministers and Members of the Oireachtas entitled to more favourable pension arrangements than, for example, clerical officers in the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>I will make sure that is done. There has been a delay in the legislation. We are combining the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum under one office. In conjunction with the social partners it made more sense to have them combined with the new National Centre for Partnership and Performance. We consulted IBEC and ICTU and that delayed matters. There is no reason it cannot all be dealt with in the autumn session.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, 28 June, the British Prime Minister and I met the leaders of the pro-Agreement parties in Hillsborough. We had valuable exchanges during those discussions, which were frank and at times forceful.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, Mr. Trimble resigned as First Minister with effect from 1 July. The process is now at an extremely difficult and sensitive stage. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland are maintaining contact with the parties this week. I will meet the British Prime Minister tonight in Downing Street and full-scale and intensive negotiations will get under way next week under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister and me.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that it has not been possible to achieve more progress on the four outstanding issues over past weeks. We remain determined to bring these issues to closure at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The people in both parts of the island endorsed the Agreement, and it is clear that it continues to command the support of the great majority, North and South. Our task now is to ensure that across the range of issues the Agreement is fully and faithfully implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>A meeting which is described by the Taoiseach as frank and forceful does not seem like a productive meeting. I continue to wish the Taoiseach well at his meetings in the coming week. I wish to explore a number of the issues with him. Does he envisage, in certain circumstances, an Assembly election taking place in Northern Ireland in the early autumn? If not, what are the mechanisms within the Agreement which can be invoked to either obviate that situa<Col N="437" /> tion or to defer an election, if an election is deemed to be necessary, once the situation of not having a First Minister lasts for over six weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At last Thursday's discussion it was agreed that both Governments and all the pro-Agreement parties would begin full scale intensive negotiations at an early stage. I suppose that was the area of agreement. We have to get down to that now. In answer to the second question, it seems to us and all my colleagues who have been involved at official level that we have a limited window within which to resolve the outstanding issues. The issues have not changed. We need to develop, if we can, a comprehensive agreement covering all these and then move forward. The British Government and ourselves will meet all the pro-Agreement parties. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and John Reid, Secretary of State, are keeping in touch with them this week at various levels. During the past two weeks we have been looking closely at the Agreement and the legislative position. Nobody has come up with a conclusion other than that if agreement is not reached within the six weeks period there would have to be Assembly elections. The call in regard to the date would come from the Secretary of State, John Reid. The date is not clear but his view, as of last week, was that it would be sometime in September or perhaps it could be delayed for a few weeks. There does not seem to be any way around the call that it would mean full Assembly elections, presumably in late September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explore this issue further? Obviously if there is an agreement, a First Minister, either the same or another, could be reinstated and there would be no need for an election. If the Executive or the Assembly were suspended, would that obviate the need for an election? If a review was undertaken, along the lines of the review of the Good Friday Agreement conducted under the chairmanship of Senator Mitchell, would that obviate the need for an election? Is the Taoiseach saying that while the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has the right to select the date of the election, that he is legally obliged to have the election and cannot defer it indefinitely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last time, the British Government suspended the Executive and the institutions. It is different this time. The First Minister has resigned and, consequently, the Deputy First Minister can stay in office for only a six week period. Everything hinges on whether there is substantial progress. If there is substantial progress, perhaps the review process could operate, as it did before. If progress is not likely, I believe the British Government would not take the position of just suspending everything. That would create its own political difficulties, as happened the last time. To avoid that position, the Secretary of State would not want a review which was not <Col N="438" /> likely to lead to an outcome. He would consider the options and we would be part of the process but he would have to come to a final conclusion. I do not believe the British Government would wish to fold the institutions entirely on this occasion. In the absence of substantive progress, I cannot see the Secretary of State making any call other than to move on the Assembly elections in September. While nobody would like that situation, I believe it would have to be the call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share my view that the British Government made the right decision this time in not suspending the institutions and particularly the Assembly, following David Trimble's resignation? Does he also agree that, politically, a space has been created within the objective framework of the agreement to which the majority of people on this island signed up, including the overwhelming republican population? Does he agree the onus now falls on Sinn Féin and its associated paramilitary wing, the Provisional IRA, to move decisively to break the impasse, not within the framework of a set of conditions and deadlines imposed by one political body or another, such as the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party or the British Government but at the behest of all who voted for the Good Friday Agreement? Does he agree that if they could now make such a move, on their own terms, within the context of the decommissioning framework as set out in the agreement and with the de Chastelain Commission, this would, in itself, be a very positive move which would in turn enable substantial movement to be made on the other three outstanding issues, the stability of the institutions and the questions of policing and demilitarisation? In that context, if the Taoiseach agrees with that analysis, does he consider that we on this side of the Border could have a role to play and that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, if reconvened, could address the issues which are now at an impasse and provide an opportunity to express our views directly to the players involved, leaving them in no doubt about the views of all parties represented in this House on the desirability of moving forward? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn on his first question. It was the Irish Government's wish last time and this time that the British Government should not suspend the institutions. That created unnecessary difficulties and was not favoured by the British Prime Minister on this occasion. There is now a short period within which to negotiate a successful position, rather than simply reflecting on the issues as we have been doing for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into detail on last week's events, Deputy Noonan's quotation of my comments was a fair interpretation of the discussions. I would like to say I could see light in those discussions but I did not. The various positions were put forward but, unfortunately, they were not compatible, or even nearly compatible, on more than one <Col N="439" /> issue. The only agreement we can broker is one which is negotiated. It is not a matter of setting aside some issues and starting again or trying to find a new interpretation. We have long passed that stage, after three years and four months work on the same issues, which are not really going to change. Deputy Quinn is right. As I have said many times, there are not only four issues. It may be helpful to categorise them for the benefit of the House and the public record. This House is, hopefully, at one on these issues and I appreciate the support of the leaders in Opposition on these matters.</P>
    <P>In the first category, there is the update of the Good Friday Agreement and the current position on all its aspects, including equality issues, human rights issues and confidence building measures, some of which are fully implemented, some partially implemented and some well advanced. There an audit of those. They are substantive. Enormous progress has been made, although everything has not been concluded. There is a legislative base and other matters are progressing. On the criminal justice aspect, some issues have still to come forward.</P>
    <P>In the second category, there are four outstanding issues which are not dependent on each other and are not linked together in real terms in the agreement. In the environment of our negotiations, the British Government may have more leverage than the Irish Government on some issues, but I take the position that we are equal partners and try to negotiate on that basis. The four issues comprise policing, demilitarisation, decommissioning or putting arms beyond use in a satisfactory way and the stability of the institutions. In reality, we are unlikely to get agreement on any of them unless we get progress on all of them. The position of some items may vary on different agendas. The policing issue is very much driven by the SDLP. They still have reservations and want to see the British Government from where the legislation ended last year. Decommissioning is, of course, an issue for all the paramilitary groups but there is a particular focus on the Sinn Féin negotiating position and the IRA's position. We are talking about all arms and General John de Chastelain was very careful, in his report of last Monday, to stress that his remit related to all arms held by paramilitaries. On demilitarisation, much progress has been made and more needs to be made. In the real world of negotiations, my leverage on that issue will be effective only if the British Government gets a response. Whether we like it or not, that is the reality and it will not change.</P>
    <P>With regard to the stability of the institutions, what happened last October was unfortunate. Effectively, the First Minister used a device within the Agreement to act as he did. People should not have been suspended, having been democratically elected under the d'Hondt mechanism, the system on which everybody had agreed. We have to try to avoid this happening <Col N="440" /> again to either of the Ministers concerned, Martin McGuinness and Báirbre de Brún. We need a fixed position on the stability of the institutions, to avoid different interpretations being taken.</P>
    <P>Those are the issues. As Deputy Quinn rightly said, we cannot resolve them unless we get some way of negotiating. If each party sticks inflexibly to its own position, the situation cannot be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Taoiseach has urged the republican movement, now more than ever, to make a move on decommissioning, a matter on which I agree with him. In the context of the report of General de Chastelain, and given that it deals with all paramilitaries, has the Taoiseach taken note of the UVF position, namely, that it will not disarm until it knows the IRA's plans and has a declaration from the Provisionals that the war is over? Can the Taoiseach say if in his contacts with the republican movement he has heard it clearly stated that the war is over? Can he bring that to the discussions with those who represent the UVF, namely, that more has been said than the UVF realises and that the language rather than the words used implies the war is over? It is important that a breakthrough is made on the loyalist side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked at these words very carefully, as words are very important. The Deputy knows the report states the UVF will not consider decommissioning before it knows the IRA's intention and hears a declaration that the war is over. It is not one or other, but both elements. The position at that end is very positive. We must always be fair and balanced in these issues.</P>
      <P>The IRA said in its statement of 6 May 2000 and in other statements that it believes we have moved to a whole new dimension, that it is no threat to the ceasefire, something it recently restated, or more importantly the peace process. It has said it is committed to putting arms fully and completely beyond use in a way that is fully verifiable by John de Chastelain and to the satisfaction of the public at large, something it has reiterated. It has also stated it will communicate and deal with John de Chastelain and his colleagues, and has done so, particularly since April. There have been a number of lengthy meetings. The IRA has also accepted the remit of General John de Chastelain. Legislation was passed here and in Westminster. The idea of decommissioning legislation was not new, and people knew it was in place for a purpose. At one time I raised the idea of schemes, that perhaps we did not have to stick totally to the legislation, that there could be other ways of doing things, something which is still on the agenda. Perhaps there are other things which could be done. As of now, the position is that decommissioning will happen but it is not likely to be now. The Unionist position is that this issue is of immense importance to them: it is their number one item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> Policing is also a big issue for Unionists. We have continually argued for change in this context. The Government's position has been that we cannot make progress on policing and will not get people to join the police in the way we would like unless the Bill is satisfactory and close to the Patten report. To be frank, I would like it to go beyond the report as we always saw it as a compromise. The SDLP has put forward a long list of issues in this regard, as has Sinn Féin, and the matter is still unresolved. We are unlikely to reach any position unless there is movement on all fronts. I cannot say that even if there was clearance on decommissioning, the issue of policing would be sorted out very quickly &ndash; I do not think it would be that easy. However, a major breakthrough on any of the issues would help the overall climate for negotiations. As long as everybody sits on a position &ndash; everybody is doing so &ndash; and says that is their final position, progress cannot be made. The Unionists will certainly not agree with the Sinn Féin position as they believe Sinn Féin must secure more progress from the IRA. Sinn Féin states it cannot do this. The SDLP states the current position regarding policing is totally unsatisfactory. In these circumstances the institutions are totally unstable.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues which must be dealt with and on which we must try to move the parties, something we have not succeeded in doing since March. That is the dilemma we face. We must continue to see what progress can be made.</P>
    <P>Regarding positive news, I detected in the talks last week that people did not think we should throw the entire process aside. They did not add much to help, but the British Prime Minister and I detected the fact that people wanted to find a solution. Therefore, it is worth everybody's time to make one last attempt at it, and put in the effort to try to achieve it. So much has already been achieved. The climate has been good in recent years. I remember answering questions in the House in December 1997, when I said it was with great regret that we did not make the progress during that Christmas break we were meant to make &ndash; I repeated this as the talks last week. There was a change in the last 48 hours of those talks, which effectively broke down at Christmas 1997. The Dáil adjourned the same day. The Official Report shows that I said it was very dangerous because every time we allowed a void in the political process people got killed. I repeated that last week and we know what has happened since, with two men being shot dead. It would appear that in both cases the shootings were sectarian. An unfortunate Nationalist on his way to work in an engineering firm while waiting at a bus stop shortly after 7 a.m. was blown away. This always happens. It seems to me &ndash; it may not seem so to everybody else &ndash;  that it is far better spending time negotiating than creating a vacuum. We should not allow a vacuum to develop, as happened in 1997 at Christmas, a time of goodwill, when 11 people were shot. It would <Col N="442" /> be extremely dangerous to allow a vacuum to develop at this time. Posturing, not playing one's last card or sitting on the fence is a dangerous business and not what I want to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly the Taoiseach would agree that a collapse of the peace process is beyond contemplation and not an option. The Taoiseach referred to tragic incidents which have happened in the recent past. Is he aware that this morning loyalist paramilitaries carried out the sectarian killing of yet another 19 year old Catholic man, Ciaran Cummings, in Antrim? This follows the shooting dead of another man, John McCormick, in Coleraine, on 23 June, and the serious wounding of another man in Belfast on 27 June. This is against the backdrop of the ongoing efforts to prevent Catholic schoolchildren from attending school in north Belfast, and the burning of several Catholic churches. Does the Taoiseach realise &ndash; I say this very carefully &ndash; that there is deep anger, not only among republicans, but among a growing number of Nationalists not only in the Six Counties but throughout the whole island, that at a time when peace is being violated daily by armed loyalism, almost the entire party political and media focus &ndash; certainly the focus of Deputy Quinn of the Labour Party &ndash; is on the silent and inspected weapons of the IRA?</P>
      <P>As a representative of Sinn Féin, a party that has fulfilled its obligations under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, including the decommissioning section, I urge the Taoiseach to ask the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, to fulfil his obligations including demilitarisation and the introduction of a new, acceptable police service. I strongly disagree with the Taoiseach's belief that he can be a neutral broker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in the House would express their utter revulsion at the vicious and cowardly murder of Ciaran Cummings in Antrim and equally condemn the other murders and violence &ndash; I am aware that many incidents are going unreported. There are problems in both communities &ndash; thankfully not killings, and there are problems along the peace line, which we also condemn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House has been extremely balanced in what it said on all these matters, and supportive of what I have said. Everybody acknowledges that progress that has been made and that there are four outstanding issues. The arms are beyond use because those that have been inspected on three occasions have not been used. On the other side there are commitments which have been entered into by the British Government, with which I have no difficulty. Deputy Ó Caoláin and his party know that I argued for those that have been removed so far and am currently seeking the removal of others. Agreements have been made, deadlines put down and legislation has been passed here, setting up the schemes. We have <Col N="443" /> supported an independent international commission on decommissioning with eminent world figures on it. We have set down achievements that we want to reach &ndash; that the arms will be put beyond use in a verifiable way. How this is done is not an issue for us in this House &ndash; we will support it even if it is not strictly according to the legislation &ndash; if other innovative ways are found.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Ó Caoláin understands me even if he does not agree with me. I cannot get the British Government to move on demilitarisation unless I get moving on decommissioning. It is not a question of me being more than an honest broker &ndash; I could go into the talks any day and lecture the various parties, but that would not achieve anything. I am trying to achieve the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement because that is the job I have to do by virtue of the overwhelming vote of the people. I have to implement it fairly and cannot reinterpret or renegotiate it. I ask the Deputy and his colleagues to understand this.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the statement from the IRA on 6 May last year was very helpful in that it stated among other things that the ceasefire or the peace process were not under threat and that they would engage with General de Chastelain to put arms beyond use? Does the Taoiseach further agree that the main obstacle to successful negotiation is the fact that the engagement with General de Chastelain has not led to putting the arms beyond use, or indeed to making any progress since 6 May last year to the end of June this year ? Will the Taoiseach comment on the views attributed to Seamus Mallon, that under certain circumstances, Sinn Féin should be excluded from the executive, and that if they were to be excluded the onus would be on the two Governments to initiate the action to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Seamus Mallon said that this is one of the considerations &ndash; he was not recommending it, but said it may come up. As I said on Monday, that issue should be considered at the end and not the beginning of these negotiations &ndash; and Seamus Mallon would agree with this approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to frame the progress that has been made as positively as I can. We have the IRA statement from 6 May last year that arms will be put beyond use in a verifiable way that is satisfactory to the public and that they will engage with the independent commission. There have been inspections by Martti Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa &ndash; and that is to be welcomed. I consider <Col N="444" /> those arms to be beyond use because they have been inspected and are being reinspected and there is no indication that will not continue.</P>
    <P>All of those things are positive, but the reality is that we have to move to a position that complies with the implementation of the legislation. There has been re-engagement since April. It appears to me that the IRA took the view that certain issues which they expected to arise out of the 6 May statement did not happen in May and June. The British Government contests that view and insists it fulfilled its obligations. There is no use arguing about it, but both sides have different points of view and these issues have to come back into the current negotiations &ndash; which brings us back to demilitarisation and decommissioning. It does not really matter what the delays and difficulties were, we are still in the same position. I could negotiate substantial movement on these matters &ndash; I might prove to be unsuccessful &ndash; but I believe I could get considerable progress on demilitarisation if I could get progress on decommissioning. If that happened it would not solve the policing issue, but would put it in a different light and we would be able to make progress. The issue of policing is sometimes under-estimated, but at least if we could make progress on other matters then we could deal with the stability of the institutions &ndash; which is irritating, and particularly so for the people who are suspended.  Progress on one issue will assist the others, but progress will not be made if everybody sticks.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since our meeting last Thursday along with our officials, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, there has been a great deal of contact trying to establish a framework that we could use as a basis for this discussion for next week. Tonight, that is what we will work on to see if we can develop a framework taking the Good Friday <Col N="445" /> Agreement from where it is now into a negotiating position with the parties for next week to see what progress we can make. There are no surprises in that &ndash; they are all the same issue. Maybe there are nuances to reflect discussions and meetings that have taken place, but nothing that is not clearly in the public domain.</P>
      <P>It is my view and that of the Prime Minister that other than getting into a round of long, protracted negotiations in an effort to try to make progress, there is no other way. Effectively, we have been at this since 8 March. The election, needless to say, interfered with it. The parties agreed even though these are the two difficult weeks of the year with the marching season, 12 July, Drumcree Sunday and all of those issues, that it was still important that we should do it during this period. It will take a matter of a few days. The issues have been so well debated, it is a question of whether we can get movement. I cannot see new light being shed on the issues &ndash; it is really whether people are prepared to move.</P>
      <P>On policing, there is some clear discussion. There have been meetings between the parties and the Secretary of State. There have been meetings between the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell and the parties. Other dialogue is going on. Tonight, we will try to put all of that together and then try to arrange a meeting with the parties for the weekend.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach join me in welcoming the clear statement made by Deputy Ó Caoláin on behalf of Sinn Féin that it would regard the falling of the institutions as a major mistake, calamity or tragedy &ndash; I am not exactly sure what precise word the Deputy used &ndash; and as something to be avoided? Will he agree that all the parties in this House, certainly the Labour Party, have condemned violence and paramilitary activity from whatever quarter? However, it is Sinn Féin which is linked to the IRA that is in Government in Northern Ireland. The onus of making the next leap falls on that party given its links with the IRA. There is no longer a question of an imposition of a deadline by David Trimble or the British Government but the requirement from all the people represented in this Parliament that some imaginative breakthrough be made this side of the end of the six weeks so as to avoid the possibility of an election, which would have to flow under the legal structures underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and the Assembly, that in all probability, would lead to an outcome that would be more hard-line on both sides and, therefore, make the coming together of a new Executive all the more difficult. It is incumbent on all of us in this House, in so far as we have influence, to become &ndash; to borrow a phrase from another time &ndash;&ldquo;persuaders&rdquo; of those people who have key cards in their hands to move to the point where the four issues the Taoiseach identified can be unravelled and resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Quinn said &ndash; we have to try to be persuaders. The issues have been well and truly spoken of and documented. The Deputy was correct in his analysis. The only point on which I would probably disagree with him is in regard to going to the end of six weeks. I know he is not making that as a core point, but I would consider it very dangerous as that would open up the scenario and we would see the kind of terrible things we have seen today. Moving now is far better. Otherwise the scene will just unravel.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Quinn's analysis of what will happen afterwards, what he envisages is inevitable because the parties will move to an election and there will be a hard line position. The Ulster Unionist Party will be forced into a hard line position, as will others. On the other hand, a very closely balanced Executive has done very good work. It has not actually worked as it was configured because the DUP did not turn up and did not work in collective responsibility. Others were suspended from the North-South element of the Executive and there were a number of other difficulties. However, those difficulties apart, the Executive worked relatively well and has the capacity to work better. Everybody in this House would want to see that happen.</P>
      <P>I met all the parties recently except the DUP, but I understand it is its view as well that it does not want to see the institutions fall. There is agreement on one thing and I am very happy about that. We need agreement on a few other things, or at least partial agreement. Nobody is being asked to surrender anything. All that people are being asked to do in the best terms of negotiated agreement of the Good Friday Agreement, is to help to move the Agreement to its full implementation. I know everything was not clearly written in the Good Friday Agreement. If it had been, there never would have been agreement on that either. The intention was clear enough. People on all sides, using their imagination and their best efforts, even if it is difficult for them, can make this work, otherwise we will be dealing with the fall-out for a long time.</P>

        <b>:</b> How does the Taoiseach explain that the peace process has also been a process of sectarian polarisation, and that unfortunately, there is more division now in the physical distribution of the communities than <Col N="447" /> probably at any time in the past and low intensity territorial warfare is going on daily? On reflection, does the Taoiseach agree the Good Friday Agreement institutionalised sectarian divisions in its structures and we are seeing this mirrored politically across the North, including in the recent elections? Does he agree there is a need for a new non-sectarian political force which would give an alternative to the increasing number of people in the North who are disgusted at, for example, the sectarian atrocity this morning and the sectarian excesses which accompany the marching season each summer?</P>

      <P>In his discussions with the Prime Minister, will the Taoiseach use this opportunity to prevail on him to ensure the information demanded by Mr. Justice Barron, who is chairing the Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings, is provided as soon as possible? It is a source of major concern to those involved that there seems to be a slowdown in the provision of this information. This would be an ideal opportunity to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking Deputy Deenihan's question first, both the Opposition parties and the Government were canvassed by the relatives. I raised it with the Prime Minister Mr. Blair last week and the previous week with the Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid. I asked them to try to remove whatever difficulties there are in regard to that information which is causing upset and annoyance to Mr. Justice Barron, not to mention the relatives, which we fully understand. I will mention it again tonight, although I mentioned it last week.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Higgins's point, I am certain it is not correct. At this time of the year, one witnesses the sectarian divide. Maybe there is polarisation on some issues but in an enormous amount of areas, there is not. There is a huge amount of co-operation across the divide and people working at community level. Former paramilitaries are attempting to calm the situation and contact lines have been established to address these matters. There is an enormous level of co-operation on North-South issues. Even as compared with last year, the political parties, including those which in the past had paramilitary connections, are making huge efforts. During the riots last week, the problems experienced in the Ardoyne area and other recent difficulties, political representatives sought to resolve the difficulties within their communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the level of violence seems to increase dramatically at this time of the year, it is only a fraction of that which prevailed in the past. In a recent speech, Mr. Ken Maginnis stated that the current level of violence represents only 3% of the violence which occurred a few years ago. We should avoid only seeing the dark side of what is happening. Tensions remain in the North. Deputy Quinn was correct when he stated there would be <Col N="448" /> a return to polarised positions if this falls. This would pose a terrible dilemma as it would result in an election based on polarised and hard line positions contested by people who genuinely tried to make the Agreement work. I accept that all party leaders are making efforts but some are in a better position to do so than others. There must be give and take. That is the order of negotiations; if there is no give and take, it is impossible to negotiate.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the cost of supporting through direct provision the welfare needs of persons who are waiting for their refugee applications to be determined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the cost to which the Deputy refers is the cost of supplementary welfare allowance payments made to asylum seekers whose basic needs are met through the direct provision system. The main objective of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to make up the difference between a person's needs and their means, whether in cash or in kind. Where a person has access to certain resources in kind or in cash, through the social welfare system or otherwise, the relevant legislation requires that this be taken into account in determining entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>This occurs in the case of asylum seekers in direct provision who are being provided with full board accommodation, all meals and other services. In such cases, the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per child to provide for personal requisites. Where there are other reasonable expenses, exceptional needs payments are made by the health boards.</P>
      <P>There are currently approximately 2,825 households comprising 3,391 adults and 833 children in direct provision. The cost of weekly supplementary welfare allowance payments to this number of people is just under £3 million for a full year. In addition, exceptional needs payments are also usually paid to asylum seekers on arrival in Ireland. The average payment during the first six months of 2001 was £77, with a total of just under £338,000. The total value during 2001 is expected to be less than £700,000. Further exceptional needs payments may be made when the people concerned enter direct provision accommodation. However, such payments are not recorded as a separate category and their total value is not known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, therefore, the total cost of social <Col N="449" /> welfare payments made to asylum seekers in direct provision is of the order of £4 million per annum. The cost of the other aspects of direct provision such as accommodation, meals and services is considerably more than this. These costs are met by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has responsibility for the direct provision scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister's Department has spent £4 million on catering for the needs of asylum seekers, will he outline his view on whether people seeking asylum here should be entitled to work after six months?

As Minister with direct responsibility for the provision of benefit payments, what is the Minister's view? </P>

      <P>Yes. The question of whether asylum seekers should be entitled to work is not directly within my remit. Some £4 million has been spent overall in the area of direct provision but this does not take into account the additional costs under my Department's Vote which we estimate will be in the region of £57 million overall for this year, including the £4 million.</P>

      <P>The Minister previously informed the House that he considers employment to be the route out of poverty and social exclusion. The Irish Refugee Council recently issued a recommendation on the need to allow asylum seekers to work. People who have been in Ireland for more than six months and are awaiting determination of their applications cannot work. Why does the Minister support a system which provides an umbilical cord between asylum seekers and social welfare dependency?

      <P>It is our policy that asylum seekers should be allowed to work. The Minister is <Col N="450" /> clearly not up to speed on this issue. The European Commission supports the view that asylum seekers whose applications are not determined within six months should be entitled to work. This is the subject of a draft directive. In the light of his laudable comments on unemployment and the need to move people away from social welfare dependency and social exclusion into mainstream society, will the Minister get off the fence and outline his personal view on whether these people should be entitled to work? Will he practice what he preaches? Does he really support the totalitarian notions emanating from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this issue since 1999? </P>

We cannot, nor will we, rewrite rules in this area. Each asylum seeker is entitled to have his or her application determined according to the international rules of asylum. The Deputy referred to a draft directive which is not yet law. An effort was made to allow certain asylum seekers to work here but the Government's position remains unchanged.</P>

      <P>Following agreement at Cabinet yesterday, I propose to publish the Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 2001, probably around 17 July. One of the key features of this Bill is the provision of a legislative framework for the introduction and regulation of a new savings vehicle, the personal retirement savings account &ndash; PRSA, draft details of which I published on 12 April. PRSAs were recommended by the Pensions Board in its report on the national pensions policy initiative as a vehicle to facilitate increased savings for pensions and extend supplementary pensions coverage overall, especially to people who have no such cover at present. The ultimate objective is that some 70% of the workforce, aged over 30, would have supplementary pension provision. It is up to all the social partners to play their part in achieving this target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the trends in supplementary pensions coverage will be monitored by my Department in consultation with the Pensions Board, allowing the role of PRSAs to be evalu<Col N="451" /> ated and further action, if necessary, to be taken. I should point out that the Government has already taken action and made significant progress on a number of pension issues including the establishment of a pensions reserve fund to partly offset the future cost of pensions. The significant increases in the rate of social welfare pensions over the past four years demonstrates that the position of pensioners is very much a priority of this Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill which is complex also includes provision for the establishment of a pensions ombudsman.</P>

      <P>I have three brief questions. The Labour Party and I suppose the rest of the Opposition are bitterly disappointed that we have reached the end of this session, and concieveably the end of this Dáil, without sight of the pensions Bill. Will the Minister agree this perhaps was the primary responsibility he had, but he has not delivered on it? All we got was a briefing on PRSAs a few months ago. Will he agree that a serious deficiency under his administration is that he did not deliver on the pensions Bill?</P>
      <P>Does he agree with my colleague, the vice-president of SIPTU, Jack O'Connor, who said at the recent SIPTU conference that perhaps up to 65% of workers in the private sector do not have an occupational pension? He will be aware that the great growth in jobs as a result of the economic boom in recent years has been in the private sector, therefore, we are talking about hundreds of thousands of workers not having an occupational pension. What does he propose to do about that before his administration ends?</P>
      <P>Will he agree that there is a growing band of pensioners waiting in the long grass for him, the Taoiseach and this Administration? I am talking about secondary teachers, taxi men and pensioners such as those from the Irish Press group, the Ford motor company, about whom we have all been circulated in recent months, and Tara Mines, health board ancillary staff, nurses, teachers, Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and I could go on. There is a major problem in pension provision here. The Minister has had four years and one month to address that, but he has not delivered and people are now left in a difficult position.</P>

My primary responsibility is to deliver social welfare payments to more than 850,000 people per week.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to Mr. <Col N="452" /> O'Connor, who is part of the trade union movement represented on NIPPI and who was part of the process that was the genesis for this legislation. The trade union movement had the ability to influence decisions on this, which I understand were quite significant, as were those of representatives of employers and others on NIPPI. What we are bringing forward in the coming week is the fruit of the work of those in the trade union movement, such as Mr. O'Connor and others, yet the Deputy is using him, to a certain extent, as a critique of what is being done here. Historically there has been a low level of pension cover here and that is the reason we are bringing forward this legislation. This Government is doing that.

      <P>We are grateful for the PRSAs. Sections 91 to 120 of the Bill show how complex it is. Would it not have been better to have introduced this Bill two years ago? At that time the Minister would have had two years to do that. He has now had four years to do this. Why was there such a delay? The Bill will be published during the summer recess to enable the Minister's PR machine to spoof about what is being done while we, on this side of the House, know nothing has been done.</P>
      <P>Every time we met the Pensions Board at the Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs, we heard that the key new development required was a pensions ombudsman. When pensioners such as those from Tara Mines or Ford company contact us they nearly always want to know what is happening regarding the pension surplus and why their pensions are not indexed. If investments are doing very well, why is the money not being transferred to the pensioners? Why did the Mnister not at least bring forward a short Bill to establish a pensions ombudsman? He could have done that, but he did not.</P>

      <P>The Bill will include provision for the establishment of a pensions ombudsman. The Deputy should not hoodwink the pensioners he meets because legislation cannot be implemented retrospectively. The various schemes to which he referred are subject to contract law. Passing legislation today would not rewrite a contract that was made between workers and trustees. The Deputy should not hoodwink those people.</P>

      <P>Staff of the Department may avail of child care facilities in the Civil Service crèche, located in Mount Street, Dublin. Parents pay a weekly fee of £85.00 per child. A second Civil Service crèche, based in Marlborough Street, is expected to open in autumn 2001.</P>
      <P>A crèche is to be provided in the planned Northside Civil Centre at Coolock, which is due for completion in autumn 2002. This centre will replace Gardiner Street local office and integrates certain other State services. This crèche will cater for 25 children of the staff working in the centre and provide short-term care for up to 20 children of the customers using the centre.</P>
      <P>As part of the Government's policy on the provision of child care, an allocation of £10 million capital over two years for the provision of 15 crèches for civil servants throughout the country was announced in Budget 2000. Following on this announcement, I understand discussions took place between the Department of Finance and Civil Service unions in relation to the structures necessary to oversee a major expansion of child care facilities of this nature. Arising from these discussions, it was agreed centrally that a new Civil Service Childcare Agency would be established to promote and manage Civil Service crèches.</P>
      <P>In this context, my Department has undertaken a survey of its employees to assess the level of interest among staff in availing of Civil Service child care facilities and the preferred nature and location of such facilities. My Department is currently liaising with the Department of Finance, with a view to submitting a proposal for funding under the allocation announced in the budget. It should be noted, however, that on the basis of the survey undertaken, the level of interest among staff appears to be very low, with only 155 staff, which represents about 3.5% of all employees, from about 16 different locations, expressing interest.</P>

      <P>My question was the total number of places the Minister has provided since he came to office. He is the leading Minister in a Department of 4,500 people with more than 200 offices throughout the country. Is he admitting to the House that he has yet to provide one child <Col N="454" /> care place in any of the social welfare offices locally, nationally or regionally? Will he agree he has a brass neck to come in here and admit that, given that he and his Government colleagues continuously lecture and hector the private sector about its responsibilities to provide child care facilities and crèche facilities when the public sector has done nothing to do so over the past two years? Is this not another example of the way in which the Government's approach to child care is in complete tatters with no Minister leading the issue in any of the on line Departments?</P>

Can the Minister explain how many crèches, child care facilities or after school facilities he will directly provide as a result of the £10 million announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget?

      <P>The contract under which An Post supplies payments delivery services to my Department reached the end of its term on 31 December 1999. The Government had previously decided that the term of this contract should be extended for a further three years, 2000 to 2002 inclusive. Certain legal issues regarding the extension of the contract have been raised with the EU Commission by a third party. In accordance with its usual practice in these matters, the Commission referred these complaints to my Department for its observations. Responses to complaints, and the complex legal issues upon which they are based, have been sent to the Commission. I understand the Commission is currently examining the arguments advanced by the <Col N="456" /> complainant and the observations supplied by my Department.</P>
      <P>The necessity to address and resolve the issues raised with the EU Commission has delayed the completion of a new contract with An Post. In the meantime, recognising that the payment delivery service which An Post provides to my Department's customers must continue without interruption, my Department and An Post have agreed that the company will continue to provide these services on an interim basis. The Commission has been notified accordingly.</P>
      <P>I have already reiterated the Government's commitment to maintain a network of post offices. While not wishing to pre-empt the outcome of the issues being considered by the EU Commission, I am confident that An Post will continue to have an important role in the delivery of services for my Department.</P>

      <P>What are the Minister's views on the future of the contract his Department has with An Post, given that a group recently found that An Post's network was technically insolvent and will quickly become bankrupt without a change in funding? Some 55 post offices have closed in recent months and elderly people have to travel further and further for post office services. The Minister's Department is the biggest client of An Post, with a contract worth £35 million in 1999.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister support the establishment of a universal bank service for social welfare claimants similar to one planned in Britain and delivered through a network of local post offices? What approach is his Department taking on that? What is his approach? What are the views of the Minister's representatives on the interdepartmental committee? What ideas is he putting forward so that these local post offices can be kept open and the funding resolved?</P>

      <P>My Department is represented on the interdepartmental working group chaired by the Department of Public Enterprise. It is looking at recommendations on how the network of post offices can be put on a sound business footing. There is no doubt that if An Post lost the social welfare contract there would be severe financial implications. We tend to be positive and it is Government policy to work with An Post to ensure the delivery of social welfare services continues to be operated through An Post's counter division. It is generally accepted that people like the social interaction of going into a post office and I assure the Deputy we will do everything we can on this side of the House to ensure the relationship between An Post and the delivery of social welfare will continue and that An Post will continue to play a very important role in this regard for years to come.</P>

She said so in the House recently and referred to what the Consignia was doing in the UK to save local post offices. Does the Minister have an opinion on this? Does he support it? Is his Department pushing for this sort of scheme on the interdepartmental group? Can he clarify his approach and views on this? Does he support this kind of approach?</P>

      <P>Obviously the deliberations of the working group based on what the Flynn report had to say are still at issue and under discussion. I fully agree with the sentiments of the Minister for Public Enterprise regarding the possible involvement of the banks. I, no more than anyone else who uses the banks, have a sense of frustration with the way some banks are closing facilities and ceasing services in some existing facilities. This will create an opportunity for an organisation like An Post and I would like to think An Post will be able to rise to the challenge. That is why the Government made decisions some time back to give An Post extra business in relation to bill collection and so on. I assure the Deputy that every avenue is being looked at to improve the relationship with An Post in order to deliver the service people want on their doorsteps as well as providing An Post with a firm financial footing.</P>

      <P>At present there are 100,710 people in receipt of a widow or widower's (contributory) pension. Of these, 34,124 are aged under 66 and 66,586 are aged over 66. Age 66 is regarded as the standard qualifying age for pension purposes under the social welfare system. The current arrangements, whereby increased payments are generally made to those over 66 years of age, reflect the Government's commitment to our older people. Accordingly, there is a <Col N="458" /> higher payment to those in receipt of the widow or widower's (contributory) pension who are aged over 66. In line with the Government's commitment to pensioners and as announced in budget 2001, I decided to increase the widow and widower's (contributory) pension rate for recipients aged over 66 to the full old age (contributory) pension rate over two budgets. The special increase of £12.90 per week which came into effect in April was the first step in this process.</P>
      <P>The maximum rate of widow and widower's (contributory) pension is now £102 per week for those aged over 66. The current maximum rate of payment for those aged under 66 is £89.10 per week. Significant extra resources are being allocated to improving the position of pensioners. In addition, the Government is committed to improving the position of all other welfare recipients, particularly those with children. The Government is committed to dramatically increasing child benefit by £1 billion over the next three years. In budget 2001 I provided for an increase of £25 per month for each of the first and second children and £30 per month for each of the third and subsequent children. These increases came into effect in June of this year, three months earlier than normal, and will be of major benefit to the 8,900 people aged under 66 who have children and are in receipt a widow or widower's contributory pension.</P>
      <P>In budget 2000 I introduced the widowed parent's grant to provide additional support to those with children, for the difficult time immediately after a bereavement. This grant of £1,000 is payable in addition to the bereavement grant of £500 and other after-death payment arrangements.</P>

The level of payments to widowed people will be examined in the context of that working group. I understand the group is aiming to conclude its deliberations at the end of this month and I believe the final report will be presented shortly thereafter. Social welfare provision for widowed people will be kept under review in the context of overall budgetary considerations.</P>

        <b>:</b> I thank the Minister for the first 15 seconds of his answer; the rest of it was irrelevant. Does he accept that a widow who may be in her 30s should get less than a widow in her 70s whose family may be able to look after her, whereas the younger widow has to look after her children?

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do accept that. There seems to be, and there always has been, a view in this <Col N="459" /> House and among politicians that widows need special treatment. What the Deputy suggests in his question is that we should single out, in some way, one section of lone parents and treat them differently from ordinary lone parents or deserted wives with children. It is not legally possible to do that, that is one of the difficulties we have. I have had representations on this from all sides of the House, including my parliamentary party, and it is one of the reasons I introduced the special £1,000 bereavement grant for a widow with children. It has benefited approximately 11,000 people per year since it was introduced.</P>
      <P>While I have some sympathy in this respect, to make a different change regarding an increase in the one parent family payment would cause difficulties elsewhere in the system. It would leave us open to a challenge. We have examined every available way of assisting widows under 66 with children and will continue to do so.</P>

        <b>:</b> Does the Minister accept that even if he increases children's allowances or benefits, the widow looking after young children will not have enough money to cater for their needs? Does he accept that such a widow, as distinct from a widow with no children to look after or whose adult children can look after her, will not have enough money? Does he accept it is time to tackle the legal constraints which prevent basic payments being made to widows under 66 to bring justice to people who are in difficult positions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not only legal constraints. Why should a widow, living side by side with a deserted wife with the same number of children, get more proportionally? That is the difficulty we face. At the same time, the circumstances of the single parenthood of the widow could be more difficult than those of a deserted wife, although that would not be the same in every case. That is why a widow deserves different recognition that other similar family arrangements. Given the fact the Deputies from all sides of the House have made representations in this area, we have looked at this over the past two budgets if not more to see if we could do something different. The best we could come up with was the £1,000 bereavement grant. I can assure the Deputy that it is an issue which we will look at very closely in the run-up to the next budget.</P>

My Department worked at local level with a number of organisations in the voluntary and community sector in preparing the newsletter. The issue of this publication was the main project of our national welfare awareness week, which ran from 18 to 23 June this year. The purpose of the week was to highlight the range of social, community and family services that are available to support people &ldquo;from cradle to grave&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As part of its customer action plan, my Department seeks feedback from customers on a systematic basis on the quality of service to tailor the delivery of services, including information services, to meet their needs. Customer panels and customer surveys are among the mechanisms which are used for this purpose. The findings of these surveys are, in the main, very positive and show a high satisfaction rating with the services provided. Similar feedback will be sought on the <i>Changing for a Changing Ireland</i> publication and the findings will help to improve the overall provision of information to our customers. It is estimated that the costs including design, printing, postage etc. will be approximately £300,000. Some 1.44 million copies were printed, of which 40,000 were in Irish, and they are in the process of being distributed by An Post to every household in the country.</P>

      <P>Over the past four years I have asked the Minister to produce a general information leaflet for households. I commend him on <i>Changing for a Changing Ireland</i>.</P>
      <P>One thing which I found disappointing &ndash; I know the focus was on family and life events &ndash; was its soft focus approach. It was reminiscent of blurbs that came in the past from Departments such as the famous epistle from the former Deputy Ray Burke at the Department of Justice. Why did it not include hard information on all the key schemes and the rates, while still making it readable? As politicians we try to transmit this information to our constituents, but different constituencies do not get that full information. I notice that one of my constituents, Mr. John Finn, is included in it. He has had a remarkable life history.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has to accept that, apart from this booklet, we have put out 530,000 other booklets targeted at different groups. For instance about 350,000 of these booklets were sent to old age pensioners, dealing not only with social welfare issues, but also with tax and health issues. We made a point of using large print and were complimented for that. Much of the print in other documents, like the <i>SW4</i>, would be unreadable for many old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Changing for a Changing Ireland</i> is the first of what I hope will be a number of booklets issued by the Department. We believe it is a good way to disseminate the information. The feedback from the other publications has been excellent and I understand the feedback from this one is in a similar vein. The information is available in the <Col N="462" /> Department's offices. We commissioned the MRBI to conduct a survey recently which showed that 90% of the people who came in contact with our offices were happy with the service they received.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The national action plan sets out the Government's strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion in Ireland for the period 2001 to 2003. The plan covers all the relevant policy areas, including the areas for which I have responsibility. Preparation of the plan was co-ordinated by the poverty unit of my Department. It was approved by the Government and submitted to the European Commission by the 1 June deadline.</P>
      <P>The legal basis in the treaty for this process of co-operation among member states is already provided for in Article 137.2, resulting from a proposal for a treaty amendment made by Ireland during the negotiations on the Treaty of Amsterdam. At the European Council in Nice, all member states, including Ireland, agreed to specific objectives to combat poverty and social exclusion which now form the basis for the national action plans. These objectives, however, are separate from the treaty, which was also agreed at the same European Council.</P>
      <P>The national action plans, including that of Ireland, will undergo a co-ordinated process of joint review with other states and the European Commission. This is designed to assist member states in learning from the best practice of other states and, in the light of this, improving their strategy on combating poverty and social exclusion on an ongoing basis. This will be done through the existing Social Protection Committee which comprises representatives of the Social Affairs Ministers of each member state.</P>
      <P>Regardless of the ultimate outcome of the Nice Treaty ratification process, the Social Protection Committee will continue on the existing basis to work closely with both the Employment and Economic Policy Committees to ensure issues such as social exclusion are examined from an economic and social perspective in a balanced and integrated manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Stockholm European Council in March this year, the Taoiseach, together with the other Heads of State and Government, affirmed that &ldquo;the fight against social exclusion is of the utmost importance for the Union&rdquo;. It is the Government's intention that Ireland will be in the forefront of these developments. The national action plans, which will be reviewed every two years, set down strategies for an assault on exclusion which <Col N="464" /> will be a key priority for member states for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept the criticism from the Opposition and many groups that they did not have any consultative role in the formulation of this national action plan? Does he agree the decision on the Nice Treaty by the people allows us the opportunity to emphasise the importance of Parliament and its committees in the consultative process?</P>
      <P>At no stage was this plan debated in the House or at the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs. When we brought this to the Minister's attention, he refused to provide for an hour's debate on it. Is this not a further example of the erosion of Parliament in debating important matters which will come to the attention of the European Commission?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister say conclusively that the result of the Nice Treaty does not have any impact on the status of his action plan which he sent to the Commission on 1 June given that, when he mentioned the establishment of the plan some months ago, he referred to the treaty negotiations in Nice last December as being the brainchild for this action plan?</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is subject to a means test and is not ordinarily payable to people in full-time employment. However, arrangements have been in place for some years now to enable rent or mortgage interest supplement recipients to retain their housing supplement as an in-work benefit on taking up employment, subject to a gross household income limit of £250 per week and certain other conditions. The conditions for retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements, including the income limits and the ceilings on the amounts payable, were reviewed in consultation with the social partners under Partnership 2000. The main objective was to address poverty and employment traps faced by people making the transition from unemployment to work.</P>
      <P>Following those discussions, substantial improvements in the conditions for the retention of rent-mortgage interest supplement were introduced on 6 April 2000. The £250 per month limit on the amount of rent supplement payable was abolished and the sharp withdrawal of support at the end of the third year was removed, the supplement now being withdrawn on a tapered basis over a four year period, i.e., 75% in year one, 50% in year two, 25% in year three and 25% in year four. The conditions for receiving and retaining rent or mortgage interest supplement will be further examined as part of the review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance. The new scheme will be operated by the local authorities. <Col N="467" /> One of the objectives of the new scheme will be to ensure that a full range of housing options is available to people with long-term housing needs, including those who are renting in the private rented sector and who currently rely on supplementary welfare allowance, rent supplement. In that regard, I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will be bringing detailed proposals to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister recognise that many lone parents are finding it virtually impossible to get back to work given that if their income goes over a certain threshold they automatically lose part of their SWA rent allowance? Will he ensure people are informed that such a situation may exist before they apply for the job? Will he also give an undertaking that whatever measures are brought forward by the Government to assist these people in terms of additional rent assistance, they will be brought forward speedily and that the current transfer from the health boards to local governments throughout the country is one of the reasons the scheme has not been successful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the scheme has not been successful because it is and has worked well. As I said previously, while the number of recipients has not increased dramatically in recent years, the amount of money has, obviously because of the increase in rents. As a result of trying to get lone parents in particular into work and take away some of the disincentives in that regard, I introduced the fairly major change of abolishing the limit of £250 and increased the tapering. This has big advantages. Obviously there will be situations whereby the more people earn the more they will lose out, which will always be the case.</P>
      <P>I will continue to monitor this aspect but, as far as I am concerned, the changes I made in April 2000 have worked reasonably well.</P>

      <P>As on Committee Stage, I intend to deal with the proposed amendments together as they relate to the same issue.</P>
      <P>These sections provide that investigations or inquiries into accidents which occur in the workplace, or involving marine related activities at adventure centres, can only be undertaken by the authority where the consent of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is obtained, together with the consent of any other Minister as he or she considers appropriate. This is to ensure that while the authority may conduct such investigations, there will be no duplication of work with the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, commonly known as the Health and Safety Authority, or the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.</P>
      <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that these bodies would be considered to be the most competent professional authorities in carrying out such investigations. However, where it is agreed that the Adventure Activities Standards Authority can play a role in such investigations, the authority will be empowered to do so. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>The amendment is a standard provision that appears in most legislation. When this amendment was tabled on Committee Stage, the Minister of State sought legal advice which stated that the provision was unnecessary and he stated that he is satisfied with the advice he received. However, the advice I received since Committee Stage differs from the Minister of State's advice and I state that for future reference. The Minister of State has again stated that he is satisfied with his advice. We must agree to differ on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 13, to delete lines 43 to 52 and in page 14, to delete lines 1 and 2.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks the deletion of section 20, which would introduce a charge for the services that will be provided by the proposed adventure activities standards authority. I was not convinced by the Minister of State's comments on Committee Stage on this matter and I refer him to the report of the interdepartmental working group in June 1999. The group made it clear that a large proportion of the enterprises in this sector are well run and have proper regard for the safety of people who use their services. They are involved in what might be called sector or activity associations that seek to lay down standards for their members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action being taken in the Bill, with which I and Deputy Bell agree, was recommended to cover cases where one cannot be sure that level of professional probity is applied by people in the sector. In terms of its effect on the quality of <Col N="471" /> activities in the sector, it will make a material difference to a minority rather than a majority. We could regard the Bill and the establishment of the authority as largely a prudential measure. I realise there are other concerns and the section refers to the fact that it is envisaged that the authority will be involved in education, training and advisory services for people involved in the provision of adventure activities. This is welcome. The Bill also contains a provision that envisages that the authority will be involved in the overall promotion of these types of activities. I have some doubts in that regard, but they are not strong enough to be the basis of an amendment.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a prudential measure in the interest of public health and safety. To all intents and purposes, apart from the establishment of statute law, the Bill will be redundant for a majority of the operators in the sector because the companies and associations concerned already observe high standards, fixed by their own professional or sector bodies. As the State will be involved in this type of back stop measure, section 20 provides for the possibility of imposing a new charge on people for doing what they already do and this is unfair. The Minister of State said on Committee Stage that he considered this authority analogous to the Health and Safety Authority. If I interpreted the Minister of State correctly on Committee Stage, its legislation contains a provision for making charges for services it supplies for which it had not charged previously.</P>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority has a right by statute to make a charge for the services it provides to employers and in the interest of public safety all over the country. However, so far, either the Health and Safety Authority itself or the competent Ministers, or both, have judged such charges unwise, inopportune or unnecessary. The Health and Safety Authority is involved in a much wider range of activities than the proposed authority will be, but, so far, it has decided not to make a charge.</P>
    <P>The annual running costs of the proposed authority are estimated by the Minister of State, as set out in the explanatory memorandum, at approximately £300,000 a year. This is not a very large sum, even for a Government whose predicted surplus for the year has been reduced by up to £0.5 billion. That is another day's work, although it is a big error to make. Nevertheless, it does not concern us directly in this debate.</P>
    <P>The sum of £300,000 a year for the cost of running this authority is a small amount in overall Exchequer terms, but it could be a substantial sum for individual operators in the sector. As it would constitute the possibility of a charge on a majority of operators for doing what they already do in observing the type of standards envisaged, it is unfair, unwise and unwarranted. This is why I propose the deletion of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's reasons for the amendment, which he outlined in detail on Committee Stage. I noted in detail the concerns expressed by other Deputies on Second Stage in relation to the proposed authority being allowed to make charges for the provision of its services. However, little of what I have heard today would encourage me to change my mind. I point out that the provisions of the Bill in this regard are entirely similar to those contained in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which allows the Health and Safety Authority to make such charges as it considers appropriate or necessary.</P>
      <P>By including such an enabling provision in the Bill, the intention is that any charges made by the new authority would be designed to offset administration costs and would not be so prohibitive as to discourage operators from registering with the authority, thereby providing services possibly to young people outside the safeguards of the law. That would be most unwise in itself. The reason for the Bill's introduction should be enough to discourage anybody from going outside the safeguards of the law.</P>
      <P>However, I accept the point made by some Deputies that the Health and Safety Authority does not at present charge for its services. Deputy Dukes referred to this aspect. I can repeat the assurance given to the Deputies on Committee Stage that this principle, and their views on the matter will be considered when the new authority is established and the question of invoking such charges is being addressed in consultation with my Department.</P>
      <P>This is an enabling provision. There is no commitment at this stage that there will be charges. This will be considered when the authority is set up. There may be no charges. It is also possible that charges would be set at a particularly low level. It is important to have this provision in the Bill and, consequently, I do not propose to withdraw the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister of State would, privately, agree with me that the Health and Safety Authority does not impose a charge because it knows there would be widespread objection from trade unions and employers to the imposition of any charge. Although there is an enabling provision in the Safety, Health and Wel<Col N="473" /> fare at Work Act, it will remain a dead letter because there would be a storm of protest if a charge were introduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State talks about the possibility of the charge being a low one on reputable operators in the business, but then he says it would act as a measure to discourage people from operating outside the law. Either the charge will be high enough to discourage people from operating outside the law and therefore a burden on people operating within the law or it will not be a burden and equally not a discouragement. The Minister of State cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>This does not seem to have been a consideration for the Health and Safety Authority. There are employers who operate outside the terms of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act &ndash; cases come before the courts from time to time &ndash; but the Health and Safety Authority has not proposed the imposition of a charge to discourage those people, although it has a statutory right to do so. The Minister of State's logic is flawed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be far more in keeping with what the Minister of State says is his position if he were to agree with my amendments and take the provision for imposing a charge out of the Bill. Should it ever appear to him or to one of his successors that there was a case for making a charge he or she could do so by way of an addition to the Bill when it has been enacted, rather than <Col N="474" /> have the provision in the Bill as it is now, hanging over us like the sword of Damocles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that Deputy Dukes agrees with me. He says it may one day be necessary to have such a charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <P>I see no reason or justification for such a charge and I see no equity in the provision.

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 14, lines 17 and 18, to delete &ldquo;and may be removed from office at any time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 proposes the deletion from the Bill of what seems to me an absolutely extraordinary provision. I propose to delete the provision that the director may be removed from office at any time by the authority with the consent of the Minister. There is no provision for the conditions under which this might be done. It is not stated that the director can be removed from office for stated misbehaviour or for stated reasons or for any of the reasons that are normally given.</P>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage the provision is made even more odd by the fact that subsection (3) provides that the director shall hold office under a contract of service in writing. Subsection (3) states:</P>
      <P>The Director shall hold office under a contract of service in writing containing such terms and conditions . . . as may be approved of by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that if a contract in writing for the employment of a director is worth anything, it should certainly lay down what the authority requires of the director, what kind of performance is required of him and what kind of sanctions are to be envisaged if that director does not live up to those terms. It is in a contract of employment that provision should be made for the conditions under which the person, who is the subject of the contract, may be removed from office. The Minister of State can speak until he is blue in the face and tell me about precedents for this provision in other legislation but he admitted on Committee Stage that there is no precedent for a director having been removed from office under a similar provision without a reason being given. I take the view that the provision in section 21(5) is oppressive, unjust, unnecessary and should be deplored. For that reason I propose its deletion. There are two places in the Bill where this occurs &ndash; that is the reason amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are being debated together. There are two other places where there is a similar provision allowing for the removal from office of any member of the authority. For that reason I have tabled amendments Nos. 10 and 11.</P>
      <P>I see no reason for making this kind of provision. If it is in previous legislation it is an outrage. If provision is to be made to fire the director of an authority such as this and eventually to fire any member of the authority it should be on the basis of reasons that are clear and fair and that will not give rise to unnecessary litigation. If this provision were ever to be used there would be an immediate danger of litigation because it is so uncertain. The reasons that may be used as a justification for this are completely unknowable because this is a totally arbitrary provision. For that reason I propose its deletion.</P>

I pointed out during that debate that I was of the opinion that this subsection was contrary to the Unfair Dismissals Act and that it would open up a serious case in relation to the rights of workers and would create a serious precedent. I had hoped the Minister would have a look at it. I would have grave reservations as to whether it contravenes the Unfair Dismissals Act. I support the points made by Deputy Dukes.</P>

      <P>I intend to deal with the two proposed amendments together as they concern the same issue. As I explained on Committee Stage these are standard enabling provisions which reflect provisions in other similar legislation. This section is similar to section 18 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which provides for the appointment of the director general to the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health &ndash; the National Health Authority &ndash; and to section 7 of the Marine Institute Act, 1991, which provides for the appointment of the chief executive officer to the Marine Institute.</P>
      <P>In 1989 Deputy Dukes was the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and was party to the Tallaght strategy which supported the Government. He helped to put the country on its present footing and I acknowledge that. It is possible that he voted for that Act. What has changed in the meantime apart from the fact that his colleagues thought he was not doing a good job, though I thought he did an excellent job? </P>

      <P>Is the Deputy trying to get back? Does he think Deputy Noonan will lose his job and that there may be a vacancy again? Irrespective of what has caused him to change his mind, he must put these points. He has done so very well. I checked to see if there was any validity in what he said. There is some validity but not sufficient validity to change my mind. I hope this provision will not be invoked. Nevertheless I am advised that such provision is necessary to deal with possible extreme circumstances which would necessitate the removal of directors from the authority. I hope it will not happen but it is possible and one has to accept that. I would not like to see a situation where a director could refuse to step down and there would be no effective way of removing that person from the authority. As this will be a body with primary responsibility for regulating safety in the sector such a situation would severely impact on the credibility of the authority. As the Deputy's amendment would effectively mean that the Minister would be prevented from taking reasonable and responsible action in the event of such a situation occurring, I do not propose to accept the amendments. Removal would only happen in extreme circum<Col N="478" /> stances. The legal advice is that the provision should remain as an enabling provision.</P>

      <P>If I was waiting for the Minister of State to pay me a compliment I would be long dead before I would ever get one. Leaving those considerations aside I am not happy to find that in 1989 a provision like this escaped the scrutiny of the House and that in 1991 a provision like this got through the House without being objected to. We have 12 years experience of the operation of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, without ever having encountered extreme conditions that would give rise to the triggering of the provision in that Act. We have had ten years experience of the operation of the Marine Institute Act, 1991, without there having been circumstances in which this kind of provision in that Act was triggered. I cannot see why the Minister requires an instrument of this kind.</P>
      <P>The previous subsection in this section provides for a contract of service for the director. Any contract of service worth its salt would deal with the circumstances under which a person may be removed from office. If it does not, then the person who drew it up should be fired. The Minister is acting, on bureaucratic advice, in an approach which I can only describe as using belt, braces, safety pin and a piece of twine as well. It is a completely unnecessary and excessively oppressive provision. The fact that it has never been used is an indication of its value. I urge the Minister of State to remove it from the Bill.</P>

In relation to the contract of service, I assume no director will take the job unless he or she is absolutely certain they know where they stand and on what grounds they can be fired. In any court of law, a dismissal from employment would not stand up without the reasons for that course of action being given. Under this legislation, it is difficult to see anybody wanting the job of director without knowing what is in the contract of service.</P>

Section 33(7), as it stands, makes it an offence for an individual to go hill walking without a licence &ndash; and I ask the Minister of State to note this &ndash; punishable by two years in jail. Clearly, this should apply to the operator, not the hill walker. I appeal to the Minister of State to listen to what I have said about this very serious flaw in the Bill. I urge him to accept the amendment. Otherwise, he may be left with a Bill containing a very serious legal flaw. I took a lot of time, effort and discussion on this.

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 22, to delete lines 45 and 46.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 deals with the provision under which the Minister may remove the chairperson of the board from office at any time. Amendment No. 11 deals with a similar provision that the Minister may remove an ordinary member of the authority from office at any time. I remind the Minister of State that ordinary members of the authority, from among whom I understand the chairperson will be appointed, are proposed to be appointed after consultation with various other persons or bodies, including the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the Minister for Education and Science, a member of the staff of the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, national governing bodies for adventure activities, a representative of the staff of adventure activities operators and persons having such knowledge, skills or experience as the Minister considers appropriate. All that consultation will have taken place before the members of the authority are appointed and before they, in turn, elect a chairperson, if I understand the procedure correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see the point of going through the rigmarole of consultation if the Minister can turn around on a whim and simply fire the chairperson and any member of the authority. In normal circumstances people are appointed to such authorities for a term of office, and unless something goes badly wrong with the operation, they remain in office for that period. If the Minister believes there are circumstances in which the chairperson or members of the authority would so misbehave themselves as to merit dismissal, then he should provide for that in the Bill. To provide for a completely arbitrary power for the Minister is unnecessary, very unwise and should be avoided if possible. I see no reason this provision has to be made. Under it the Minister can at any time dismiss the chairperson and any member of the authority. On a whim the Minister could decide he or she did not like the authority and fire everybody on it. Under another provision in the Bill the Minister could also fire the director. This is an extraordinary power to give the Minister and totally unwarranted. The Minister should take his <Col N="481" /> courage and imagination in his hands and accept the amendments on the basis these powers are entirely unnecessary.</P>

      <P>This is a standard provision in legislation of this type, and while I hope it will never have to be invoked, circumstances might arise where it would be necessary to remove the chairperson or an ordinary member from office, particularly if the chairperson or ordinary member would not step down willingly. It would not be appropriate for the Minister to be unable to act in such circumstances, as would be the case if the proposed amendments were accepted. Consequently, I do not propose accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister of State will be sympathetic to this amendment on which I did some research since speaking on the issue on Committee Stage. A Deputy can only be sacked if he serves six months in jail. The Bill proposes that a member be eliminated from the authority if he is imprisoned for one day. Surely, if we, as Deputies, can spend up to six months in jail before being eliminated from the Dáil, a member of an authority, be it this or another authority, should not be eliminated from membership for spending a day in Mountjoy, for what may be a technical matter. It is reasonable that members of such groups should have at least the same facility as Members of the Oireachtas. I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, we are now back on Committee Stage. These are new amendments and require to be recommitted. This is entirely new material being introduced by the Government. I have not had an opportunity to study it and do not know what it is about. The Labour Party takes its responsibilities in respect of legislation very seriously. We believe it is our function, as legislators, to scrutinise the legislation brought before the House by the Government, to propose our own Bills where we believe this is necessary, to critically examine legislation when brought before the House and to take our jobs, as legislators, seriously. I have been a Member of the House for 12 years and during that time I have striven to perform that function as effectively as I could, as have all my colleagues. This evening a book was presented to us with 233 amendments for our consideration. The first six are completely new amendments which require recommittal to Committee Stage. I have not studied these amendments &ndash; and I want to explain to the House why. These amendments were circulated yesterday, through no fault of the House, or the staff of the House, or indeed the Minister's own staff &ndash; it is the fault of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 2.30 p.m. yesterday we had Question Time. I was on duty, as was my colleague, Deputy Mitchell, asking questions of the Minister of State in respect of his responsibilities in the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It is part of our function to make Government and the executive accountable. That was followed by the Order of Business and immediately follow<Col N="483" /> ing that at 4.45 p.m. yesterday we went to the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government to deal with the waste management Bill, which we debated until 10 p.m. We resumed at 10 a.m. today and continued until 2 p.m. At 3 p.m. we had a further meeting of the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government to consider a motion which had been referred to it by the House dealing with the appointment of additional members to An Bord Pleanála. That meeting only finished within the last hour.</P>
    <P>Where in that period of time is an Opposition spokesperson supposed to even read amendments for Report Stage that were circulated yesterday, much less reconcile them with the text of the Bill, get advice on them, consult with different groups who have an interest in this outside of the House and form a view on them? It is not possible. What we are invited to do here this evening is an utter charade as far as parliamentary procedures are concerned. We are being asked to debate 233 amendments, six of them completely new Government amendments, without any opportunity to consider their text or implications.</P>

      <P>They are something about transferring the ownership of Temple Bar. The Minister says it is transferred to Dublin Corporation. I have not had an opportunity to study this &ndash; it is an important matter. As a Member of this House, I am not going to allow myself or my party to be backed into a situation where we are asked to deal with legislation on a wing and a prayer. It is not fair to us as Members of the House, and is not fair to the public we represent.</P>
      <P>Almost three months ago, I stated publicly and in this House that my party would co-operate with the Government in having the local government Bill enacted. The Government has had three months to have a debate in this House on the Bill but chose not to do so. It also chose not to do so on the waste management Bill and the electoral Bill because it decided for strategic political purposes that it would ram these Bills through in the last couple of weeks of the session. It thought the public would not notice what is going on and so it would minimise the amount of embarrassment that this legislation is going to cause for the Government but in the process it is denying to the Opposition our constitutional and legislative right to scrutinise this legislation properly.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> I will not be a party to that. I will not play a part in what is no more than a token nod to parliamentary scrutiny of this legislation.

The Labour Party will not co-operate with this; we have been willing to co-operate with the Government for the last three months in regard to the local government Bill, and when we were concluding Committee Stage last week , I said to the Minister that I had co-operated at Committee Stage to get through the amendments but that I would not tolerate a guillotining of the Report Stage debate, which is what we are getting. Worse than this, we are getting a Report Stage debate set up in such a way that I cannot meaningfully contribute to it because I have not had the time or the opportunity to study the amendments that are before us. I will not participate and I propose to withdraw from the House in protest.</P>

      <P>I concur with what Deputy Gilmore said. It is unconscionable for us to be putting through legislation in this manner. The three Bills that come under the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government have been rammed through. We are almost at the stage now that we do not know what Bill we are talking about, or which position we are taking. We are getting amendments from the Government hot off the press. This 38 page book which was published this morning contains more amendments than there were on Committee Stage. I have been in committee twice today, apart from all my other duties, and have no idea what is being proposed. There are new amendments, some of which I know are a response to ones we put down on Committee Stage, but I do not know for sure as I have not read them.</P>
      <P>This is the most important Bill as far as local government is concerned. It has been three years in gestation and deserves some scrutiny in the House. There was very little in the Bill that was of any value, and what was of value was taken out at the behest of the Independents who have not even had the gumption to come and defend their position. With Deputies Gilmore and Ó Caoláin, I have tried to make something of the Bill by way of amendment &ndash; to try and salvage something for local government in this country. We are not being given the opportunity with two hours left to discuss a book of amendments. There is no opportunity for proper scrutiny or debate on what is being proposed. This legislation will not stand the test of time because it has been rushed through. I am sure the Minister of State is as lacking in familiarity with it as I am and I do not know what contribution we can make to legislation under those conditions.</P>
      <P>At the same time there are important Bills going through that would merit equal attention such as the election or waste management Bills. We put a tax on every individual household&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will return to amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>Temple Bar Properties was founded as a limited company under the Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Act, 1991, to undertake the regeneration and development of the Temple Bar area of Dublin. This development was to take place in the context of a range of tax incentives for residential and commercial projects. The final date by which qualifying development work had to take place was 31 December 1999. Development in the area has also been supported by the provision of direct grants to the amount of £42.77 million, £22.47 million in European Regional Development Fund funding and the balance, £20.29 million, from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>At the time of its establishment, it was considered that a limited company provided the right structure and degree of independence required to ensure the initiatives required to progress the regeneration of the area would be put in place. This proved to be a good decision as the successful development of the area now shows.</P>
      <P>In the period since 1991, considerable development work was undertaken, including the development of residential, retail and commercial units and, perhaps most significantly in the longer-term, the development of a number of purpose designed cultural centres such as the Ark, the film centre and art house. Now that the development of physical infrastructure in the area has been completed, the responsibilities of Temple Bar Properties in the future would be to manage the property portfolio of the company, to develop an administrative and cultural programme for the area and to administer the voluntary contribution paid by local traders in the area to fund the cultural programme. This is not a structured contribution and each trader decides what he or she will contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed amendment of the Temple Bar Area Renewal and Development Act, 1991, will provide for the transfer of the Minister's shareholding to Dublin Corporation, the deletion of certain powers in relation to compulsory purchase orders and guarantee of borrowings by the State and the deletion of powers relating to the audit of the company the Comptroller and Auditor General. The amendment was put forward to give effect to the Government decision to bring Temple Bar Properties Limited under the aegis of Dublin Corporation. The transfer of the ownership to Dublin Corporation is proposed on the basis that the company has completed its major functions as developer for the area and the exercise of its remaining functions would be more appropriately dealt with under the umbrella of the local authority. Currently, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, through his nominee, is the sole shareholder in Temple Bar Properties Limited and, as share<Col N="488" /> holder, appoints the board and chairman of the company.</P>
    <P>Discussions have taken place at the board of Temple Bar Properties Limited, comprising representatives with expertise in arts, culture and commercial fields and on which the Minister and Dublin Corporation are represented, to determine appropriate transfer arrangements. The amendments proposed reflect these discussions.</P>
    <P>There are no implications in relation to pay or conditions of staff employed by the board. Specifically, the new Part 23 of the Bill provides for the transfer of the Minister's shareholding in the company to Dublin Corporation from a date to be decided and the sole shareholding to be held by Dublin Corporation from the date of transfer &ndash; I understand the request for this has come from Dublin Corporation &ndash; the deletion of section 12 and the Third Schedule of the Act of 1991 dealing with the compulsory purchase powers of the company, the powers of Dublin Corporation will be relied on in future should the need arise; the deletion of section 13 dealing with the guarantee by the Minister of borrowings by Temple Bar Properties Limited, future borrowings will now be guaranteed by the State; the deletion of section 14 is consequent on the deletion of section 13 and provides for the removal of the provision enabling the Minister to depend on the central loans fund for the guarantees to which I have referred; and the deletion of 16 dealing with existing provisions in relation to the accounts of the company, in future these will be audited under the companies Acts rather than by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the changes proposed and at this point I should clarify the position under the revised arrangements. Dublin Corporation, through its nominees, will be the sole shareholder in the company. The board and chairman will be appointed by Dublin Corporation as the sole shareholder. The chief executive will continue to be recruited by the board, the staff of Temple Bar Properties will continue to be appointed and employed by the company. Remuneration of the board, chairman, chief executive and staff will continue to be determined, as at present, by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Finance. The company will continue to operate as an independent company with its own staffing structure and, therefore, at arms length from Dublin Corporation. The audit of the company's annual accounts will be carried out under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999, by an auditor to be appointed by the shareholder or nominees.</P>
    <P>It is now appropriate to transfer the major responsibility for the management of the area as a cultural district to Dublin Corporation within whose function and area of Temple Bar is situated. As I have already outlined, the structure of the limited company will be retained to carry out this function, to underline the commitment to the area's distinct character and needs and to maintain the flexibility and expertise of the current <Col N="489" /> arrangements. This proposal reflects the Minister's commitment to strengthening the local government system by devolving functions to local authorities where practical and feasible to do so. In addition, amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment to exclude this Part 23 from being collectively cited with local government Acts. Amendment No. 3, which I will come to later, deals with citations.</P>
    <P>Those opposite criticised the number of Government amendments. A great deal of my amendments are as a result of the Second Stage debate. A great deal of the Opposition's amendments deal with issues that have already been debated and which have been re-entered here. The Second Stage debate took eight hours, which is quite a long period, and a lot of Deputies contributed. The Committee Stage was held over three days. There is no question of the Bill being rushed through. We are on Report Stage where I am seeking to implement any commitments I made and about which I could do something. Many of these amendments are grouped. As Deputies can see, they are similar. The number may seem high but we could accommodate debate if we proceeded expeditiously. I accept it is a difficult task and we should get on with it.</P>

Are rates payable on commercial and retail properties in the Temple Bar area and are there any financial implications for Dublin Corporation as a result of transfer of the company? If so, was this done with the full agreement of Dublin Corporation? Did it hand over the company of its own volition or was this a Government decision?</P>

      <P>The Minister of State indicated in his outline response to our initial questions that the transfer occurred in response to a request from Dublin Corporation. Will he clarify whether he refers to the corporation's executive or whether the decision was democratically made by the corporation's elected members? Is it in the Minister of State's gift to outline the actual effect this will have in terms of the corporation's roles and responsibilities? Are there any anticipated downsides in terms of its new remit? In the absence of the detail essential to make an informed assessment of this proposal, I will record that it is my preference in principle that these areas of responsibility would be under the control of the relevant local authorities. There are many questions which the Minister of State has not addressed and we cannot anticipate all of them in the limited time afforded to us this evening.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 17, line 25, after &ldquo;<i>Part 5</i>&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, <i>section 241</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This group of amendments relate directly or indirectly to various aspects of local electoral law. For purposes of clarity, I would first like to discuss the Government amendments relating to the substitution of a new section 42 &ndash; amendment No. 51 &ndash; and the insertion of a new Schedule 9 &ndash; amendment No. 219. Amendment No. 51 deals with the revised section 42 which, in turn, relates to the new Schedule 9 which deals with certain amendments to the Electoral Acts of 1992 and 1997 and the Litter Pollution Act, 1997. Schedule 9 relates to amendments required primarily to the Electoral Acts, 1992 and 1997, to ensure the more detailed electoral mechanics which currently apply to local elections will apply also to direct elections of the cathaoirleach. Therefore, the amendments which involve the insertion of the words &ldquo;direct election&rdquo; into various electoral provisions will cover such areas as register of electors, polling districts, where two or more polls are held on the same day etc.</P>
      <P>The amendments to the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, set out in part 3 of the new Schedule 9 relate primarily to the inclusion of &ldquo;direct elections&rdquo; in the protection against an offence under the Litter Pollution Act, 1997, for election material, provided it is removed by the sixth day after polling day. It also provides that local authorities' powers to make by-laws prohibiting the distribution of advertising material do not relate to election advertising material for direct elections.</P>
      <P>Given the number of such technical amendments to the electoral code, it was felt that the best approach was to combine all of them and insert them into a separate Schedule. The new Schedule 9 now also contains the provision previously contained in the old section 42 relating to the restriction on a directly elected chair seeking nomination as a Dáil candidate. I note that Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 52 seeks the deletion of that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 53 in Deputy Gilmore's name <Col N="491" /> relates to the question of an elected chair, on being elected to the Dáil, having to stand down or <i>vice versa</i>. These two amendments were discussed on Committee Stage. The Bill, as published, provides that the directly elected chair shall be disqualified from nomination for the Dáil during his or her term of office as chair and for a 12 month period thereafter. Deputy Gilmore's amendment seeks to drop this restriction and provide alternatively that an elected chair, on election to the Dáil, would cease to be chair of the local authority and <i>vice versa</i>. This would have the effect of creating considerable instability in the system.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages of our provisions is that the chair holds office for five years, the full life of the council. This five year term is an important balancing factor in the dynamics between the chair, the council and the manager. The five year term ensures the chair will develop considerable experience and knowledge in his or her role. The Deputy's amendment could result in people using the position of elected chair solely as a platform for election to the Dáil. By leaving before the end of their five year term, they would create instability. The directly elected chair provisions are designed to attract candidates who are willing to give at least five years to local government, thereby forging a greater profile for and interest in local government.</P>
    <P>The amendment also refers to &ldquo;a <i>vice versa </i>situation&rdquo; which I take to mean that a Deputy may be elected as a chair but must cease to be a Deputy upon election. The existing law provides that a Deputy or Senator is disqualified from being elected to the position of chair or from being a chair or vice-chair of a local authority. It is proposed to continue this arrangement. This means, in effect, that a person must choose at an early stage in his or her career whether to pursue his or her career as a cathaoirleach or in national politics. In these circumstances, I ask Deputy Gilmore to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 is a technical amendment to ensure the revised collective citation for the electoral Acts will take account of the new section 241. The new section 241 is set out in amendment No. 213 which provides for an updated reference to the meaning of &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; within the Electoral Act, 1992, which will now be construed by reference to the Local Government Bill. The new Schedule 9 is already covered by virtue of the citation of Part 5.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State agree there is something of an inconsistency in the provision that a directly elected chair cannot seek election to the Dáil unless he or she serves a full five year term when, at the same time, somebody seeking election to the position of chair is not required to be a local authority member for five years? The Minister of State implied that to insert a provision to the effect that people should have five years' experience as local auth<Col N="492" /> ority members would be somewhat unconstitutional. Are we not creating impediments in both cases to people running for public office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe we are. We debated the question of who would be eligible to stand for direct election to the position of cathaoirleach or mayor on Committee Stage. It was decided that anybody entitled to stand for election to a local authority would also be entitled to stand for election to the position of mayor and that no prequalifying conditions would be laid down. It was suggested that people should have five years' experience but that was not adopted. We are now pursuing the democratic option of leaving it open to anyone who wishes to run for election to do so. It is for members of the electorate to decide who to elect. Anyone wishing to stand for election to the position of mayor will be aware in advance that he or she, if elected, will be debarred from election to the Dáil for the five year duration of the mayorship and the following year. This provision is included to facilitate the establishment of this new office and the development of a stronger local government system.</P>

      <P>Any chairman of a local authority can offer himself or herself to be a candidate for election to the Dáil. I do not know why the Minister of State is singling out an elected mayor or chairperson and I do not agree with it. It is superfluous at this stage. Another layer of bureaucracy is being added to what is already there and it will be of no benefit to the local authority. The Minister of State is creating a buffer between the elected members and the management of every council. I do not agree with that. Any chairman of a council or urban district council can offer himself or herself to be a candidate for election to the Dáil, yet the Minister of State is saying that an elected mayor or chairperson of a county council will not be eligible to do that. That is inconsistent, wrong and discriminatory. That person may have served on the local authority for one or two years and made good progress and there is nothing wrong with that person offering himself or herself to be a candidate for election to the Dáil. I do not agree with what the Minister proposes. He should withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is inconsistent because it denies the right of a sitting Cathaoirleach or mayor to offer himself or herself for election to the Oireachtas, and I assume that applies to both Houses. If such a person were to do so, the flaw in this is that it is not accepted that the person would have to forego his or her position of chair or mayor as the case may be. It is wrong to draw a line and say people holding these offices cannot offer themselves for election not only for the five year term of their office but for the subsequent year. That is a further imposition and it seems &ndash; we have touched on this phraseology on several occasions in recent days &ndash; unconstitutional to deny a person the right to offer him<Col N="493" /> self or herself to be a candidate. Someone holding the position of chair or mayor who is subsequently elected to either House of the Oireachtas should relinquish that office. That would be acceptable, but the Minister of State's proposal to exclude people serving at local authority level from moving on to give national service for the term of that person's office and for a further 12 months is punitive, undemocratic and unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about the constitutionality of this proposal.</P>
      <P>The candidacy requirements for the office of directly elected Cathaoirleach of a county or city council was a subject of discussion and proposed amendment on Committee Stage. At the time the Minister, Deputy Smith, was taking the Committee discussion and he indicated he would contact the select committee with regard to advice received from the Attorney General with whom this general matter had been raised on foot of representations from various local government elected organisations, and as we know there are three. I am not sure if they all made representations but I think they did.</P>
      <P>The proposal on which advice was sought involved the question of limiting eligibility of candidacy to those with some prior experience of elected office and the association's suggestion of five years was indicated. The advice received in reply set out clearly the position of the Attorney General conveying &ldquo;his very strong view that the measure proposed is unconstitutional and, accordingly, the Attorney General strongly advises that you do not limit eligibility requirements in the manner proposed&rdquo;. That decided the issue once and for all.</P>
      <P>When one tries to introduce something new, concerns will always be expressed by some people who may not want change. If we aspire to build a strong local government system, we would recognise the system needs major change from top to bottom. Successive Governments during the past 15 years have been making certain changes and this Government has made substantial improvements to the local government system in an attempt to strengthen it.</P>
      <P>The person who will be elected will be a full-time official. He or she will carry out his or her duties on a full-time basis for the full five year term. There will be no other person appointed to that position. That is the terms under which the election will be held.</P>
      <P>Assuming the passing of this legislation into law, these procedures will commence at the time of the next local elections in 2004. Many good citizens are organising themselves to contest those elections and have made known their interest in doing so. That is a good sign because we often hear in such debates of the difficulty of attracting people to participate in public life, in local authority elections or to go forward for the Dáil. This is a healthy sign for local democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> It is hoped the role of elected mayor will evolve over time into one where he or she will have a series of important functions to perform. The executive functions are currently performed by the manager, but in time there will be a sharing of those functions and a stronger local government system will emerge with strong leadership at local level. It is not possible to achieve that if every June someone else is put into the chair and it remains merely a ceremonial office in many cases.</P>
    <P>This is being done with a firm intent. I understand there was a good deal of support for it across the political spectrum, as shown by the number of people who indicated their willingness to go forward for this position, but that is a matter for another day.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;community development' means a process through which local community life is enhanced through the work of a wide range of community based/voluntary organisations engaged in a variety of services and includes a focus on disadvantaged, marginalised communities and an emphasis on capacity-building and anti-poverty work;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a lumpen mass of amendments that requires a number of contributions.</P>
      <P>The Minister undertook on Committee Stage to meet some of the concerns reflected by Members. Amendments Nos. 4, 7 and 8, which I put down on Committee Stage and have tabled here again reflect the failure of the initial Bill as presented on Committee Stage to properly define the critical areas in relation to poverty proofing and social exclusion. The Minister undertook to put down an amendment that would seek to address these under the focus of social inclusion and I accept that amendment No. 9 goes some way to address the areas I had hoped to see dealt with in the Bill. I will withdraw my amendments Nos. 4, 7 and 8 in accepting the Minister of State's amendment No. 9, which addresses social inclusion and the critical areas in terms of marginalised groups and the social, economic and cultural life of local communities.</P>
      <P>Amendments No. 65 and 72 seek to reflect the importance of engagement with communities in the Bill. It is very important, having properly defined our purpose and intent to tackle the needs of the marginalised in society, that we take a pro-active position to creating, where appropriate, structures of participation that maximise engagement with the democratic system. That is what amendment No. 65 seeks to achieve and it should be accepted. Amendment No. 72, proposes to insert:</P>
      <P>f2&gt;(h) the need to tackle social exclusion and poverty . . .</P>
      <P>(<i>i</i>) the need for consultation with service users . . .</P>
      <P>(<i>j</i>)the need to poverty-proof' local authority decisions, policies and programmes at the design and review stages.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I will press the other amendments in my name but am willing to withdraw amendments Nos. 4, 7 and 8 in line with the commitment on Committee Stage, which I welcome in amendment No. 9.</P>

Paragraph (<i>g</i>) of sections 2 and 4 on page 32 of the list of amendments refers to a substitution of the Environmental Protection Act.

      <P>We had a lengthy and valuable debate on Committee Stage regarding the whole area of social inclusion. The Minister put down two amendments to section 66(3)(<i>b</i>) and 68(1)(<i>g</i>) reflecting Government policy on this important issue. However, Opposition Deputies, and Deputy Ó Caoláin in particular, felt there was a real need to include an appropriate definition of social inclusion, a definition which could convey a sense of the issues which it was intended to encapsulate.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to hear the Deputy indicate recognition of the fact that I took heed of what he was saying and I hope he accepts that the definition now proposed to be inserted in amendment No. 9 is an honest and genuine effort to reflect the views they expressed. Definitions are invariably difficult but this definition not only reflects the views of the Deputies concerned, but takes account of the views put forward by specialised bodies such as the Combat Poverty Agency and the Community Workers Co-operative during dialogue with them on the Bill. I had discussions with them on this matter and am satisfied the views of the wider community are represented and I hope the amendment is accepted in that spirit. I think it has been and I thank the Deputy for that. Many of the issues he has raised in the other amendments were raised by the Community Workers Co-operative but from my discussions with them I feel they will be quite pleased with the recognition in this amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 27, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.&ndash;A member of a local authority who is employed in any office or employment shall be entitled to such unpaid leave from the office or employment in question as is necessary to enable him or her to attend meetings of the authority or committees thereof.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the right to leave from employment. I raised this on Committee Stage and it is one of the few issues I felt was really important in local government, which is why I resubmitted it. Some of the fundamental questions to be asked, which are probably even more important than any legislation we are putting through, are where the next generation of councillors is to come from, where they will get the character, nature and enthusiasm for the job and the extent to which they represent the people that elect them. Society has changed so much that the day of the gentleman public representative or the man or woman of means who could afford to engage in local representation almost as a hobby, is long gone. It is becoming increasingly difficult to draw people with the time to give. Involvement <Col N="498" /> in local government takes up considerable time. Virtually no one is unemployed anymore. Many of the self-employed cannot take time off and the sacrifice is too great.</P>
    <P>What really concerns me is the imbalance in representation. There is a huge imbalance &ndash; farmers are very well represented, as are teachers. The rest of the PAYE sector is, however, virtually without representation in both urban and rural authorities. The thousands employed in companies such as Intel, Dell and Hewlett Packard do not feature as local representatives, yet they make up a huge percentage of the population. The very minimum required is to allow them take unpaid leave to perform their functions as local representatives. There is the other area, the remuneration and expenses which should be accorded to public representatives at local level, but I will not get into that. They need to be able to take time off work and not suffer in their jobs as a result or have to take their scant holiday leave. This is an important measure which I will press.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Olivia Mitchell's amendment. It is not beyond the compass of Members in this Chamber to recognise many areas within our respective communities where people are excluded from participation in the democratic process by virtue of their employment. The measures in the Bill that go some way towards a level of remuneration for elected representatives fail to allow for the option of full-time participation. Therefore, the requirement of employment remains critical for anyone who is public spirited enough to offer themselves for elected office.</P>
      <P>This is not the case only in the information technology sector, as alluded to by Deputy Mitchell, but at every level. I would like to see that a young girl at a supermarket checkout, or anyone in any other sector of employment, has sufficient opportunity to participate. One of the critical things that they need is for their employment not to be put at risk. There are many instances that can be quoted where people are excluded by virtue of the conditions of their employment. That is discrimination and a major obstacle to full and open participation in the electoral process. The system, and democracy as a whole, is severely affected as a result.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State, even at this late stage and having heard the arguments on Committee Stage, recognises the import of empowering everyone, without exception, with the opportunity to participate. There will be many other hurdles and difficulties, but one of the critical things which we must first establish is the right of everyone, irrespective of their employment, to take their place before the electorate at all tiers of elected representation. I strongly support the amendment and urge the Minister of State to accept it.</P>

      <P>I fully support what has been said about seeking to attract people to stand for election to their local authority and other elected offices. There is a need to try to find some way around the fact that some people, in certain employments, seem to be debarred from putting their names forward.</P>
      <P>We had a good discussion on this matter on Committee Stage when I indicated that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, had considered the issue of inserting a statutory requirement to provide for time off from employment for local representatives. He was not convinced, however, that was appropriate for legislation as there could be constitutional difficulties with regard to private employers. It is unlikely that they could be compelled to release their staff. The Minister has suggested that the best way to proceed is by agreement. The issue has been raised in a preliminary way in the context of the PPF talks. I know that the Minister intends to pursue it within that context in order that all relevant parties, employers, trade unions and others, are involved. That is the most productive way in which to proceed. The Government has given that commitment and every effort will be made to make progress in that area.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of upstanding citizens who have put themselves out in order to serve their local communities on local authorities. The more of them that can qualify for membership, by ensuring some provision and recognition is made, the more the system will benefit. There is good work being done in strengthening the local authority system. There is a long way to go but these kinds of changes help in accelerating progress in this area. However, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 27, line 10, to delete &ldquo;the disqualifications set out in sections 13 and 14&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section 14 and to the disqualifications set out in section 13&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since section 12 sets out the eligibility requirements for local authority membership, the reference to a disqualification in section 14 is being deleted on the basis that it related to the dual mandate. By coincidence, a reference to the replacement section 14, inserted on Committee Stage, which prohibits multiple membership of local authorities is still required in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 relates to section 13 which, in turn, deals with the disqualification and the consequences of the deletion of section 14. Section 13 lists disqualifications from local authority membership. The reference, subject to section 14(<i>3</i>) in the context of a Minister, Mini<Col N="500" /> ster of State, or the Chairman of the Dáil or Seanad, is no longer required given the deletion of section 14. The reference pointed out that such a disqualification was to be read from 2004, as it simply referred to a Member of the Dáil or Seanad. This must now be deleted to retain the<i> status quo</i>.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to amendment No. 25 which is the hub of the entire Bill. It refers to the famous section 14 deleted on Committee Stage. Only a week prior to that it was the cornerstone of the Bill. It is a vain hope on our part to resubmit the amendment but it is important and everyone involved in local government had pinned their hopes on the measure.</P>
      <P>If we have learned anything during the years, it is that, if we are ever to have truly meaningful local government, we must make the break between central and local government and between their responsibilities, remit and authority. A single mandate is not a solution to the problems of local government. I would have sought a single meaningful mandate but we are not even getting the single mandate, a necessary, albeit insufficient, condition for any improvement in local government.</P>
      <P>To try to hammer back in the cornerstone of the Bill is probably unrealistic at this stage, but we must make our protest known at the way in which the Government sacrificed the future of local government. The only meaningful measure in the Bill which might have made a difference to local government in the long-term was sacrificed at the whim of a few individuals who did not even have the gumption to defend their position in the House.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State consider, even at this late stage, reinstating section 14 as previously envisaged and make the break between central and local government? If we want local government to grow and prosper and act independently, as the Minister of State often says is required of it, it must be let off on its own. Members of local authorities must be allowed make mistakes because it is the only way people will take responsibility.</P>
      <P>The measure is essential for the future of local government and the only thing that made the Bill significant. Everything else underpins what is already in place and, in some cases, will destroy local government. The directly elected mayors will destroy the decision making process in many counties and cities throughout the country. This measure was the one thing on which everyone pinned their hopes. Will the Minister of State reconsider it at this stage?</P>

      <P>Legislative farce was the phrase I used when this decision was first made known to members of the committee and Members of the House. It is strange that three members of parties not in government have tabled an amendment which seeks to reinsert a <Col N="501" /> section that was in the Government's original proposal.</P>
      <P>It is serious that the influence of a small number of Members whose real purpose and intent is questionable has ensured the extraction of one of the key and critical components of the Minister's Bill as originally presented to the House. The effect of this will be far reaching. It will delay and set back in many ways any purposeful attempt at the reform of local government. This key and core value at the heart of the Bill has been extracted leaving us with very hollow legislation.</P>
      <P>There have been substantial changes in local government with the introduction of strategic policy committees, the corporate policy group, and the new style of management which allows for inclusion and access for unelected people to the SPC system. These are innovative, welcome and important. There is no local authority member who does not fully appreciate and understand the new demands on time and the new roles and responsibilities that come with membership of local authorities. We hope this is only the embryonic stage because the Bill does not allow for further empowering of local authority members. We hope that all that is only a beginning.</P>
      <P>Despite this, we will see into perpetuity a situation where members of local government and Members of all parties in both Houses will, by virtue of party pressure, find themselves forced into a situation of dual mandates and against their real intent. The measure in the Bill was the way to deal with this. It was one of the elements about which I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, some time ago and indicated my support. It greatly disappointed me when, under pressure from the so-called independent wing of the Government, this central tenet of the Bill was whipped out from under his nose.</P>
      <P>I join other Members in sending the Minister good wishes for recovery from his current indisposition. I have no doubt that he would be a discomforted Minister in addressing this issue this evening. I strongly recommend the reinsertion of section 14 so that we can have something substantial and substantive to address and to offer local government after these several weeks and months of work.</P>

      <P>Deputies Mitchell and Ó Caoláin seek to reopen the debate on the dual mandate by tabling amendment No. 25. I do not intend to give a lengthy discourse in reply. We dealt with this on Committee Stage when the Deputies were fully informed about the background and the political realities which gave rise to the deletion of that section on Committee Stage. It is realistic to expect that there will be areas or points of disagreement in a Bill of this size and importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are realists. The Government is a coalition Government and the implementation of the joint programme is making good progress as evidenced by the substantial social and economic advances achieved so far. We are supported by four Independent Members who clearly indicated that they <Col N="502" /> are implacably opposed to the ending of the dual mandate. If the Government had persisted with the proposal, it would have resulted in the withdrawal of their support with obvious consequences. The issues had to be weighed up and it was agreed to continue with our joint programme which has delivered so much.</P>
    <P>The Bill is major legislation and underpins new and recent initiatives in local government. The ban on the dual mandate was an important reform, but we must move on and ensure other elements of the local government reform programme are given the opportunity to develop and evolve. As was pointed out by Deputy Ahern on Committee Stage, it is open to all parties in favour of banning the dual mandate to adopt and implement a policy in respect of this matter. The options remain for either parties or individuals to withdraw from local authority positions.</P>
    <P>I understand the elimination of the dual mandate is party policy for all major parties. My party was instrumental in the first moves in this direction by way of the Local Government Act, 1991, which disqualified Ministers and Ministers of State from holding office in local government. One does not achieve all one's political aims. Beidh lá eile ag an bPaorach.</P>

      <P>As the Minister of State said, one does not always achieve one's political objectives. We are in the final 12 months of the full term of the Dáil. To say it was the four Independents who held the Government to check on this issue is to patently peddle half truths. The Government could have faced them down on this issue. This would have been an ideal time to do so had the will been there. I do not believe it was because it was not only the Independents who took that position. It was evident on Second Stage that many of the Minister of State's backbench colleagues were equally intent in their opposition.</P>

      <P>Health issues were debated on a previous occasion, but not much has changed since. In terms of parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health and Children, how does he determine matters of concern in relation to health? I recently tabled a question about respite care places for chronically ill children in the South-Western Area Health Board region, but the Minister could not answer it. He referred it to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and said it was its responsibility to answer it. How does he determine policy if he does not know the position with regard to such cases?</P>
      <P>The Minister does not appear to know that, despite the demand for it, there are no facilities for chronically ill children in the South-Western Area Health Board region. Representations have been made to me about this issue by district nurses who visit houses and see such children and wonder what can be done for them. How can the Minister make decisions on such matters if he does not have the facts in his Department? This applies to every other area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeatedly table parliamentary questions about orthodontic treatment, but the Minister's response is to refer me to the regional health authority or the South-Western Area Health Board. It annoys me that he does not know about the health matters of concern to ordinary people. Children become teenagers and then adults while they wait for orthodontic treatment that is never available. The Minister obviously is not aware of this problem. If he was aware of it, he would be able to answer parliamentary questions. He would not have to refer them to health boards and I would not have to wait for replies on behalf of unfortunate individuals who were examined when they were primary school pupils, but still <Col N="504" /> have not received treatment by the time they go onto second level.</P>
    <P>Private orthodontic treatment is being sought because structures are not in place to facilitate unfortunate individuals who need such treatment. This problem also applies to chronically ill children because facilities are not available for them. The Department has no means of knowing what is wrong on the ground because matters are referred to health boards. As a result, policy makers in the Department of Health and Children are not aware of the problems. It will not be possible to deal with the demands within the health system if the necessary hands on approach is not taken.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I raised the issue of senior citizens. In the context of senior citizens in accident and emergency departments, I said a system should be put in place that shows what beds are available in the catchment area. This would allow beds in hospitals to be released. However, nothing has been done in that regard to facilitate the people concerned and ensure it is no longer necessary for patients to remain on trolleys in hospitals.</P>
    <P>A hands on approach must be taken. However, if the Minister is depending on health boards to supply information, there is a gap in the basic structure required in this regard. I ask him to address this problem urgently in order that his Department and officials know what is happening and it is not necessary for him to refer every question to the various health boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always had a passionate interest in the provision of an equitable and efficient health care service. I am not ashamed to state that my family depended on a medical card, but I am gutted about how useless it is now. It is a passport to second-class treatment. Thousands are left waiting because they are medical card holders. Anybody whose bank balance allows him or her to pay for private health care can get immediate access to the treatment he or she requires. This is not good enough.</P>
      <P>It is evident that the health care system is in crisis. We did not need a by-election to discover this; we have been saying it for the past two years. The symptoms are everywhere if one cares to look. For example, there are staff shortages. People at all levels must work in difficult conditions in the hospital in Mullingar &ndash; we are still waiting for phase 2B to open after almost five years. Doctors and nurses are faced with cramped wards which makes it more onerous for people already overstretched and doing their professional best in difficult and overcrowded conditions. I commend them for their professionalism and competency in such trying conditions. They must be applauded, but they and their patients deserve better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waiting lists are increasing to a huge degree. Private medicine is booming as a result of inadequacies in the public system, which is suffering from a lack of resources and poor management. Ireland has a system where patients with private <Col N="505" /> insurance get preferential access to health care, while those without such insurance are covered by the GMS or medical card. They are left waiting in an extended queue. Only 6% of our GDP is spent on health, compared to an average of 8% in other EU and OECD countries.</P>
    <P>A young child from Newbridge, featured on television tonight, waited eight years for corrective eye surgery. There are waiting lists throughout the country. For example, in County Westmeath and the Midland Health Board area, 26,000 are waiting for treatment. Some 43% of adults are waiting more than 12 months while 74% of children are waiting more than six months. Some 4,500 are waiting for ENT services while 3,500 are waiting for orthopaedic services. Do people realise that the longer one is left waiting, the more debilitated one becomes? This particularly applies to old people.</P>
    <P>In the Midland Health Board area, the orthopaedic centre in Tullamore will close for six weeks at the height of this problem. I am aware of the case of a woman who has waited two years for a knee replacement operation. She was ready to go into hospital, but was distraught when she was informed that she could not have the surgery. She is now wondering if she could get immediate access if she got £4,000 from the credit union. This is the type of pain and shame now prevalent in holy Ireland. This country is supposed to ensure equality across the board, but that is not happening. It is a pretence to say the health system can gain. Hypocrisy is abroad. What good is it to give tax cuts to the well-off? Why not give money to the health service, where it is needed, and bring expenditure on health up to 8% of GDP? Those who can afford to pay 42% of their income in tax should be made to do so. I am prepared to pay that level of tax in order to provide equal access to orthodontic treatment for all children and orthopaedic treatment for my grandparents and ensure a decent health care system for all. The Government should tax the well-off, if necessary, and not give in to greed.</P>

      <P>They had plenty of funding from the State kitty and the power to bring about change. Here was its chance to cut waiting lists, increase the number of nurse training places, establish a capital modernisation programme and match rhetoric with policy. Why did none of these things happen? Fine Gael Deputies owe it to us to tell us the reason. If they want their promises to improve the health care system to have any credibility, it is incumbent on them to tell the people the reason they failed so abysmally when they had the opportunity.</P>
      <P>Why, for example, did Deputy Noonan, as Minister for Health and Children, manage to increase the health spend by a meagre £400 million in the lifetime of that Government? After seven decades of underfunding here was a chance to turn the tide. Why did he fail?</P>
      <P>Why did Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Finance, not hand over the necessary money for health reform, if that was the problem? I recall being involved in a radio discussion on this topic recently when I asked the spokesman for the Labour Party that question. He muttered something about a deficit. Surely a small deficit would not be a barrier to Mr. Angry from Sandymount whose avowed economic policy is to tax and spend the country into another recession or die in the attempt? Deputy Quinn has no problem with the theory of spending. His problem is with the practice of spending. He has questions to answer as to the reason he did not provide the necessary money for Deputy Noonan. Why was it left to Fianna Fáil in Government to make the necessary changes? It was not until June 1997, when Fine Gael and the Labour Party were ejected from office, that reform at last began.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since that time the health spend has doubled from £2.5 billion to £5 billion. Waiting lists have been cut by 4,100 since June 1997. The number <Col N="507" /> of nurse training places has been increased by one third since 1997. The number of procedures carried out in hospitals has been increased since 1997 by 90,000 per annum. These are facts. Why was none of this done when the Fine Gael Party was in government?</P>
    <P>I am not insulated from the concerns which Deputies on all sides of the House encounter every day. I have constituents in desperate need of medical treatment and who have been failed disgracefully by the health care system but, at least, I can say I am part of a Government which is making a change and that has begun to turn the tide.</P>

They had the money but did not spend it.</P>

As the Minister for Health and Children said last night, the Opposition is playing fantasy health care with the worries of the electorate.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party's version of the quick fix solution is, at least, consistent. That party proposes a universal insurance system. The difficulty with that policy is that every major study of the subject has shown universal insurance systems to be inefficient and to direct more funding at health administration and less at the patient. It is a policy which would certainly shut local hospitals and place insurance policies between the patient and the bed. It is foolish and daft and would not work, but at least it has the merit of consistency.</P>

This is a textbook example of trying to take the low road to high office.</P>
      <P>The health section of the Fine Gael manifesto is worthy of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. Lewis Carroll will never be dead while Deputy Gay Mitchell lives. However, one sentence in the manifesto is a stark statement of truth which sits very uncomfortably with the rest of the fantasy. It reads, &ldquo;Hospital waiting lists are a politically created phenomenon.&rdquo;  That is part of the salesmanship from a party which cut funding allocated to reduce waiting lists in the face of a 26% rise in waiting lists. This is probably an unintended but nevertheless astonishing blunt, brutal, belated and all too rare admission of guilt on the part of those on the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Mitchell and his Fine Gael colleagues for affording me this opportunity to speak on the issue of health. Anyone who examined that party's governmental record on health will have discovered a pattern which was certainly repeated in my Department, and I suspect, across all areas of government. It is an empirical, incontestable pattern of underfunding, neglect, failure to reform and modernise.</P>
      <P>Failure to modernise is the key to what is wrong with health services. This is the era of Star Wars technology, of information technology. Today, I can travel to Tory Island off the Donegal coast and book a flight to London, Paris or Rome, on the internet. I will know the departure time, my seat number and whether I have an aisle or a window seat. This is not happening in medicine or, at least, not enough is being put into technology or the proper area of medicine, primary care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> The future of medicine lies in technological development, DNA in the longer term and MRI-MRI angiogram in the shorter term. I qualified over 25 years ago but what I am about to say now was as true then as it is today. When a person as a patient comes to me as a general practitioner the one thing they want to know is whether there is something wrong with them. Unfortunately, because of the litigious era in which we live, the GP will refer a person to a consultant involving a period of waiting where one basically tells the same story. The GP area of medicine does not have waiting lists but has become a signpost to other areas such as ENT, nephrology, cardiology or respiratory medicine. The consultant then sends a person for tests. They then come back at a later date when he eventually gets a diagnosis and tells them either that they need hospital treatment or surgery or they can go home. If it is the former, they end up on the dreaded waiting list.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the medical service in terms of supply and demand. I accept that in order to overcome the demand side we need more beds, more consultants and more nurses but tonight let me just concentrate minds on the supply side, that is, the number of patients waiting to see consultants. How do we reduce this number? Let me suggest that improving technology at the primary care level is one way. I suggest establishing strategically placed MRI-MRI angiogram centres on greenfield sites, a technology which will give one an almost on-the-spot diagnosis. This could also involve investment from the private sector which is anxious to get involved. With the help of this technology the GP has the diagnosis and then refers a person to the consultant who by this time would not have to spend so much time in consulting rooms but would have more time to spend with his truly sick patients in hospital or the theatre. By using this method we would not have patients taking up unnecessary bed spaces. For example, if someone comes to a GP with a severe headache, they are sent to hospital where they are sometimes kept for four to five days under observation, quite correctly so. With the benefit of MRI-MRI angiogram, they could be sent immediately for treatment or home to take an aspirin. The MRI centres should be on greenfield sites and at the disposal of GPs in specific catchment areas. At a rough estimate, each centre could serve 5,000 patients a year. The cost of this technology would drop with increased usage. Currently they cost £800 to £1,100, but this could be reduced to £200 or £300. It should also be available to all. These are examples of some of the practical ideas on the future of medicine which I and my colleagues in government have been discussing and examining as part of our health strategy.</P>
    <P>On the core issue of spending, the Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government managed to increase health spending by just £400 million. The Government of which I am a member has spent £2.5 billion, a necessary and long overdue <Col N="511" /> increase. Of course, there is more money available today. Our economic policies are successful. However, in the mid-1990s, we were a relatively wealthy state. The money was available but the commitment was lacking. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, pointed out that in January 1997, in a decision which will haunt its protagonists &ndash; Deputy Noonan, now leader of the Fine Gael Party, then Minister for Health and Children, and Deputy Quinn, the present leader of the Labour Party, then Minister for Finance &ndash; they both decided to cut the funding allocated to the reduction of waiting lists by 20%, at a time when they had risen by 27%. That is a fact. Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies now claim that the Government alone is somehow responsible for waiting lists but logic eludes them. Let us look behind the Fine Gael rhetoric on waiting lists and look at the facts. During the lifetime of the rainbow coalition waiting lists rose by 6,600. During the lifetime of the Government we have cut them by 4,101. That is a stark and incontestable fact.</P>
    <P>When 6,600 patients, men, women and children, found themselves waiting for treatments as a direct result of that Government's neglect, why was the funding allocated to alleviating their wait cut by 20%? Whenever a Fine Gael or Labour Party Deputy addresses his constituents, the media or this House, this question should be put to them. Based on this record why should the electorate trust them to effect the reforms so necessary in our health services?</P>
    <P>Having set themselves against an agenda of reform, the Opposition parties advance a series of quick fix health policies. The forced implementation of these policies would ignore the research, the public consultation and the input of our health professionals which have gone into our new health strategy. They would spell disaster for our health services. The Labour Party health policy document states on page 22 at public and voluntary hospitals would be required to cover their operating costs through income from health insurers and patient co-payments, where applicable. This would mean that where smaller local hospitals could not win service contracts from insurance companies, they would not be able to compete with the larger urban hospitals and be forced to close or cut services. Under those Labour Party proposals, the extent of health provision would hinge on the ability of hospitals to negotiate contracts with insurers. This is a right wing, uncaring health policy. All major studies of this model indicate that it leads to an increased percentage of funds being allocated to administration, the sort of policy from which we are trying to move away today.</P>
    <P>I wonder if Fine Gael has a health policy.</P>

Realising how unworkable Labour policy is the Leader of Fine Gael stated in the <i>Irish Independent </i>on 28 May that it now wants to use the existing health system to improve the situation and then opt for the Labour policy &ndash; administration, cutbacks, closures. For all its pontificating on the matter it does not apparently have a health policy.</P>

      <P>Nurses are highly trained health professionals. It takes years of training to develop the skills required to nurse in our hospitals. Fine Gael and Labour in Government four years ago failed to provide the necessary expansion of the nurse training places that were so utterly necessary at that time. That is a legacy we have to overcome. Deputy Quinn stated here on 21 March that six years ago, as Minister for Finance, he was warned about the state of the nursing profession. He failed to act. Had the increases in the nurse training places been put into effect then there would be more nurses now. That is another inescapable fact. It was left to this Government to begin that agenda of reform. As of December 2000 there were 1,774 more nurses working in the health services than in 1997. We have increased the number of training places to 1,500. Already these new places are attracting trainee nurses. The number of applicants for nursing registration diploma courses is up 21% on last year. This action is delivering results.</P>
      <P>We have to look behind the rhetoric to examine the work of the Government on the health services. We have doubled the expenditure. There was a £2 billion capital modernisation programme under the national development plan. There were 90,000 more treatments carried out than in 1997. There were 625 more doctors in the health service and 1,500 more training places. I believe our policies are delivering results. However, the effect of a decade of under-funding cannot be rectified overnight. It will take some years. Lengthy run-in times are a frustrating reality in the health area but I hope the tide is turning.</P>
      <P>For the long-term, for the sustained reform so necessary to the health services, we have been developing our new health strategy. The development of such a strategy has entailed a lengthy process of research, negotiation and consultation with our health professionals and the general public. This strategy will shape the health services for years to come. A rushed job would simply not suffice for such a project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In-depth reports such as value for money audit, the report on the medical manpower and the report of the Commission on Nursing together with the input of our health professionals, whose excellence maintained our health system through <Col N="513" /> the decades of under-funding, have gone into creating this strategy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>On this side of the House, Fianna Fáil in particular is justifiably proud of the fact that in four years it has doubled investment in the health service. The neglect caused in the first instance by the lack of State finances and laterally by the lack of political will on the part of the Rainbow Government had to be stopped once and for all. It is not enough to have turned the tide. We have to reform the system root and branch. Nobody on this side denies there is much still to be done. In four years we have doubled spending, we have introduced significant improvements to our health services and we are in the final stages of developing a new health strategy, the architecture of future reform.</P>
      <P>Some 30,000 nurses form the backbone of our health service. They are highly trained and skilled professionals and need to be treated as such and must remain central to our health policy. All over Europe there are shortages of nurses and Ireland is no different. Many of the problems we face relative to the shortage of nurses stem from the abject failure of those in the Opposition benches who reduced training places in the mid-1990s. Since 1997 we have increased nurse training places by 500. Today the number of nurse training places stands at 1,540. We are heavily engaged in promotional campaigns to encourage school leavers and mature persons to enter the nursing profession. The success of these campaigns is reflected in the fact that applications for nursing registration diploma courses is up 21% on last year.</P>
      <P>We have improved support for nursing students. Since 1998 maintenance grants for nursing students is up 43%. During the period of the Rainbow Coalition the grant remained static. We are recruiting nurses from abroad. A new visa work authorisation system came into operation in June 2000. Up to the end of April 2001, a total of 1,224 visa authorisations had been issued to nurses from non-EU countries. As of last December there were 1,774 more nurses working in our health services than in 1997. It is not just about attracting new nurses; it is about maintaining nurses in good conditions of employment and treating them like the highly trained professionals they are. We have introduced new flexible working arrangements, payment of fees to nurses undertaking part-time nursing and certain other degree courses, payment of fees and full salary to nurses undertaking courses in all specialised areas of clinical practice. We are also committed to implementing the report on the Commission of Nursing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The men who say this is the number one issue taking priority over everything else put it at the bottom of the pile when they had the opportunity to do something. When in Government they discussed what they wanted to do with the health system and made decisions. The key decision was to cut by 20% the funding dedicated to reducing <Col N="514" /> public waiting lists. Why should the people believe they can be trusted to cut waiting lists when the record shows them cutting waiting list funding? Was it better than 90,000 fewer treatments were carried out when they were in power by comparison with last year? Was it better that there were 3,500 fewer residential day and respite care places for people with disabilities? Was it better that there were 400 fewer community nursing unit places for older people? Was it better that there was no capital modernisation programme under way? Was it better that there were fewer doctors and nurses in our hospitals? The public does not believe the Opposition's claim that it has all the answers. When it had the opportunity to do something it failed miserably.</P>

      <P>Obviously they were aided and abetted by their friends in RTE who like this vision of trolleys on corridors and like to dramatise such issues with the onset of a general election. As my colleague Deputy McGennis said, Fine Gael and Labour and, indeed, Democratic Left, had their golden opportunity to advance the health agenda when in Government but did little or nothing. This Government doubled investment in the health services. We know only too well, as pointed out daily, that spend on our health care system is less per head as a percentage of GNP than a great many other European countries. We are in the process of changing that position to enable us to spend more per head as a percentage of GNP on our hospitals and health services. However, it must be done in an orderly way, not the knee-jerk crisis response technique most often used by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, but particularly by the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to speak about that party given that none of its Members is present. I guess from its various press releases and PR announcements that it has an obsession of worry and concern for the patient. Yet when the matter is debated here it is absent. That is a sign of its commitment to the health agenda. I think it was my colleague, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who wrote about Labour's attitude to health &ndash; put publicity before policy and public relations before the patient. That seems to be the Labour Party approach. I hope Fine Gael will not fall into the same trap. If they are in Government after the next election &ndash;  and perhaps South Tipperary is a pointer in that direction &ndash; they will not be in a three party <Col N="515" /> Government. They will be in with three other parties in a four-party coalition backed up by Independents. Having run up the white flag on their own policies in a three party coalition, what will they do in a four party coalition? </P>

      <P>I am sharing time with Deputies Neville, Fitzgerald, Boylan, Connaughton and Ó Caoláin. I listened to Deputy Conor Lenihan with amazement. He does not approve of RTE programmes showing sick women having to go to the courts and sick children waiting for operations. In typical Fianna Fáil fashion, he would push it all under the carpet, let nobody know about it and wait for it to show up in another forum 20 years later. I listened to speakers from the Government side over the last 24 hours. There was one common thread in all their contributions. With the exception of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, who spoke with a little compassion, the others were dreary, tired and worn out. Fresh faces are needed in the Department of Health and Children. Every day, on RTE's &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme and on local radio, one disaster after another emerges from the Department of Health and Children and one disastrous Minister after another comes on the airwaves. They are rather like footballers who have taken so much punishment that they become weary and dreary. That was demonstrated last Sunday in the by-election result. Those Ministers are tired and we must get rid of them.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> Deputies may be aware of a Saturday night TV programme with Marty Whelan. I think it is called &ldquo;Let's go fly with Marty to America&rdquo;. I wish to put a serious proposal to the Government for implementation during their remaining six or 12 months in office and I am also asking my own party to consider it. To deal with our major problem of hospital waiting lists, lotto funding should be used to bring people for treatment to America, Northern Ireland, Britain and elsewhere in Europe until we clear those waiting lists. Every weekend, people come to my clinics in distress, seeking help to get hospital beds and treatment for their loved ones. I am sick and tired of the lack of response to those problems. Instead of being squandered in other directions, lotto funding should be used to deal with the crisis in the health services.</P>

      <P>Last Saturday, one of my constituents, a person of a simple nature, fell in his home. He had to wait until a family member could bring him to Castlebar Hospital. He could not understand the doctor on call, nor could the doctor understand him. He was given pain killers and sent home because he could not be transferred to Galway Regional Hospital for attention to a bone injury until the following Monday morning. His GP had to give him further pain killing injections on Sunday. When he went to Galway on Monday, he was sent home at first as there was no hospital bed available. He was subsequently admitted to the casualty department and a bed was eventually found for him in a nursing home. For Deputy Lenihan's information, that is the kind of health service we now have.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>A Government can be judged on how it treats its young and its elderly. This Government has a disgraceful record in that regard, as I will illustrate. In February of this year, I raised the issue of incontinence pads for elderly people with medical cards in nursing homes. These are surely one of the most vulnerable groups in society. I was eventually informed by the public health nursing section of the Mid-Western Health Board that medical card holders who are not in receipt of nursing home subven<Col N="517" /> tion are entitled to a maximum of 120 pads per month, depending on their need and assessment. Those who have medical cards and are in receipt of subvention from a health board do not qualify for an allowance for incontinence wear. That is the lowest form of discrimination that one could experience. How could one justify withdrawing a medical service because a person had a medical card? </P>
      <P>I raised the issue in this House during the debate on the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. The Minister subsequently informed me that the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, provide that individual residents in private nursing homes, who are in receipt of subvention from a health board, may not be charged extra for any service which is considered to be essential to their maintenance in the home and which is common practice in most nursing homes. Such services included bed and board, nursing care appropriate to the level of dependency of the person and incontinence wear. He further informed me that, on 26 February, at his instructions, a letter was issued to the health boards requesting them to ensure that medical card holders who have entered or will enter private nursing homes retain their eligibility for incontinence wear under the GMS scheme and that all medical card holders in receipt of subvention be supplied with incontinence wear on the same basis as if they were residing in the community. It is an absolute disgrace that, in some health boards, including the Mid-Western Health Board, this directive has not yet been introduced and that people in nursing homes who require incontinence wear are being charged.</P>
      <P>I would like to further point out to the Minister that he quotes nursing home regulations of 1993 which have been breached by the health boards in this instance. That is a disgrace and I ask if he will immediately direct the health boards to refund any moneys which were charged for incontinence wear to patients since 1993. To do anything other than this is to take money from the most vulnerable people, the elderly who are incontinent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 21 June this year Kevin Murphy, the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, was emphatic that people with medical cards are entitled to provision of free long stay care. At present they receive nursing home subvention depending on their level of dependency. The strict interpretation and clear view of the Ombudsman on this issue is that everybody in need of long stay care with a medical card should have it free. I put it to the Minister that the legal position on hospital in-patient services is relatively straightforward. Everybody resident in the State is entitled to be provided with in-patient service, where necessary, by the relevant health board. The services may be provided directly by the health board in one of its own hospitals, or in another publicly funded hospital, for example the so-called voluntary hospitals, or by way of a contracting out arrangement between the health <Col N="518" /> board and a private institution. Such latter arrangements are provided for in section 26 of the Health Act, 1970 and are required to be in accordance with such conditions as the Minister for Health and Children may specify. Where the patient is covered by a medical card this service is free of charge.</P>
    <P>The definition of in-patient services provided for in section 51 of the Health Act, 1970 means institutional services provided for people while maintained in a hospital, convalescent home or home for a person suffering from mental or physical disability or accommodation ancillary thereto. As well as covering acute hospital stays the term self evidently includes wider categories of service such as the long stay care of elderly or disabled people. I consider that an elderly person who needs long stay nursing home type care which typically includes nursing care, and who has a medical card, should receive that care entirely free in nursing homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important and timely motion. It calls on the Minister to ensure that the rights of patients to due, adequate and timely health services are vindicated and upheld. It is very disappointing that the Minister has sought to amend the motion to congratulate himself on having spent more money and on his long overdue planning of a new health strategy.</P>
      <P>A very striking feature of the contributions on the Government side tonight has been the lack of acknowledgement of the serious issues facing the health service and of the suffering facing individual patients. No Government speaker said he or she was sorry that in the past fortnight a woman had to go to the High Court to get her basic right to chemotherapy. The tone of the Government contributions speaks volumes. They simply attacked the Opposition and went back over records from a time when the economy was in a totally different position.</P>
      <P>The almost hysterical speeches tonight by a number of people show the Government is in denial of the crisis facing the health service, or certainly that it is not willing to acknowledge the scale of the problem. Until a problem is acknowledged nothing effective can be done about it. I would have been far more impressed if speakers had taken on board some of the recommendations made by Deputy Gay Mitchell in his very comprehensive address last night and during previous debates on health motions. He put forward a range of initiatives which, if taken on board, would make a difference. I hope the Ministers who will speak tonight will address some of the suggestions and respond to them, saying whether they will take them on board. If they are not to take them on board they should say why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People living in Dublin might suffer more, though people are suffering throughout the country. The waiting lists for Dublin hospitals have risen by an average of 43% since the Government took office. The lists at Blanchardstown hospital <Col N="519" /> and at St. Vincent's in Elm Park show the highest increase at 202% and 102% respectively. The waiting lists for Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, rose by 27% in the past three months alone. There are 15,603 people waiting for a bed in a Dublin hospital, that is 59% of the people on waiting lists nationally. The recommendations made by Deputy Mitchell for dealing with the shortage of nurses in Dublin should be taken on board by the Minister. Can the Government justify its failure to the 83% of children who have been waiting for more than one year for cardiac surgery at Dublin's children's hospitals?</P>
    <P>I am very happy to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope, if this motion sponsored by Fine Gael can get one clear message to the Minister for Health and Children and his advisers, it is that the health services are in a shambles. Will the Minister take that on board and make a start and do something constructive about putting in place a proper health care service? It gives me no joy to say this. The Minister must be aware of the problem through dealing with constituents in his clinic. Surely they are coming to the Minister and backbench Deputies with complaints similar to those being raised with me. Are we unique on this side of the House in that people are only coming to us as they have lost all faith in Ministers and Government backbenchers? I do not think this is so, but people feel the Government is not listening.</P>
      <P>It gives me no joy to point out to the Minister that there are 26,000 people on a waiting list. These people are in pain and are suffering. Will the Minister take this on board? There are 150,000 waiting for appointments, and they do not know how serious their situation is, or if it is very serious. People are dying as a result of the mismanaged health care service &ndash; I say that clearly and distinctly in the hope it will sink in. The Minister must address the management crisis in the health care service. The issue is the breakdown in management, and we need a strong Minister and one who is prepared to tackle this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throwing money at it will not solve the problem. Some £30 million has been allocated to various health boards for projects within their areas which have not been embarked upon because they cannot make a decision as to where services should be located. Ministerial intervention is called for: the Minister should say enough is enough and that he will no longer stand for it. He took the responsibility from the Taoiseach to act as Minister, and people expect him to act. An example of what I am talking about is the non-existent cancer care services in the North-Eastern Health Board area. Poor female neighbours of mine who have breast cancer problems have to travel to Dublin by public transport to have their operations and follow-on procedures. The Minister is aware of the trauma and pain regular trips to Dublin hospitals causes patients and their fam<Col N="520" /> ilies. At the same time we have had in place for four years a mammography machine which is not operational, but which was recommended for the Cavan general hospital by the Cancer Support Group. Need I say more? It is not good enough and not acceptable. If the Minister is not prepared to deal with this important issue he should do the decent thing and step aside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity to raise two specific health matters in the very limited time allocated. I put the Minister for Health and Children on notice that discussions on the initial contract between the owners of the Bon Secours hospital in Tuam and the Western Health Board concerning the value of the property appear to have broken down this week. I want the Minister to understand that the people of Tuam and its hinterland will not accept anything less than a community type hospital as outlined by the Western Health Board and agreed by him. Further, the people of Tuam will not stand for a summer of wrangling between two bodies which should have the same ideological mind set in so far as the provision a good hospital service is concerned. I accept the Western Health Board should only pay the going rate for the property, no more and no less and the Bon Secours Order should be comfortable with a fair price. I do not want the rest of the year taken up with squabbling over the valuation of a building, now vacant, and a piece of land. There is no reason an independent group of valuers, expert at their job and acknowledged in the industry as being professional, should not be employed to arrive at a reasonable valuation for the sale.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware the hospital was closed nearly three months ago. Tuam cannot afford to be without the services of a hospital and any unwarranted delay such as the present impasse on price will not be tolerated. We know the Minister has the money and it is time we got our share of it.</P>
      <P>The waiting list for orthodontic services has stretched to between four and five years. If ever there was a two-tier health service &ndash; and we have said it time and again here tonight and last night &ndash; it is to be found particularly in the dental area. If a family has money their children will get orthodontic treatment almost on the strength of a phone call but if they have a medical card they wait for four or five years. I find it extraordinarily difficult to understand how our health board in the west could manage to clear the waiting lists five or six years ago and in the last few years they are back to where they started. It takes up to £4,000 in some cases for families to pay private orthodontists for what the health board should be doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 12 year old child of a neighbour of mine was told by the school orthodontist that he was not entitled to treatment and this decision was appealed to no avail. A private orthodontist identified a difficult dental problem that would take £2,000 to solve. If that is the way patients are <Col N="521" /> treated in the Western Health Board, then God help anybody who has to wait on their scheme for orthodontic treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. As all of my colleagues have said, the health service is the most serious issue affecting the Government and the people of this country. We all find a large number of requests at our clinics from people on waiting lists for hip replacements, coronary care and orthodontic treatment. This is affecting all strata of society. During this Government's time in office a two-tier health service has developed &ndash; people who are in the public health service on medical cards cannot get a service and people who have private health care are availing of the service.</P>
      <P>Throwing money at the situation is not necessarily going to resolve the matter. More money is needed but we also have to look at where the money is being spent. A recent report revealed that 47% of jobs created in the health service over the last three years was in administration and only 7% was in medical care. One does not have to be a genius to work that one out &ndash; we have a bureaucratic health service. I am not blaming the people in the administration end of the health service, but do we need 47% extra administrators and only 7% extra people working at the coal face ? We need more doctors, nurses, orderlies and those who are at the forefront providing the service &ndash; we certainly do not need more administrators. Whatever has gone wrong has been due to mismanagement and the Government has to make some tough decisions which it has not done up to now. The Minister is waiting for a report on how the health service will proceed for the next seven years, and if he continues the way he has been doing, the difficulties will be multiplied rather than reduced.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael's call for the establishment of an ombudsman for the health service is an excellent idea. This would provide somebody to look at the difficulties in the health service. We have to look at the way we run it &ndash; is there a need for six health boards in a small country? In 1979 there were 95 people working in administration in all of the Dublin hospitals while today there are over 11,000 administrators throughout the health service. The amount of money that is put in health service administration is unjust &ndash; the money should be spent where it is needed so that people who are on public service waiting lists can be called for their operations when they need them. As my colleague, Deputy Boylan, said, people have died because they could not get a bed or the service they required and that is not good enough. I hope that the Government and the Minister for Health and Children will take their responsibilities seriously and initiate the change necessary to have a proper health service.</P>

      <P>I support the Fine Gael motion before the House this evening. In <Col N="522" /> the Environment and Local Government Committee over the past number of days the defence of local democracy was one of the central issues which we were seeking to address. I refer to this specifically because there was an example recently in my own county of Monaghan where the real potential of local democracy in giving the lead to communities was demonstrated when all parties and views moulded together in common cause in support of the community we represent. On 21 June we organised &ndash; what I believe is a prime example of positive leadership &ndash; a maternity services forum for the Border counties which sought to address the critical issue of the closure of maternity services at the local hospital. Under the auspices of the county council and as part of a cross-party team of Monaghan members of the North-Eastern Health Board, I and others helped to organise what was a very successful event. We secured a list of eminent speakers who addressed the forum on all aspects of maternity care.</P>
      <P>What emerged most clearly from the contributions was the grave danger posed to all services at Monaghan General Hospital as a result of the withdrawal of its maternity unit by the executive of the health board. Professional opinion agreed that with the maternity unit gone there would be a domino effect which could see the closure of key services, one after the other, until we would be left with what one speaker described as a glorified health centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister that the two key resolutions adopted by the forum be taken on board. The forum unanimously endorsed the call for the appointment of a second obstetrician, an in-hospital paediatrician and the provision of an epidural service on request for all mothers-to-be at Monaghan General Hospital. The forum called unanimously on the Minister for Health and Children to make a positive and public intervention that will clearly show the Minister and his Government's support for the retention and development of maternity services at Monaghan General Hospital. Those motions were passed with vocal enthusiasm at the forum and by all opinion, including the representatives of the Minister's own party. We are not being listened to, and this is the real issue. What we demonstrated at local level in working together in common cause should in fact be the template that would apply at this level also &ndash; but that is not the case. The real losers are the women of County Monaghan, their unborn children and the lives of generations to come who are being put in jeopardy. We have demonstrated time and again, and 35,000 people, in our low population base, signed a petition supporting the retention and development of the maternity unit at Monaghan General Hospital. These people must be listened to and I appeal on behalf of all the political representation in County Monaghan. I hope that the real needs of real people will be addressed at local and national levels and that we will see the provision for all our people of a level of care and intent on <Col N="523" /> the part of Government that will see a levelling out of the health services regardless of ability to pay.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil sé ceart agus cóir go bhfuilimid tar éis an díospóireacht seo a bheith againn le dhá oíche anuas. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the health service. There is no more important issue for the people or the Government, or indeed any of us as individuals. Each of us wants to see a health service that is able to respond quickly to the needs of people, be they young or old, a health service that would be reformed and well funded, inclusive and able to allay their fears and give them the care and help they require. While I recognise that much has to be done in the health service it is important both sides of the House recognise what has been done as well and that real progress has been made in the last number of years.</P>
      <P>It is important both sides of the House recognise what has been done as well and that real progress has been made in recent years. That progress has come about as a result of the increases in health funding and the substantial investment in the health services. That has been discussed by Deputies on this side of the House in recent nights. Both sides have recognised that investment alone is not enough. We can talk about figures but unless that is put in the context of an overall health strategy, we will be working in isolation. That is why the new health strategy is in the final stages of its preparation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a health strategy which has involved detailed consultation and discussion with everybody involved in the health service, particularly the users and the patients. Thousands of submissions have been received. It is based not only on the views of people, but on factual reports. It is based on a value for money audit, the manpower report and the Commission on Nursing to ensure that this strategy is one which can set out over the next few years how the increased investment, and the commitment to investment, can be used to benefit people. It is important we recognise what has been and continues to be done during the course of this Government. The investment is bringing down waiting lists. In the four year term of this Government, those figures are now 4,101 fewer than they were. I acknowledge there are still many people waiting, but at least there are fewer people on the waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a specific reference to children waiting for surgery, something our funding is targeting. It is aiming to ensure that no child will have to wait longer than six months. It is important to say the lists and the waiting times have reduced substantially. The decreases are evi<Col N="524" /> dent. In regard to children waiting longer than six months for cardiac surgery, there has been a decrease of 78%, a very welcome decrease. For children waiting for general surgery, there has been a decrease of 16% and for children waiting for ophthalmology, there has been a decrease of 50%. These are all real indicators of how the money is being spent to benefit children and to make sure they are getting the health treatment and care they deserve. That applies not only to children but to everybody.</P>
    <P>Some 90,000 more people got treatment last year than, for example, in 1997 when this Government took office. There are more doctors, nurses and paramedics. There is more capital investment in hospitals. Deputy Fitzgerald referred to St. Vincent's Hospital. The £160 million which has been promised and is being spent in investment in that hospital will not only benefit her constituents and mine but people from all over the country who use that hospital.</P>
    <P>I refer to the extra 4,000 people we see by way of doctors, dentists, nurses and paramedics. There was a reference to administrators but let us focus on the people who are carrying out the practice on the ground. Let us focus on the medical cards for the over 70s which will make a real difference to their lives. Let us focus on the extra nurses who are making a real difference in our hospitals.</P>
    <P>I refer to the implementation of the cancer strategy. Some £60 million has been spent over the past four years. It is a cancer strategy which aims to provide breast checks to ensure breast cancer problems in women can be detected early and be treated. There is increased North-South co-operation in a number of areas which we can see in relation to cancer and joint research and action. It is the way forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Allen and Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
      <P>It is entirely appropriate that my maiden speech, as a Member of Dáil Éireann representing the people of South Tipperary, should be on the lack of equity and accessibility in the health services. The crisis which is besetting what should be a showcase health service was the main focus of the by-election campaign we fought in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>The main emotions experienced by those who have access to the health services and those medical, nursing and paramedical staff who work in the health services are fear and anger. For patients, it is fear of being left on a trolley for days in the overcrowded casualty department, fear of being on a hospital waiting list for years on end or of having to travel to Dublin for oncology services or fear that because one is denied a medical card, one's modest income will not stretch to pay for the essential medication for one's sick child.</P>
      <P>Medical and nursing staff are fearful too. They are stressed by the overcrowded conditions, by long working hours and by inadequate equipment. They are angry about the lack of policy direction, about staff shortages, about the pressure on beds and about having to think of discharging a patient early to make way for someone who is even in more need. General practitioners are angry about seeing their patients' conditions worsen while they wait for an appointment or test and about having to telephone a consultant to plead for a special appointment or to get a very sick patient higher in the queue. Anger and fear are the emotions engendered by a health service which the Government has described as excellent.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister accused the Fine Gael party of playing politics with the health service. It is the politics of this Government which is crippling the health services. It is the politics of spin, hype and photo calls. It is the politics of leaving everything to the last minute and having the promises made just in time for the election manifesto, but too late for many patients.</P>
      <P>In constituency, health board area and in the rest of the country, the lack of a national health strategy is painfully obvious. It is obvious in the fact that the chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board has described his main anxiety as the lack of hospital beds in this area. It is painfully obvious to the 1,623 men, women and children on the South-Eastern Health Board waiting list whose chance of and right to a speedy admission is now further away than ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the facts of this excellent health service. The nurses at St. Joseph's Hospital in Clonmel have had to take radical action to ensure proper patient care in dreadful conditions. Thousands of people are in the queue to join the queue <Col N="526" /> to see a consultant, including a young man from Carrick-on-Suir who has already been waiting five years for such an appointment and who, like others, has not even got on a hospital waiting list. Some 7,000 people in South Tipperary could have a medical card tomorrow if the Government would revise the miserly income limits. Some 10,500 people nationally have been waiting well over a year for hip replacements or for cardiac operations. Almost 11,000 will be marking their first year on the hospital waiting list any day now. The South-Eastern Health Board is already under funded by £1.3 million in the first four months of this year due to the additional overtime payments because of staff shortages. This is the reality of the excellent health service about which we talk.</P>
    <P>The Government is failing all the people on the hospital waiting list. It is failing all the people it unjustly deprives of a medical card. It is failing our nurses and doctors who have to work in stressful conditions. It is also failing the elderly. Most people hope to have an active old age but a sizeable minority of older people are likely to need special care. In light of a rapidly increasing older population, the challenge to provide adequate support both at home and in the community is significant. For many, the prospect of paying for essential nursing home care is a nightmare. At present, the average subvention is £116 per week. Families require an additional £10,000 to £15,000 per annum to meet the remaining costs. This is not realistic for the majority of families. Increased nursing home subventions would alleviate hardship and anxiety for many elderly people and their families. Fine Gael believes that elderly people and people with disabilities should be given every support necessary to allow them to live independently in their own homes and communities. The reality is that such supports are not provided for many people. It is essential that affordable, accessible and high quality nursing home facilities are provided to ensure people can avail of short-term, long-term and respite care where it is needed.</P>
    <P>Many facilities for the elderly are under-funded. St. Patrick's Hospital in Cashel requires an urgent injection of more than £1 million to enable it to continue to provide high quality care in high quality surroundings. Many older people can manage at home with the assistance of minor aids such as stair rail fittings, walk-in showers, wheelchairs or ramps. Thousands of elderly people are awaiting assessment for such assistance, some up to two years. Even when they are assessed, they must wait years before the work is carried out. For older people who experience difficulty climbing stairs, for example, this can prove very distressing.</P>
    <P>The scheme of housing aid for the elderly is in a shambles. In my own health board area &ndash; the same applies in many other health board areas &ndash; the budget for the scheme will be used up by April. This means that only a maximum of 33% of applications can be processed and funded in <Col N="527" /> any one year. This is a outright disgrace. We are supposed to assist elderly people to live independently. We are supposed to keep people out of hospital and help them to live with dignity. However, with a budget which lasts for only four months of the year, how can we fulfil these objectives?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Tom Hayes on his maiden speech. Although my time is limited, I want to address three points. The Minister of State spoke about decisions based on strategy. One cannot make decisions on the future of our health services based on bogus figures such as those outlined by the Minister in regard to waiting lists. The Minister cited figures for in-patient waiting lists. I tabled a number of parliamentary questions to his Department on out-patient waiting lists to ascertain the true extent of the crisis and was informed that it did not compile figures in this area. I became suspicious and carried out my own research. I asked the Southern Health Board to provide me with the number of out-patients on the waiting lists and the information makes for very interesting reading.</P>
      <P>The Minister informed the House that 535 people are awaiting in-patient appointments at Cork University Hospital. He neglected to inform us that 5,266 people are awaiting out-patient appointments. The Minister stated that 512 people are awaiting orthopaedic surgery in the Cork area but this hides the reality that 1,240 GP-referred patients are awaiting out-patient appointments. He stated that some 600 people are awaiting in-patient appointments in Tralee but omitted the fact that 2,000 people are awaiting out-patient appointments. The Minister stated that 5,000 children are on waiting lists for in-patient orthodontic treatment but failed to say that a further 5,000 are awaiting preliminary out-patient appointments to assess their needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is resorting to hype and propaganda and is playing games with a very serious issue. I challenge him to outline the true extent of the problem in our hospitals. If the figures provided by the Southern Health Board are indicative of figures nationwide, we have a huge crisis on our hands.</P>
      <P>The Minister prides himself on being open about the facts. The centralisation of services in the Dublin area has resulted in turmoil and conflict in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service. Some time ago, the Minister announced that Mr. Phil Flynn had been asked to assess the internal workings of the IBTS. Yesterday, in response to a parliamentary question I tabled, the Minister refused to publish the report. He is hiding the facts. I challenge him to produce this report in order that we can see the true extent of the problems in the IBTS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> Due to time constraints, I cannot comprehensively address the third problem I wished to raise. The Minister must immediately provide the funding necessary to prevent elderly people being evicted from nursing homes throughout the country and to alleviate the problems experienced by their families who live in fear of mounting debts. He should note the comments made last Thursday week by the Ombudsman at a meeting of the Committee on Health and Children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those Members who contributed constructively to this debate. One or two of the contributions made were nothing more than vulgar abuse. They did not add to the debate and certainly will not read well on the record. While I will not accuse the Minister for Health and Children of vulgar abuse, his contribution represented political point scoring and did not address the issues. Given the extent of the difficulties in our health service, this does not augur well. I found the opening comments of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, which were similar to those I have advanced, very interesting. Investment in primary care must be considered in the context of reforming the health service.</P>
      <P>On 13 February, the House debated a motion tabled by Fine Gael condemning the prolonged and systematic improper extraction by health boards of money from vulnerable old people in need of nursing home care and from their families with the full knowledge of the Department of Health and Children. I pointed at that time to an extraordinary catalogue of bad practice and financial impropriety in regard to which the Department failed to take appropriate action. The Minister in reply stated:</P>
      <P>My Department has instructed the relevant health boards to take immediate steps to pay all outstanding arrears. I assure the House that my Department is continuing to pursue the matter vigorously with the health boards concerned.</P>
      <P>What price the Minister's assurance and commitment? Six months on, only one-sixth of the repayments have been made. Some £4.5 million extracted by the State from vulnerable old people and their families is still outstanding. So much for urgency and commitment. The Midland, Southern and North-Western Health Boards have not paid any money at all in spite of the Minister's assurances and the remainder have paid a paltry £254,000.</P>

      <P>This is an absolute disgrace but why should we be surprised? What more can we expect from this Government and this Minister? In the new language which has emerged under this Government, &ldquo;urgency&rdquo; means one waits and waits and &ldquo;priority&rdquo; means one forgets about something altogether. The Minister has <Col N="529" /> remained inactive, inert and ineffective. He offers empathy and assurance but when has he actually taken action? This is a further nail in the coffin of the Minister's credibility. He must ensure this money is paid back immediately.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, would realise that we do not think Members on this side of the House have a monopoly of wisdom and understanding of this problem. Members on all sides of the House have a heart. I do not understand the lack of strategy, leadership and competence. That is what the Minister of State is paid for. The Government has been in office for four years and failed dismally. It has failed the poor, in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> If one is wealthy, one can have whatever one wants because one can pay for it. If one is not wealthy, one must go on a waiting list and a waiting list to get on that waiting list. That is how the numbers have been reduced. As the consultant about whom the Minister, Deputy McDaid, spoke cannot be seen for months and years on end, some cannot even get on a waiting list. That is the reality of the health system.</P>

      <P>These amendments deal with Part 3, section 12, which refers to local authority membership, eligibility for local authority membership and disqualification. Amendment No. 25 in my name and those of Deputies Gilmore and Mitchell is the critical one as it seeks the continuation of section 14 as part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, this is one of the critical and core issues at the heart of the Local Government Bill, 2000, as presented to us by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey. That it is being discarded as a result of pressure from a number of quarters is to undermine one of the very few worthwhile changes the Minister had embodied in the original Bill. Members of local authorities are already greatly disappointed that the Bill does not seek to empower the democratically elected and accountable members of the authorities. In the limited range of areas where real reform is intended, we now see that that short list has been shortened even further. This is one of the core issues and is a deciding factor in my approach to this Bill. I wish to put on notice that I will certainly be pressing this.</P>

      <P>I have not spoken on this Bill, in fact I had my say on this issue within the confines of my political party. I am prompted to rise by the astonishing hypocrisy that has been trotted out. I have always taken the view that there is nothing wrong with the dual mandate. I will point to people like Jacques Chaban-Delmas who served the people of his constituency and France for a long and distinguished period. I could not believe my ears when the Deputy who represents Sinn Féin &ndash; a party that might be interested in the not too distant future in having people who would be entitled to sit here and in another Parliament &ndash; rose to talk about dual mandates being a core issue.</P>
      <P>I have not spoken on this issue to date. The most appropriate way to serve one's constituents is in the way in which they honour you when they select you in an election. The Bill is good, it is reforming and from a reforming Minister and the Bill will not suffer because of this change which is in accordance with the views I have long held on the dual mandate. It is extraordinary to hear somebody suggest that there is something fundamentally wrong with being allowed to represent one's constituents on a local authority when one considers what we have been discussing in the not too distant past, and the possibility of people representing constituencies here and having the right to sit in another Parliament.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 27, line 44, to delete &ldquo;section, or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments seek to delete a number of proposed disqualifications that would apply to people who may wish to seek election to local authorities. Paragraphs (f2&gt;j) to (f2&gt;m) on page 28 refer to those undergoing a term of imprisonment for any term exceeding six months imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State. I made the point on Committee Stage and I reaffirm it here today as the first member of my party to stand within the modern Dáil that it is very important not to lose sight of the fact that in the experience of nearly all the political parties represented in this House, people who have undergone terms of imprisonment have been elected to this and comparable bodies. It is very important that we recognise the input and role of people who may for whatever reason find themselves imprisoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of paragraph (f2&gt;j) runs completely contrary to the understanding I believed was common to most opinion reflected here and accepted, that is, that those who found themselves in prison out of the recent conflict on and between these islands were critical influences in the development of the new political dispensation that currently applies. The idea that the predecessor of the office I hold as an elected republican Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan, who was elected 20 years ago last month in 1981 by the people of Cavan-Monaghan, an imprisoned young Belfast Republican, could not have stood because of what paragraph (f2&gt;j) entails is absolutely unacceptable to me and something I find highly objectionable on the 20th anniversary of his death. The inclusion of paragraph (f2&gt;k) which reads, &ldquo;fails to pay any sum or any portion of any sum charged or surcharged, by an auditor of the accounts of any local authority, upon or against that person&rdquo;, or (f2&gt;l) &ldquo;fails to comply with a final judgment, order or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, for payment of money due to any local authority&rdquo; would exclude those who, in <Col N="536" /> principle, would argue against the imposition of certain charges. This was reflected in the not too distant past when a number of Deputies were very much to the fore in the campaign of opposition to the dual taxation in relation to water which saw a mighty campaign organised at grassroots level throughout the country. To exclude someone who has not paid a charge out of a very strongly held view or principle from the opportunity of presenting themselves for election at the appropriate time is absolutely unacceptable. I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendments which seek to delete these debarments.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f2&gt;m) fails to recognise the right of people to change, reform or accept a different view of their role within society. It refers to fraudulent or dishonest dealings affecting a local authority. Why just a local authority and not fraudulent or dishonest dealings, period? The truth is that what must be reflected here is that people have the right to reform. We should not be talking about disbarment or disqualification but about creating an opportunity for people to find their place within the democratic process. That is the critical test of democracy and the provision of local participation and accountability. Therefore, I strongly urge the Minister of State to accept my amendments.</P>

      <P>There was an extensive debate on these issues on Committee Stage. The further point which needs to be made is that the disqualifications referred to in section 13 are based on current law and are fair and balanced. On the one hand, they disqualify people who have deliberately rebutted local authority powers and shown disregard for the system of local government and, on the other, the qualifications are not permanent. Subsection (2) provides they only remain for a period of five years from the date of commencement of judgment and for longer than six months in regard to a prison sentence. This only relates to someone who is undergoing such prison sentence. In these circumstances, if one is a local authority member, one would be depriving the electorate of representation while one was imprisoned. When one is released from prison, one is eligible for membership.</P>

      <P>I already made the point that, by virtue of the provision in the Bill, Deputy Kieran Doherty, who was elected to this House in June 1981, would not have been able to put his case before the electorate. Closing off that opportunity and mechanism is patently wrong. Such interventions have proven to be a positive factor in the development of politics on this island. That is a generational reality and all political parties have a certain experience and knowledge of that fact. The extension of the exclusion beyond the sentencing for a further period of five <Col N="537" /> years is an echo of the earlier point in regard to cathaoirligh and mayors not just for that term but for a subsequent year. Why for a further five years? How is this assessment done? If people have concluded a sentence, they can re-engage in society and further restrictions should not apply. Restrictions should not apply in any instance but to have a further extension of debarment is patently unjust. It is an extension of the sentencing procedures within the court process. I strongly disagree with the Minister of State in this regard and intend to press amendments Nos. 20 and 21.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> In page 32, line 2, after &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, except where <i>paragraph (c)</i> or <i>(d)</i> or<i> (e)</i> of <i>subsection (1)</i> apply,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 30 and 31 to section 19 are consequential on the new section 14 prohibiting multiple membership of certain local authorities. It is also relevant in situations where a person stands in a number of local electoral areas within the same local authority.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister indicated that he would consider an amendment to ensure the provisions of section 19, which introduce a new requirement whereby a casual vacancy must be filled by a person nominated by the relevant political party, would not apply in limited circumstances of potential abuse. This means that a person elected to a number of local authorities must, under existing law, on election opt for one and a casual vacancy occurs in the other. The same arrangements will now also apply where a person is elected to a number of different county or city councils. He or she must choose one and in such cases the resulting casual vacancies are not subject to the party nomination requirement.</P>
    <P>Without this provision, it would be open to a single candidate to stand for election in a multiplicity of local authorities. If he or she was elected, the party concerned would then scoop up all the seats through the artificial co-option situation created. This would amount to an abuse of the system. Amendment No. 31 replicates this situation but in relation to casual vacancies arising from a non-party candidate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In page 35, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) In considering making a request under <i>paragraph (a)</i>, the Minister may have regard to the extent of population changes in local electoral areas within counties and cities as shown in the latest census report of the Central Statistics Office which&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i) sets out the population of the State, classified by area, and</P>
      <P>(ii) is published following a census of population.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues raised in this amendment were discussed in detail on Committee Stage and I have <Col N="539" /> carefully considered the matters raised by the Deputies at that time. The amendment addresses some of the concerns raised by providing that, in considering making a request to the local government commission to review local electoral areas, the Minister may take account of population changes highlighted by the most recent census.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make it mandatory for the Minister to request the commission to carry out a review of the electoral areas after every census. If there are no significant changes in population, a review would waste the commission's time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment arises from concerns expressed on Committee Stage about the significant changes in population taking place, particularly in boundary areas between towns and counties. This tends to lead to under-representation in counties, particularly where there is a spill-over, and demands for increasing the size of the town. We must decide whether we want to opt for bigger or a multiplicity of towns or the county as the main unit. The decision I favour is a move towards regarding the county as the main unit of local government, but also ensuring the numbers are properly represented. This would facilitate the emergence of local area committees.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has gone some way towards recognising this aspect, although the amendment pays little more than lip-service. There is a world of difference between &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. It is not a huge change in the legislation; the Minister was always required to have regard to population changes. It will not make a huge difference, but its inclusion in the legislation makes it more likely that the Minister may have regard to such changes. I will agree to the amendment although it does not go as far as I would wish.</P>

      <P>The number of members of each council is a contentious matter. Wexford County Council has 21 members for a population of 100,000, while our neighbour, Carlow, has 21 members for a population of 60,000. Some counties have 28 members for populations of between 60,000 and 80,000. Successive Governments and Bills have failed to rectify the situation. When a commission is established to examine each county in respect of its population, there should be some relation drawn between the population and the number of councillors in each area. This is not the case at present and the Bill does nothing to ensure it will happen. This has been the subject of arguments for many years but the problem has never been put right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing in the Minister's amendment improves this situation. In County Wexford there are three urban district councils and one corporation. <Col N="540" /> When the last review took place in County Wexford one seat was taken from the north of the county and put into the Wexford area, which already has a corporation as well as representation on the county council. The Wexford area, with a population of 28,000, has seven representatives while the Gorey area, with a population of 17,000 has only four seats.</P>
    <P>The question is a difficult one and it has been very badly handled down the years. It is not equitable. What consideration is given to population when the number of councillors in each county is decided?</P>

      <P>You will know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that our own county of Monaghan is the only county authority with 20 seats, the minimum number. Every other local authority has at least one seat more than the minimum number. Counties with a population less than half that of Monaghan have more seats than ours.</P>
      <P>The issue of equalisation must be addressed. The Minister of State seems to suggest  a comparable population base when he speaks about the rural situation. On Committee Stage he projected the effect of that in terms of the major population areas, and particularly the city situation, as to the numbers you would then find within a city council chamber. It is not a simple issue but there is a need to address like situations in rural areas while looking at the larger urban and city centres independently of that. That formula is not presented in the Minister's amendment. The point with regard to changing &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; may aid &ndash; or shall aid &ndash; if the Minister of State accepts it.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael amendment proposed to section 89 also serves to imply that the commission could, on its own initiative, increase or decrease the total number of members. The commission's function, however, is to allocate the total membership of the local authority among whatever number of local electoral areas may be considered appropriate. It is only a local authority which can itself seek an increase in its total membership. This is provided for in section 22. For that reason, Deputy Mitchell's proposal that the commission take account of the viability of area committees when determining additional representation cannot be accepted.</P>

      <P>Current legislation and this Bill provide for local authorities to be suspended and for the appointment of a Commissioner to replace them. Local authority members must have the right to act in the interest of the electorate. Rather than a commissioner replacing a local authority at the instigation of the Minister, the balance should be struck in the other direction and the ultimate hand in determining whether a local authority has its term of office cut short vested in the electorate.</P>
      <P>We should allow for registered electors to make such a representation to the Minister and the Minister should be obliged to comply with the request.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The thinking behind this amendment is that the scenario provided for in the amendment could come into play if the electorate were dissatisfied with their local authority and they would request <Col N="543" /> the Minister, by petition, to call a new election. No such provisions apply at national level, nor do I think them appropriate at local level. Any electoral system needs a measure of certainty not to be collapsed at the first unpopular decision. As was indicated during the debate on Committee Stage, if there were such high levels of dissatisfaction with the local authority, the Minister would have power under Part 21 to hold a formal inquiry into the matter. This would seem to be a proper and civilised way of dealing with an extreme situation where that was deemed necessary. I notice that the Opposition has tabled later amendments which propose to remove that power from the Minister. There seems to be some contradictory thinking. This could be a recipe for total disaster and could destroy local government as we know it. In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>To destroy local government as we know it, and anarchy, are very distant thought processes from the thinking that crafted this amendment. This is about affirming what democracy is, accountability, and not allowing to go unchecked the delivery of mandates and commitments made at times of elections, where a period of five years must elapse before the electorate can pass judgment. We have had many instances over the recent decades when commitments at local authority level in particular and also in elections to this House, secured and mandates with the election of particular voices and collectives of voices. Much to the dismay of the electorate, the commitments made completely melted away within a matter of weeks and months. The electorate cannot be treated like this, with only one day in every five in which to pass judgment. There must be another mechanism where when their interest is being completely negated, when the commitments made and the undertaking of service has been completely turned on its head, that the electorate can call to check that abuse. This mechanism is open to discussion and debate but the principle is correct and it is far from anarchy and far from the intent of undermining the democratic process. It is about strengthening it and giving people a continual interest and sense of ownership over their governance at local authority level. I wish to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 37, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>v</i>) information in the Irish language.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is an incredible compilation of amendments and it would be difficult to speak to each of them. I will focus on a couple of them. Amendment No. 41 seeks to add paragraph (v to the list of those areas in relation to the conduct of elections where section 27(2) talks about &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (1)</i>, regulations under this section may in particular include provision for all or any of the following matters in relation to local elections:&rdquo;. It proceeds to list them from (<i>a</i>) to (<i>u</i>). I acknowledge that the Minister and his Department colleagues have taken on board a considerable number of the arguments that I and other Members presented on Committee Stage in relation to the importance and the centrality of the promotion of the Irish language in the delivery of local democracy and local administration. Amendment No. 70 in the name of the Minister, addresses this.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of amendment No. 41 is a very reasonable and sensible proposition that is not reflected in amendment No. 70 in any specific way. Amendment No. 70 is aspirational. This is specific where we still have the language of &ldquo;may&rdquo; as against &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and that is the Minister's comfort factor. The inclusion of paragraph &ldquo;(<i>v</i>), information in the Irish language&rdquo; is essential at that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will withdraw a number of my amendments in favour of the Minister's amendment No. 70 On this basis, I ask him to consider the whole area of the use of &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. The Minister's amendment No. 70 goes a long way towards recognising the importance and the centrality of the promotion of the Irish language through our local authorities and in local democracy. It says &ldquo; A local authority may in performing its functions, take such steps as it considers appropriate to encourage the use of the Irish language&rdquo;. With respect to all local authorities, the word used should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. This is not something optional. In Amendment No. 70 at subsection 2(<i>a</i>) &ldquo;The Minister may in accordance with this section, issue or arrange for the issue, to local authorities of guidelines, codes of practice&rdquo; and so on. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be used instead. In paragraph (3) of the amendment the Minister says &ldquo;A local authority shall have regard to such guidance in the performance of its functions&rdquo;, and it lists a number of those and the Minister has incorporated where the Minister may from time to time appoint an advisory group. The Minister should have an advisory group made up of the component parts that have been indicated in his amendment. Not least of those in importance are those in paragraph (iv) where &ldquo;at least 2 persons from <Col N="545" /> organisations concerned with the promotion of the Irish language&rdquo; would be included in that advisory group to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider changing &ldquo;may&rdquo; where I pointed out that it was deficient and urged the inclusion of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. The Minister might even on Report Stage recognise the import of that and the message that it delivers and accede to my request to strengthen amendment No. 70.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House agrees to accept the amendment, I will be happy to accede to the request to amend section 68 in amendment No. 70. It would then read &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo;. I will accept that. In the amendment which I propose and which is in response to the valid points made during the course of Committee Stage, it says that a local authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; have regard to such guidance in the performance of its function. If the Minister did not act in accordance with subsection 2 (<i>a</i>), then the local authority would not be obliged to follow any guidance if it had not been given. On that basis it could be justified that the obligation should be put on the Minister to draw up the guidelines and the other factors provided for in (2) <i>(a), (b)</i> (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v). Paragraph (v) ends with the promotion generally of the Irish language. Má tá an Teach sásta an t-athrú sin a ghlacadh &ndash; an leasú ar an leasú &ndash; tá mé sásta é sin a dhéanamh. If the House accepts that change I will be happy to agree to it.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(10) For a person to be nominated for the position of Mayor he or she must have served at least 5 years as an elected member of a local authority.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I resubmitted this amendment although I am not entirely happy to put preconditions on anybody running for a particular elected office. I remind the Minister of State this was agreed with the various bodies representing elected representatives as a precautionary measure to ensure that those being elected to this significant position for a period of five years have some experience of how local authorities work. I pointed out the pitfalls of this measure on Committee Stage. I am of the view that it would be hugely disruptive to local government and would slow up an already slow decision making process and introduce tension between the council and the elected mayor and between the mayor and the manager. The Minister said he would make available to us the legal advice which suggested this would not be constitutional. That advice has not been made available to me although he said on Committee Stage the legal advice would be made available. Since it was not made available I decided to resubmit the amendment. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this matter because it is legislation that will be revisited within five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Creed. This matter relates to the arbitrary dismissal of seven estate officers by Government decision earlier this year, which I regard as very heavy handed. I am sure the Minister of State has been well briefed on the history in this regard by his personnel officer. Over a long number of years there have been attempts to negotiate an honourable outcome to the dissolution of the Land Commission and the redeployment to alternative, suitable areas of employment of estate officers who wish to remain in the Civil Service. What has happened, however, is that people have been offered alternative employment such as collecting fines in the courts service. These people have been engaged in outdoor activity, such as dealing with commonage and the consolidation of holdings. The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, in particular will understand the great work done by officials of the Land Commission in the west.</P>
      <P>There has been a general refusal by officials of the Department to negotiate an honourable settlement with the outstanding seven estate officers, which has an impact on their pay, allowances and career aspirations. These people have families. They have given great service to the Department and the Civil Service but now find themselves very frustrated. They are willing to negotiate but find the door has been shut in their faces by the Department following the Government decision. They have no redress other than to go to the High Court at their own expense. If they win a case in the High Court I am sure they will end up having to go to the Supreme Court at their own expense. It is unfair that the private individual has to take on the machinery of the State, which has the benefit of money from the Exchequer and taxpayers to fight its case.</P>
      <P>Over the years this has been the subject of investigation by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>In fact I know over the years that this has been the subject of investigation by the Public Accounts Committee. Mr. Dowling, the then Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, when asked at a Public Accounts Committee meeting why these people were not engaged in useful activity, said that they were ordered to go to work but to do nothing, because there was nothing for them to do if they did not want to take up alternative employment. That drifted on for years, until the Government decision earlier this year that they were no longer useful. I appeal to the Minister of State, to put aside his brief and all the problems with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and deal with the individuals and their families in an honourable way to negotiate a settlement.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing us to raise this matter on the Adjournment. The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, has a rightful reputation for being fair minded and having an independent streak. I have no doubt that he has been given a prepared script by his Department to deal with this issue. Will he stand back from it and consider the injustice of the manner in which the individuals involved in this case have been treated? It smacks of the heavy hand of the State crushing seven individuals who have been willing to continue to provide public service &ndash; who have in the past provided excellent public service &ndash; and who got caught in a transition period when the Land Commission was abolished. Through no fault of their own they were disallowed from further participation in the Civil Service. As my colleague, Deputy Hogan, said, they indicated on numerous occasions their willingness to negotiate a reasonable settlement to bring to a conclusion this long running saga.</P>
      <P>The individuals involved commissioned independent actuarial advice on this matter which showed clearly that the salaries on which their redundancies and pensions are based were artificially suppressed over a number of years. Notwithstanding the initial injustice of their summary dismissal, they have to put up with the added injustice of inadequate financial settlement from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This also brings into question a matter which is not the responsibility of the Minister of State &ndash;<Col N="553" /> how these men could be cast aside by their trade union; this is an issue for another forum. I am extremely disappointed with the way IMPACT handled this case on behalf of the seven individuals. Other colleagues were forced into doing tasks they were not previously involved in. These seven individuals, some of whom attempted to take up alternative duties, found it to be unsuitable and ultimately had to put up with the ignominy, as Deputy Hogan has said, of being obliged to turn up for work but being asked to do nothing. These men are willing to make an honourable settlement &ndash; seven individuals have been forced to come up with considerable financial resources to pursue their case through the court. That does not indicate that they are taking this matter lightly. It has inflicted a heavy toll on their personal lives and their sanity. I ask the Government and the Department to revisit this issue with the aim of bringing about an honourable settlement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the two Deputies for raising this issue. For reasons that will become apparent, I am obliged to stick to the prepared script this evening. I welcome the opportunity to explain the decision of the Government on this issue as there seems to be some misunderstanding on the subject. At the outset, I should say that I am aware from media reports that the individuals affected by the Government's decision obtained leave from the High Court on 25 June last to challenge the decision by way of application for judicial review. As is usual in such proceedings, the application for leave was made <i>ex parte</i>, that is, without the presence in court of any lawyers representing the State's interests. Accordingly I am not aware of the full nature and extent of the reliefs sought by the applicants or of the grounds upon which they seek to rely. Moreover, neither my Department nor the Chief State Solicitor has yet been served with the legal documents. In the circumstances, I am somewhat constrained in the extent to which I can comment on the matter having regard to the well established rules of this House governing the discussions of matters which are <i>sub judice</i>.</P>
      <P>The sub-professional grade of estates officer was established in 1969 to carry out some of the more routine duties of the Land Commission inspectorate. As their main duties involved the management of lands acquired by the Land Commission, their work diminished following the Government decision in 1984 to abolish the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By 1987, the residue of work on lands had virtually ceased and arrangements had to be made to redeploy these men to other work. There was no lands work available and as it was considered that this Department had sufficient staff, efforts <Col N="554" /> to find them alternative work were concentrated in other Departments. Following various attempts to assign them to alternative duties, on 1 May 1987 the Department of Finance redeployed all the serving estates officers as court clerks to the Department of Justice. There were 13 officers involved at that stage. This decision was not taken lightly and was the outcome of protracted negotiations with the Union of Professional Civil Servants, which represented the estates officers at the time. These assignments were actively chosen with a view to improving their remuneration, avoiding any geographical inconvenience and facilitating access to promotion posts. This latter point had always been a bone of contention with the estates officers as they had not heretofore enjoyed any promotion outlets. However, as the estates officers preferred to remain as estates officers, they objected to these assignments and sought a judicial review of the assignment decision.</P>
    <P>In January 1991, following an out-of-court settlement which was negotiated by the Department of Finance, the officers returned to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>At this stage, the Government had introduced the voluntary early retirement scheme and four of these men availed of the package, one died and one remained with the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>As was to be expected, no appropriate lands functions developed between 1987 and 1991. Thus when these officers returned to this Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the only viable option for their continuing employment was to redeploy them to alternative duties. This process was long, tedious and subject to voluminous legalistic arguments as the estates officers operated on the premise that the out-of-court settlement gave them an entitlement to continue to function as estates officers for the remainder of their careers. This was not acceptable to my Department. The emphasis of my Department at that time was to resolve the issue by offering the officers involved alternative duties.</P>
    <P>On 24 August 1992, these men were assigned to higher agricultural officer duties in meat plants as near as possible to their home locations. This offer was made following full discussions with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Finance. The officers objected to this offer as they considered these indoor duties as inappropriate. Following advice and discussions with the Office of the Attorney General two further offers were made in 1996 and 1998. These consisted of the option of an early retirement package or the choice of recertification as higher agricultural officers and assignment to outdoor duties on livestock or disease eradication schemes with headquarters near their home.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the estates officers were again given a <Col N="555" /> similar choice to that offered in 1996 but with more financially beneficial retirement terms. The offers in 1996 and 1998 indicated that if the choices offered were rejected the Department would have no alternative but to consider seeking the approval of the Government to terminate their services under the appropriate provisions of the Civil Service Regulation Acts.</P>
    <P>None of the offers made has been accepted and the net effect is that these seven officers continued to be paid by the State but without being gainfully employed. No lands work appropriate to their qualifications and experience materialised as the Commencement Order for the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1992, was signed on 31 March 1999.</P>
    <P>The State found itself in the untenable position of paying salary to these officers who are not gainfully employed and who had refused the reasonable offers of alternative employment offered. In the light of these circumstances, on 20 March 2001, the Government decided that the grade of estates officer should be abolished and the services of the seven remaining officers in the grade should be terminated under sections 5 and 17 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956.</P>
    <P>The terms available under sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963, grant of notional years of established service in consequence of the abolition of an officer's office, should be provided to the remaining officers on the estates officers salary scale. I hope this information, which is fairly comprehensive, is of use to the Deputies in explaining the factual background to this dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that your office, a Cheann Comhairle, facilitated both myself and Deputy Deenihan this evening and I am particularly glad the Minister is in the House. My concern is in relation to a broadcast on Kerry Radio last week quoting a Department source stating that this project is not on the short list of projects to be funded by the Minister under her programme. I remind the Minister that she met the organising group for the Tinteán Theatre Project, Ceoil Chiarraí, as the production company, and the North Kerry Arts, Culture and Heritage Society in 1997. When they visited her in her constituency, they explained to her that they had fund raised, particularly abroad, in relation to their project and that they had £100,000 saved. It is fair to quote the Minister as encouraging the deputation to keep on fund raising and to carry on with the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since that time, the company has put itself in a very sound financial situation. It has developed from a very small humble origin back in the 1980s. It has toured abroad, particularly Australia <Col N="556" /> and the United States, where it is very well established, and Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland and the Benelux countries. Through hard work and endeavour, it is a very well established company. When it met the Minister in 1997 &ndash; I think it was the only occasion &ndash; it only had £100,000, but it has greatly enhanced its situation. It has received a site from Kerry County Council in Ballybunion with a value of £250,000. It has fund raised £600,000 through its efforts and work abroad, which is in the bank. It also has a bank facility for £200,000. The overall cost of the project is in the region of £1.4 million.</P>
    <P>The application has been made to the Minister for a sum in the region of £650,000. While the area has some world renown in terms of the golf facilities, the seaside resort has not particularly benefited from the Celtic tiger or industrial development. It is extremely unlikely that Ballybunion will be assisted by or benefit from industrial development given the disadvantage Kerry is at in terms of the Border, midland and western regions. This is an opportunity for double assistance by way of Government grant.</P>
    <P>We are talking about over 80 permanent jobs. The company needs a base and the ideal place where it wants to be situated, in co-operation with the local authority, is Ballybunion. We are talking about a great opportunity. At present it is using a facility in Killarney where it has a show seven nights per week. It is successful but it is a temporary private family arrangement in Killarney. There are potential contracts with Paramount Studios. There is a possibility for a further 200 to 300 jobs for shows in the Paramount Studios theme parks all over the United States of America. It is what I would consider to be a very viable project. It is locally based, locally driven and well supported by the local community. Over 300 people attended a public meeting in Ballybunion last Monday at 4 p.m. because of the concern in the town and area regarding the broadcast that north Kerry would not benefit under the Minister's scheme which, I understand, will be announced in the next number of weeks.</P>
    <P>The business plan, which is extremely well prepared and thorough, holds out the very real prospect that what the company needs is a once-off capital grant to enable it to provide a base. It needs a facility of its own. At present it has 82 people in full-time employment from all parts of Kerry and abroad. It has a payroll bill of approximately £25,000 a week in the local economy. However, it needs a full-time training facility, particularly during the winter season. It needs a base in Ballybunion. It has registered charitable status and it is well located in the community.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to assure the House that its application is still under consideration. I would be surprised if an official of the Department gave out information to the effect that north Kerry was being excluded for any particular reason or <Col N="557" /> because there is another project in south Kerry and that only one project in Kerry will benefit. They are totally different as I understand the basis of the two projects. This is a very sustainable project offering jobs to an area to which, I am sure Deputy Deenihan will agree, it has been very difficult to attract overseas and local investment over the last number of years. It has benefited from the seaside resort scheme which we brought to Cabinet in the mid-1990s. That has had a certain benefit in Ballybunion.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say all Coalition Governments in recent years have encouraged people to fund raise, to raise capital locally and to have a good local support base. That is what we have in this project. We have good people who have organised and worked very hard and long hours to raise the money. I ask the Minister to give us an assurance that this project will receive consideration. I have no problem with the decision making process as long as this project is given a fair shake when it comes to the distribution on the basis of its viability, and this is a very viable project and a very necessary one for Ballybunion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing this matter on the Adjournment. It is the fifth occasion I have attempted to raise it on the Adjournment and I am delighted to have the opportunity to address this subject. The Tinteán Project at Ballybunion, County Kerry, is being promoted by the North Kerry Arts, Culture and Heritage Society Limited. The state of the art theatre, which will be the centrepiece of the Tinteán, will operate as an institute of contemporary traditional Irish dance with a professional dance company and as an advanced teaching and training centre for traditional Irish dance. The mission of the North Kerry Arts, Culture and Heritage Society Limited is to create and present traditional Irish dance in a contemporary format to a national and international audience and to encourage the participation in and performance of Irish traditional and contemporary dance and music in the south-west.</P>
      <P>Since 1985 dancers and musicians from the north Kerry area have toured with contemporary traditional Irish music and dance productions to such countries as Australia, New Zealand, the United Arab Emirates, the UK, Germany and to most other European countries. They received critical acclaim and enjoyed great success. In 1996, this group of dancers and musicians formed the Kerry Arts, Culture and Heritage Society Limited. The society is community based with its board of directors all living in the north Kerry area. I am honoured to be one of the directors of this society and I intend to do everything possible to ensure this project reaches fruition. The society has used Ballybunion as its base for a number of years and has recruited a number of dancers and musicians from the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> In 1999, the society initiated the Dance on the Moon production. This production was developed in co-operation with an associated professional contemporary dance company, Ceoil Chiarraí. The production was staged in the national event centre in Killarney in the summer of 2000 and attracted audiences of over 40,000. It has won critical acclaim from many experts, including a very positive endorsement from the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. The Tinteán will act as a performance centre for the society where audiences will be entertained by a professional dance troupe over the summer months. This will attract a new type of tourist to the area and, hopefully, will act as a catalyst for the revival and regeneration of Ballybunion, one of the oldest and most renowned of our traditional tourist seaside resorts.</P>
    <P>During the winter months, the Tinteán will become a training centre for the resident dance troupe when it is not on tour. It will also become a school for the teaching of traditional Irish dance under the direction of Ireland's top dance teachers. Young dancers from all parts of Ireland, the UK, the US and other parts of the world will come to Ballybunion to develop their dance skills under the guidance of these experts. This will provide a year-round tourism product for Ballybunion and will have a major spin-off effect in the local community.</P>
    <P>The society has engaged the services of one of Europe's top consultants in dance studios and theatre venues &ndash; London-based Burrell, Foley and Fisher who are also consultants to the Abbey Theatre. The Tralee Institute of Technology will enter into an arrangement with the society to use the facility to develop its courses.</P>
    <P>The total cost of this project will be in the region of £1.4 million. The society has raised £500,000 primarily from the profits of its various world wide productions. It also has the offer of a £250,000 loan facility from a local bank. The society applied to the Minister under the ACCESS programme for a grant of £600,000, a modest figure. I cannot imagine that many other groups which apply for funding have £500,000 in the bank and a guaranteed loan of £250,000.</P>
    <P>Having met its promoters, the Minister is very familiar with this exciting and innovative project. Mr. Micheál Carr, whom I commend for his energy and perseverance, has made representations to the Minister on a number of occasions. I appeal to the Minister to provide funding for this project. There will be a natural and positive synergy between this project and the proposed health and leisure centre in Ballybunion as professional dancers and dance students will use the fitness facilities in the new centre.</P>
    <P>The Minister, who recently opened a literary and cultural centre in Listowel, will be aware that north Kerry is steeped in heritage and culture and <Col N="559" /> this project offers an ideal opportunity to further capitalise on this great tradition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Spring and Deenihan for raising these matters. I have secured a total allocation of £36 million for the arts and culture enhancement support scheme &ndash; ACCESS &ndash; for the years 2001-04. The scheme's primary aim is to ensure that all citizens have easy access to adequate venues for the creation, expression, and appreciation of arts and culture, including heritage. This scheme will fit well with the current three-year arts plan of the Arts Council which I am funding to a level of £100 million.</P>
      <P>The scheme will assist the four main categories of arts and cultural infrastructure &ndash; arts centres, theatres, galleries, and museums and funds will be allocated under three broad strands, as follows: The regional, county and city projects strand will address the provision of large scale infrastructure development for arts and cultural facilities to meet the demonstrated needs of a region, county or city. Projects qualifying under this strand will include those which facilitate the development of strategic partnerships between local authorities, the arts sector and other key players while addressing the provision of workshop spaces, studios, rehearsal areas, education and community arts facilities.</P>
      <P>The strand dealing with the redevelopment of existing facilities and venues, including new build, additional build or major refurbishment will target existing arts and cultural operators to facilitate major refurbishment of existing facilities and venues. As with strand 1, operators will be encouraged to examine the possibility of entering into strategic partnerships with other operators in the field in order to share space and resources and maximise revenue funding.</P>
      <P>The community based projects strand will assist the development of smaller scale culture and arts facilities at local and community level, be they new facilities or the refurbishment of existing facilities.</P>
      <P>I announced details of the ACCESS programme in May 2000 and applications for grant assistance were invited in newspaper advertisements the following month. The deadline for receipt of applications was 31 October 2000 and by that date I had received more than 170 applications.</P>
      <P>The committee established by me to assess the applications for funding under the ACCESS programme, including the application for the Ballybunion project, recently completed its work. It is anticipated that a determination will be made in the near future as to which projects will be approved for grant assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important issue. That gardaí in the Clones area discovered a number of bombs, at least one of which was ready for action, in addition to command wires and other bomb-making equipment indicates the necessity for a strong Garda presence in County Monaghan which has the longest border of any county in Northern Ireland. The discovery of £56,000 worth of drugs in the same area suggests that the same paramilitary group may be dealing in both cannabis and ecstasy tablets to raise funds for their war. Few of us are in any doubt about the connections which existed in the past between drug barons and the use of arms.</P>
      <P>Is it not extraordinary that at this time, proposals are being advanced to break up the current Cavan-Monaghan division which serves all of County Monaghan, all of Cavan with the exception of the Darra and Blacklion areas which are separated physically by the Cuilcagh mountains, and small parts of Leitrim, Meath, Westmeath and Longford which physically, culturally and socially align with various districts in County Cavan?</P>
      <P>The present division was established at the time of the State's foundation. Cavan and Monaghan and parts of Leitrim have been at the centre of successful police action to combat the activities of subversives, north and south of the Border. Not only has the division served the people of Cavan and Monaghan, it has been instrumental in keeping the institutions of the State intact. The Cavan-Monaghan division is a similar entity to the political constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and has had one of the highest crime detection rates in the State over the past 30 years. It is ironic that at a time when efforts are being made to integrate the police and local communities in Northern Ireland, the Minister appears to be moving in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>I understand there are plans at senior Garda management level to change divisional boundaries without any consultation with members of the force, external agencies or the public. The preferred option of senior Garda management is the establishment of divisional headquarters in Dundalk for a new Louth-Monaghan division. Monaghan would, in that event, be reduced to the level of district headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a written reply on 26 June to a parliamentary question on Monaghan Garda headquarters, the Minister advised that &ldquo;there are no plans to upgrade this station or remove any of its existing responsibilities at this time&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;at this time&rdquo; concern me. Will the Minister give me a commitment that the Monaghan Garda headquarters are permanent? Over the past four years, Monaghan town has experienced the loss of St. Patrick's Agricultural College, Patten's <Col N="561" /> Mill, the temporary and possibly permanent closure of the maternity unit in the local hospital, the closure of the local swimming pool and the closure of Castleblayney military barracks.</P>
    <P>Any proposal the Garda Commissioner may have in this regard will be considered by the Minister's Department. He must make sure the divisional headquarters remains in Monaghan, otherwise there will be a 40% reduction in the permanent strength of the Garda at Monaghan headquarters.</P>
    <P>Monaghan, as a divisional headquarters, has 40% to 50% of its staff providing specialist services and its level of operational staff is higher than the level of a district headquarters, but if that was to change, no doubt 40 to 50 members of its staff would be lost to Dundalk over time, and that would severely impact on the economy of the area.</P>
    <P>Is this a further effort by the Government to provide extra jobs in an area where there are Ministers? The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has ensured that social welfare offices will be based in Dundalk and the IDA has located factories in Dundalk, but not in Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The old Garda barracks in Monaghan was restructured to provide offices for staff from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Social, Community and Family Affairs, but only local social welfare and existing farm building sections of the Departments use them. Inspectors or extra staff from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs did not move into them.</P>
    <P>If the new plans being prepared behind closed doors were implemented, I have no doubt they would have a major impact on the Cavan-Monaghan region, possibly leading to the closure of barracks and the further removal of gardaí from rural areas, never mind towns, at night.</P>
    <P>Ballybay, for instance, has to depend on gardaí in Castleblayney at night and if problems arose in the early hours of the morning in Ballybay and similar problems arose in Castleblayney, the people of Ballybay would have to wait.</P>
    <P>I depend on the Minister to make sure that nothing more is downgraded in Monaghan. In light of the bombs and all that happened in the Border region, I beg him to make sure that he does not allow this to happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to deal with the point raised by the Deputy about the need to reassess the requirements of the gardaí in the Border region in light of the threat posed by terrorist organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the issue of Garda strength. As the Deputy will appreciate, I am responsible for the overall provision of resources to the Garda Síochána, while the Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and <Col N="562" /> resources to individual areas. In respect of overall resources provided to the gardaí, the House will be well aware that since I took office the strength of the force has increased consistently. It has gone up from a figure of 10,800 in 1997 to a current situation where the number of gardaí now exceeds 11,600. Last year, the Government approved my proposals for a further Garda recruitment competition. This latest recruitment competition will fulfil the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the strength of the force to 12,000.</P>
    <P>As well as increasing the strength of the force, I have provided additional financial resources. The provision in the Garda Vote when I took office was £457 million, while the provision for this year is more than £690 million. This is a significant increase by any standards.</P>
    <P>It can be safely stated that never in the history of the State have more resources been allocated to combating crime, purchasing modern technology and equipment for the Garda Síochána and ensuring that the number of Garda personnel is increased. Furthermore, never in the history of the State have we had such a major prison building programme to ensure that those convicted of crime serve their sentences.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the Garda strength in the Border region, the Garda divisions of Donegal, Sligo-Leitrim, Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath police the Border. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the manpower strength of these divisions as at 4 July 2001 was 430, 263, 384 and 535, respectively. This represents a combined total of 1,612. I should also point out that these figures refer to manpower permanently assigned to the divisions in question and do not include members temporarily assigned because of the foot and mouth disease crisis. I am further informed that Garda management is satisfied that the resources available in the region are adequate to deal with security issues that arise.</P>
    <P>The level of Garda manpower assigned throughout the area in question, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>
    <P>Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the area with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained. When additional manpower next becomes available, the Deputy can be assured that the needs of the various divisions on the Border will be fully considered within the overall context of the need of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As I informed the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy O'Hanlon, there is no proposal to downgrade the Garda station in Monaghan, nor are <Col N="563" /> there are any proposals to close any Garda stations in County Monaghan. My ambition is to try to ensure Monaghan and Cavan, which are in the one constituency, benefit from the increase in the number of Garda Síochána and from the increased resources that have been made available to them and that they will have an enhanced role in policing within the relevant district.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to warmly congratulating and thank the gardaí in the Border regions for all the work they have done together with their colleagues who were drafted in to combat the foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Crawford, as I previously assured the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that there is no question of me having any proposals to <Col N="564" /> adversely interfere with the Garda Síochána or Garda stations in Cavan-Monaghan.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>I travelled to Scotland on 20 June for a one day official visit, which included engagements in both Edinburgh and Glasgow. During the visit, I met with the First Minister, Henry McLeish, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, Helen Liddel, as well as the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, John Reid.</P>
      <P>I had the honour of being among the first non-Scots to address the Scottish Parliament. My address to a session with a very full attendance of Members and of the public, focused on the rich history of cultural and social links between Ireland and Scotland and the opportunities now emerging significantly to enhance our relationship in the context of devolution and the institutional arrangements of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>In Glasgow, I gave a keynote address at the economic seminar &ldquo;Ireland and Scotland: Business Partners in the 21st Century&rdquo; which highlighted the trade links between the two countries and showcased a number of successful businesses working in both markets. This seminar, which was attended by about 400 business people was also addressed by the First Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland. In my address, I stressed that while we greatly value the historical links between the two countries, our primary focus is on building the relationship between today's Ireland and today's Scotland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After this event, the deputy chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Sir Angus Grossart, announced the repatriation to Ireland of a major painting of Daniel O'Connell by the renowned Scottish artist, David Wilkie. The painting is to be given on loan to the National Gallery of Ireland, before being put on permanent display in the Ulster Bank in O'Connell Street. Earlier in the day, I opened a new branch of the Bank of <Col N="566" /> Ireland in Edinburgh, at a function which was also addressed by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh.</P>
    <P>Later in the afternoon, I unveiled a memorial in Carfin dedicated to the remembrance of all those forced to leave Ireland during the Great Famine. On the way to Carfin, I called in at the offices of the Archdiocese of Glasgow to pay my respects to the late Cardinal Winning, who was lying in State there.</P>
    <P>The ceremony at Carfin was attended by a wide range of political leaders and representatives in Scotland and by Church leaders, including a representative of the Church of Scotland.</P>
    <P>His expressions of regret at the reception in Scotland sometimes afforded to Irish immigrants of the famine era, and also at later sectarianism, were appreciated by those present, including a large number of the public of Irish descent. The event at Carfin was followed by a civic reception in Motherwell, hosted by the North Lanarkshire Council.</P>
    <P>The visit proved very successful. In the light of the discussions which took place during my visit, I look forward to a significant strengthening of the relationship between Ireland and Scotland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 55 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, submitted to the EU on 1 June, provides an overview of a wide variety of initiatives being worked on by the Government to drive forward the social inclusion agenda, touching every aspect of Government.</P>
      <P>The plan is primarily grounded in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the national development plan, NDP, and the actions and spending commitments ensuing from these programmes. In particular, the plan reflects the state of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, NAPS, at present, as a work-in-progress, as outlined clearly to both the social partners and the EU Commission at the time of it's preparation. Future plans submitted to the EU will be consistent with, and contingent upon, the findings of the NAPS review and will also reflect EU developments in this area.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the EU guidelines, the plan outlines measures under a number of themes not previously emphasised in the NAPS, including the digital divide, access to justice and culture and family supports. The key issues that form the basis of the plan have emerged from the consultation process and from EU guidelines regarding the contents of the plan, which emphasised facilitating participation in employment and access by all to resources, rights, goods and services; preventing the risks of exclusion; helping the most vulnerable and mobilising all relevant bodies. In particular, the focus on the interaction between inequality and poverty is strengthened in the plan, including commitments to measure persistent poverty across the nine grounds outlined in the equality legislation. The plan also outlines new proposals for research on migrants, an area of policy that will be further strengthened through updating the NAPS analysis to include emerging causes of poverty such as racism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan also refers to proposed research to be commissioned by the Reception and Integration Agency which will identify how the needs of refugees are currently being met by existing services and obtain a complete inventory of organisations and groups, at all levels, which have, or might have the capability to be involved in integration initiatives. The purpose of the research is to inform the development of a comprehensive <Col N="568" /> strategy for the implementation of integration policy.</P>
    <P>The National Action Plan Against Poverty and Social Inclusion, 2001-2003, is the first in a series, running up to 2007, which will outline measures towards eliminating poverty and social exclusion. The development of each subsequent national action plan will provide further opportunities for review of this first plan and for evaluation of the effectiveness of the NAPS and its ongoing development.</P>

      <P>The Programme For Prosperity and Fairness contains a commitment that the establishment of a social insurance board with representation from the social partners will be examined over the lifetime of the programme.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the social insurance fund is in a healthy financial situation at present. The surpluses which have emerged since 1997 onwards require careful management in order to ensure that they are used to best advantage having regard to emerging demands and the overall interest of its contributors.</P>
      <P>It was announced at budget time that the Minister for Finance and I will, during the course of this year, conduct an examination of possible strategies in this regard. In order to inform such an examination, my Department has engaged external consultants to conduct an actuarial review of the social insurance fund for the period 2001 to 2056 and this work is already under way.</P>
      <P>This review will build on the findings of the 1997 review in relation to social insurance based pensions as well as dealing, for the first time, with short-term benefits. It is envisaged that the review will be completed by October next.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the review will inform short to medium and long-term policy development in relation to the social insurance system generally and the emerging surpluses of recent years. It will also directly feed into the examination of possible roles of a social insurance board and the social partners will be fully consulted as part of this process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 48, 71, 75, 78, 213 and 214 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a means tested payment for carers on low income who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.</P>
      <P>The most recent estimate of the number of full-time carers has been provided by the results of the census pilot survey carried out by the Central Statistics Office, CSO. This survey was carried out in September 1999 and is based on a sample of 8,000 households in which persons aged 15 years or over were asked if they provided unpaid personal help for someone with a long-term illness, health problem or disability, including problems due to old age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> The detailed results are as follows; 35,000 people provide more than 50 hours unpaid personal help per week, or seven hours per day; 17,000 people provide 20-49 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between three and seven hours per day; 79,000 people provide 1-19 hours unpaid personal help per week, or between nine minutes and 2.5 hours per day.</P>
    <P>These results are consistent with the figure of 50,000 full-time carers as estimated in the review of the carer's allowance. It also explains the estimate of 120,000 carers used by the carer organisations which I have consistently said was due to the definition they were using of carer, as someone who visits or assists a person, but who does not provide full-time care. I have asked the CSO to consider using a more detailed breakdown of these hours when conducting the census next year.</P>
    <P>There are almost 17,300 carers in receipt of carer's allowance. These figures show that more than 33% of the 52,000 carers, as estimated by the CSO to be caring for more than three hours per day, are in receipt of carer's allowance. This is an increase of almost 88% in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance since this Government took office and, indeed, it should also be noted that the expected increase of another 5,000 carers following the recent increases in income disregards will increase this percentage to 42% of all carers who are providing more than three hours care per day.</P>
    <P>This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carer's allowance, which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £108.4 million next year, representing an increase of almost 200%.</P>
    <P>In budget 2001, in addition to the substantial weekly rate increases of £8 for carers aged under 66 and £10 for carers aged over 66, I also announced a number of other measures to support carers. In particular, I made provision for a substantial increase from April 2001 in the weekly income disregards in the carer's allowance means test from £75 to £125 for a single person and from £150 to £250 for a couple. As I have already mentioned, this will enable more than 5,000 new carers to qualify for carer's allowance and almost 3,000 existing carers to receive an increased payment. The effect of this increase will ensure that a couple with two children, earning a joint income in the region of £15,100, will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance while a couple in receipt of £26,000 will qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and respite care grant.</P>
    <P>The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes and the measures that I have introduced further enhance the qualification criteria for this scheme. As I announced in my budget speech, I envisage moving towards what I see as the optimum situation, <Col N="571" /> whereby all carers, whose joint family income is at average industrial earnings, will qualify for carer's allowance at the maximum rate.</P>
    <P>In view of the many supports required by carers, particularly in community care and respite care, I do not consider that abolition of the means test, at a cost in the region of £180 million, is the best way to support carers or the best use of resources.</P>
    <P>The review of the carer's allowance, published in October 1998, considered the purpose and development of the carer's allowance scheme, both in terms of its current operation and its future development. It examined a wide range of issues including the payment of carer's allowance in conjunction with another social welfare payment. In this regard, the review estimated that approximately 65% of carers qualifying for carer's allowance were in receipt of another social welfare payment, either in their own right or as a qualified adult on their spouse's payment. This would not be the situation today due to the increased income disregards I have introduced that allow carers on higher joint family incomes to qualify.</P>
    <P>The review examined the purpose of the carer's allowance and concluded that it is an income support payment and not a payment or caring. It noted that the primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual to ensure that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one individual. Therefore, the review concluded that two income support payments should not be made, in line with current practice. Of course, a person qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The review did propose the introduction of a non-means tested &ldquo;continual care&rdquo; payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It envisaged that this payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency. In order to differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the &ldquo;continual care&rdquo; payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment. It was considered that a needs assessment would separate care needs from income support needs and could be used by all State organisations which provide reliefs or grants to those in need of care.</P>
    <P>Establishing a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme. This area is the responsibility of my colleague, Dr. Tom Moffatt, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> With regard to the recent research report, &ldquo;Listening to the Voice of Carers&rdquo;, which was published by the South-Eastern Health Board, I welcome all publications which highlight the issues of concern to carers. Some of the issues raised relate to co-ordination of services for carers and to the lack of information available to carers regarding their entitlements.</P>
    <P>Many of the issues relating to the co-ordination of services on the ground are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children and the individual health boards. However, I would like to remind Deputies that the Government has already pledged to put in place a co-ordinated approach addressing the needs of carers. One of the key priorities we set was to develop a partnership model to facilitate the development by the State, in conjunction with the private sector, of an improved system for meeting long-term care costs. To this end, I initiated a consultancy study on the future financing of long-term care. The study, which is currently under way, is examining the strategic issues involved and involves an assessment of alternative financing and funding approaches and their feasibility in the Irish context. The study also involves the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance. I would also like to remind the House that my officials worked closely with officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to introduce the carer's benefit and, most recently, the Carer's Leave Act which was enacted this week and will benefit many carers, who can now take leave of absence from their employment to care full-time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of information, Deputies should note that my Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets covering each social welfare payment or scheme and these are widely available at local level from my Department, from post offices and from other organisations.</P>
    <P>At the end of last year, more than 16,000 carers and more than 100,000 people with disabilities received a customised information booklet outlining the support available from the various Government Departments. Most recently a mailshot issued to all households in the State to ensure that those who are not currently receiving benefits or pensions are made aware of their entitlements and of other relevant services.</P>
    <P>Changes and improvements to schemes and services are advertised, using an appropriate mix of national and provincial media, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots. Selective use is also made of freephone services to provide information and advice on the introduction of new schemes or, for example, at budget time. Another initiative undertaken by my Department is a website through which the public can access information on the Department's services.</P>
    <P>The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the <Col N="573" /> types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements to the carer's allowance and for carers generally will be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of our key priorities in the care area, as set out in the review of our action programme.</P>

These include: the Pensions Bill, which will provide for the regulation of occupational pensions and the legislative framework for the implementation of recommendations contained in the Pension Board's report &ldquo;Securing Retirement Income&rdquo;&ndash; the text of the Bill will be published shortly; the civil registration Bill which will provide for reform of the existing births, marriages and deaths registration legislation, and underpin the modernisation of the Civil Registration Service &ndash; it is hoped to publish the text of the Bill later this year; the family support agency Bill, will provide for the establishment of a new body to be known as the family support agency to exercise a range of functions, including the provision of a family mediation service, the promotion and development of marriage and relationship counselling services and of other family support services and to support, promote and develop the family and community services resource centres &ndash; the new body will provide financial assistance, subject to ministerial consent to voluntary organisations providing these services and it is anticipated that the Bill will be published later this month; the money advice and budgeting service Bill will provide the legislative framework for the money advice and budgeting service &ndash; MABS &ndash; established under the auspices of my Department in response to problems of moneylending and overindebtedness.</P>
      <P>I believe that it is now opportune to provide a firm statutory basis for the service in order to demonstrate the Government's commitment to the service and to secure its continuity into the future. It is anticipated that the Bill will be published later this year; the fundraising for charitable and other purposes bill will provide for reform of the existing law relating to the administration and regulation of charities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the current situation has been initiated, and, pending completion of the review, <Col N="574" /> publication of the Bill has been tentatively scheduled for mid-2002; the public service broker Bill the REACH agency, which was established in September 2000, is a cross-departmental agency established to improve the quality of service to customers of the public service. The particular mandates of REACH are to develop a framework to integrate public services and to specify and establish a single gateway to Government &ndash; the public services broker.</P>
    <P>The public services broker is a new model for the electronic delivery of public services intended to simplify transactions between customers and the public service by providing common services to both the customer and public service agencies. Work is under way on the preparation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I also intend to bring forward legislation in the form of the annual Social Welfare Bill to implement the increases in weekly social welfare payments to be announced in the forthcoming budget, with effect from January 2002, and other budgetary improvements in social welfare schemes.</P>

      <P>The widow and widower's pension schemes are designed to recognise the particular difficulties that arise following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>Since April of this year the maximum rate of widow and widower's contributory pension has been £89.10 per week for those aged under 66 years of age. The corresponding rate of widow and widower's non-contributory pension is £85.50 per week.</P>
      <P>In line with the Government's commitment to pensioners and as announced in budget 2001, I decided to increase the widow and widowers's contributory pension for recipients aged 66 or over to the full old age, contributory, pension rate over two budgets. The special increase of £12.90 per week which came into effect in April is the first step in this process. The maximum rate of widow(er)'s contributory pension is now £102 per week for those aged over 66. The corresponding weekly rate of widow and widower's non contributory pension is £95.50.</P>
      <P>The increases in the rates of child benefit which came into effect this month are of benefit to widows and widowers with children. Monthly child benefit payments are now £67.50 per month for each of the first and second children and £86 per month for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widowed people are also benefiting from changes in the free schemes which I announced in budget 2001 and which came into effect in <Col N="575" /> May. Under these new arrangements all persons aged over 70 years of age are entitled to the full range of schemes regardless of their means or household composition.</P>
    <P>A working group was established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to examine the range of issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments. The level of payments to widows or widowers will be examined in the context of that working group. I understand that the group is aiming to conclude its deliberations at the end of this month and I believe the final report will be presented shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>In addition, the position with regard to social welfare provision for widowed people will be kept under review in the context of overall budgetary considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new Government special savings incentive scheme which came into operation on 1 May 2001 allows savers to save between £10 and £200 a month amounting to between £200 and £12,000 over a five year period. Under the scheme the Government guarantees the saver £1 for every £4 saved. Savers must be over 18, resident in this country and have a PPS number.</P>
      <P>All social assistance payments are subject to a means test. The purpose of the means test is to ensure that limited resources are directed towards those with little, if any, additional income. For the purposes of assessing means, any savings which a person might have are treated as capital and are assessed along with the value of property and any cash income.</P>
      <P>Under the current arrangements for assessing capital for all social assistance schemes except supplementary welfare allowance: the first £10,000 is disregarded; capital between £10,000 and £20,000 is assessed on the basis of £1 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; capital between £20,000 and £30,000 is assessed on the basis of £2 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; and capital above £30,000 is assessed on the basis of £4 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no immediate plans to introduce special means testing arrangements for the special savings incentive scheme. In view of the level of incomes of people on social assistance payments it is envisaged that they would be <Col N="576" /> unlikely to save more than £10,000 under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Any further relaxation of the means test would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context, in light of available resources and having regard to the Government's other priorities.</P>

      <P>My Department's employment support services consists of three pillars which are designed to assist and encourage long-term unemployed and other long-term welfare recipients to return to work, training or further education.</P>
      <P>The first pillar is the &ldquo;Back To Work&rdquo; allowance scheme which incentivises and encourages long-term unemployed people, lone parents and certain people with disabilities to return to work by allowing them to retain part of their social welfare payment when they take up employment or self-employment.</P>
      <P>Last year I introduced an enhanced version of this scheme specifically targeted at people who had been five years or more on the Live Register. People participating in this can avail of a six week training period either on or off the job and during this period receive a top up of £35 a week in addition to their weekly unemployment payment. When they take up employment they will be paid a bonus of £200 and a further payment also of £200 after they have completed six months work.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Back to Work&rdquo; allowance scheme has been highly successful since its introduction and to date more than 75,000 people, the vast majority of whom were previously long-term unemployed, have taken part in the scheme. Currently there are more than 36,000 participants in the scheme, approximately half of whom are engaged in a wide range of self employment options.</P>
      <P>The second pillar of my Department's employment support service is the &ldquo;Back to Education&rdquo; allowance programme. This is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities to improve their skills and qualifications with a view to returning to the work force. Courses covered under the scheme range from second level through to third level postgraduate courses of study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases where a person's choice of course falls outside the realm of formal second and third level courses for which the &ldquo;Back to Education&rdquo; allowance is payable, he or she can avail of approved <Col N="577" /> courses of education, training and development. Participants on these courses may continue to receive their social welfare payments for the duration of the course.</P>
    <P>The final pillar consists of the Departments locally based jobs facilitators. Their primary role is to assist long-term unemployed people and other long-term welfare dependants back to work, training or further education by providing them on an individual basis with assistance to access the necessary programmes or supports which their circumstances demand.</P>
    <P>My Department's employment support services have been very successful in assisting people away from the cycle of long-term unemployment and back into the workforce. The services provided are under constant review and I am satisfied as to their continued relevance and flexibility in today's job market.</P>
    <P>My Department actively co-operates with other agencies involved in assisting people to make the transition from unemployment to work. We work very closely with FÁS in the operation of the employment action plan at both national and local level and the success of this plan to date is due in no small way to the good working relationship which exists between our organisations.</P>
    <P>Changes to FÁS schemes are a matter primarily for my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Consultation takes place as a matter of routine between our organisations where changes impact directly on my Departments programmes or where they require the co-operation of my Department.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question refers to my Department's bereavement grant scheme. This scheme was introduced on 2 February 1999 as a replacement for the former death grant scheme. The scheme is designed to alleviate the cost of funeral expenses and provide for significant improvements in the following areas: an increase from £100 to £500 in the level of the grant; extension of the scheme to include the self-employed and people covered by the modified rate of social insurance e.g. public servants &ndash; previously the scheme was largely confined to employees paying a full rate PRSI contribution; a substantial easement of the contribution conditions to ensure that as many people as possible would qualify; and the automatic entitlement to the grant on the death of a person receiving a contributory pension or his or her spouse or qualified dependants, or a person receiving orphan's contributory allowance or his or her guardian.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> Following the introduction of the new scheme, the number of bereavement grants made increased from 9,675 in 1998 to almost 22,000 in 2000. In 1998, expenditure on the old funeral grant scheme amounted to £958,000. This increased to almost £11 million in 2000. The total number of grants awarded and the expenditure on the scheme for each year since its introduction is as follows: </P>

      <P>Since 1996, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant-aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme grants for the following equipment are provided for: small-scale physical security equipment such as, strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and door locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarms systems, such as the &ldquo;panic button&rdquo; pendant which is worn around the neck or wrist and operated <i>via</i> the telephone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be eligible for grant-aid under the scheme, individuals must be aged 65 and over and living alone or living in households made up exclusively <Col N="579" /> of older people, or of older people and other people who are dependent and vulnerable; and unable to install or purchase the equipment concerned themselves.</P>
    <P>Since its commencement, a total of £22 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2000 has assisted some 82,000 individuals. I am committed to ensuring that this scheme continues to address the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in our society and accordingly a sum of £3.5 million has been provided for the scheme in my Department's Estimates for 2001.</P>
    <P>The scheme was reviewed in 1999 and there are no plans to amend the scheme. A detailed breakdown of all the grants paid under the scheme is available in the Oireachtas Library for the Deputy's information.</P>

      <P>It has been the practice of this Government to give real increases to social welfare recipients. While the rate of inflation is not easy to predict, if inflation is higher than the estimated figure for a particular year, account is taken of that in the following budget. This approach has ensured that, over the term of this Government, social welfare rates have increased well above the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of the future indexation or uprating of welfare payments is amongst those being considered at present by the social welfare benchmarking and indexation group. This group, which was established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, PPF, is required by its terms of reference to: examine the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or <Col N="580" /> indexation of payments, having regard to their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns; and examine the issue of relative income poverty.</P>
    <P>The group has been meeting fortnightly since December 2000 and produced an interim report at the end of April. The group is aiming to complete its work by the end of this month and it is envisaged that its final report will be produced shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>Given that the group was specifically established under the terms of the PPF to examine the issues involved, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to seek to pre-empt its findings at this stage. I can assure the Deputy, however, that careful consideration will be taken of the conclusions reached by the group once its work has been completed, both in the context of the forthcoming budget and in the wider context of the development of welfare policy generally.</P>

      <P>The Dormant Accounts Bill, 2001 was introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance on 23 May 2001. The Bill was passed by Dáil Éireann on Friday last and I look forward to its passage through the Seanad and its early enactment.</P>
      <P>The core objective of the legislation is to put account holders or their heirs or successors in touch with their dormant accounts in financial institutions. The scheme provided for will commence next April and will oblige banks, building societies and the post office to make contact with all customers whose accounts have become &ldquo;dormant&rdquo;, i.e. where there has been no customer initiated transactions on the account for 15 years or more.</P>
      <P>If the owners of accounts which have been dormant for 15 years or more, as at 31 March 2002, have not come forward by the end of March 2003 to reclaim their moneys, the balances in the accounts will be transferred to a &ldquo;Dormant Accounts Fund&rdquo; to be established and managed by the National Treasury Management Agency. The transfer of moneys will take place on the basis that the beneficial owners of them will have a guaranteed right of reclaim to their property at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fund will be managed by the agency for two purposes &ndash; first, to meet claims for refunds <Col N="581" /> from owners and, secondly, to make payments under a scheme of disbursement. I will appoint the members of the &ldquo;Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursement Board&rdquo; whose remit will be to oversee a scheme for disbursement of surplus dormant funds, based on guidelines given by me. The other powers I will have include: the appointment of an inspector to ensure compliance by the financial institutions with the legislation, issuing directions and guidelines to the National Treasury Management Agency in relation to the preparation of an investment plan, extension of the legislation to other types of accounts and, provision of secretarial and administrative support to the board.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the summer report of the Central Bank, which forecasts a minimum inflation rate of 4.75% for 2001, he will urgently consider a compensation package for social welfare recipients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>At £850 million, last December's social welfare budget allocation is the biggest ever and more than double last year's welfare package. This allocation will, to an unprecedented extent, direct the resources of the State at the needs of our disadvantaged citizens and communities.</P>
      <P>Among the most significant of these improvements were an increase of £10 per week for pensioners, and £8 for other social welfare recipients. Additional increases were given to couples.</P>
      <P>The £10 increase for pensioners represents an increase ranging between 10.4% and 11.7%, while the £8 general increase represents an increase ranging between 9% and 10.5%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual average increase in the consumer <Col N="582" /> price index is the benchmark against which increases in social welfare payments have normally been compared. It was predicted that the average inflation figure for 2001 will be 4.5%. Even if this figure were to be exceeded to the extent forecast recently by the Central Bank it is clear that this year's rate increases will represent substantial real increases.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as part of the process of aligning tax and social welfare changes by 2001, all of these increases have been paid four weeks earlier this year, from the beginning of April.</P>
    <P>Significant increases in monthly child benefit are also being provided for families with children &ndash; £25 for each of the first two qualified children and £30 for each other qualified child. These increases, which range between 53.6% and 58.8%, also represent substantial real increases.</P>
    <P>Social welfare rates have improved significantly in real terms since this Government took up office. Over our four budgets to date we have, for example, increased the old age contributory pension by £28 per week, a 19.1% real increase, as compared to £7 per week &ndash; a 4% real increase in the same payment over the three budgets introduced by the Rainbow Coalition.</P>
    <P>The significant social welfare improvements which we have already made amount cumulatively to more than £1.8 billion in a full year since we came into office. These, together with the further improvements to which we are committed over the coming years, amply deliver on our guarantee that everyone will share in the benefits of social and economic developments.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs in September 1999 is based on the report &ldquo;Towards a Senior Euro Pass&rdquo;, which was commissioned by the Social Affairs Directorate of the European Commission. It was undertaken and published by Age Concern, England at the end of 1997. It recommends that EU states should establish a senior euro pass card which would entitle older people to concessions on various services, including travel, cultural and social activities. However, I understand that further work on this issue has been suspended at EU level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of my Department in matters relating to the senior euro pass is to submit observations, <Col N="583" /> as required, in conjunction with other Departments, statutory and non-statutory bodies on any action taken to implement the proposals in this report, in so far as they affect the business of this Department. The administration of the euro pass itself is outside the remit of my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations governing both invalidity pension and disability benefit schemes first require that a person does not engage in employment during periods of incapacity. It is nonetheless recognised that support should be provided for people with disabilities or long-term incapacities to facilitate them in taking up available employment and training opportunities, where appropriate.</P>
      <P>Under existing provisions, invalidity pensioners and certain disability benefit customers can, subject to prior approval from my Department, engage in occupational training where they are incapable of following their usual occupation. They may also engage in rehabilitative or therapeutic employment. Disability benefit recipients must generally be receiving payment for at least six months before application for approval is considered.</P>
      <P>Since the transfer of training and employment services from the National Rehabilitation Board to FÁS, my Department has entered into arrangements with FÁS to assist people on disability payments who wish to engage in training or rehabilitative employment. As outlined in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the new employment and training arrangements will have, as a priority, clear progression routes for people with disabilities from sheltered work, supported work and employment to employment options in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>Where certification is received by FÁS that an invalidity pensioner or a disability benefit recipient wishes to undertake rehabilitative training or employment, they are, subject to certain conditions, allowed to retain their full invalidity and disability payments as well as any related secondary benefits whilst engaging in FÁS training or community employment schemes.</P>
      <P>In the case of disability benefit, applications for approval to take up training or part-time employment are first referred to the medical adviser of my Department for his opinion on the rehabilitative potential of the work-training involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of a package of measures to further enhance the employment supports for people with disabilities, I introduced in last year's budget two further important improvements for inval<Col N="584" /> idity pensioners. First, the &ldquo;Back to Work&rdquo; allowance scheme was extended to invalidity pensioners in June 2000. From July 2001 I am introducing a pilot &ldquo;Back to Work&rdquo; scheme for up to 200 persons who have been receiving disability benefit for five years or more. Participants in this scheme can take up employment and continue to receive their social welfare payment on a sliding scale over a three year period or for four years if they take up self-employment.</P>
    <P>I extended the &ldquo;Back to Education&rdquo; allowance to invalidity pensioners with effect from June 2000. Participants in this scheme can continue to receive their full weekly payment while undergoing approved second or third level education courses. In addition, a &ldquo;Cost of Education&rdquo; allowance of £200 is paid towards the cost of books and related expenses.</P>
    <P>The range of employment, training and educational supports provided by my Department for people with disabilities continues to be developed. My Department has been endeavouring to ensure that the social welfare system does not act as a disincentive for people with disabilities to take up available training and employment opportunities. The system is being adapted from one of passive support to a position of facilitation for people with disabilities who wish to take up such supports including progression to open labour market activity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 211 together.</P>
      <P>Since responsibility for the main means-tested payment for people with disabilities, i.e. the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme, was transferred from the health boards to my Department in October 1996, a range of significant improvements, including improvements in the means-testing arrangements, have been introduced. As a consequence, there has been a substantial increase in the number of recipients of disability allowance &ndash; up from 34,500 in October 1996 to 56,221 at the end of May 2001, an increase of 63%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main improvements in the means-testing arrangements which have been provided for, and which also apply to the means-tested blind per<Col N="585" /> son's pension scheme, include a substantial increase in the amount of earnings from rehabilitative employment which may be disregarded for means test purposes. The level of this disregard has more than doubled, from £35.20 to £75 and it has also been extended to earnings from rehabilitative self-employment; a major improvement in the method of assessing capital was introduced in October 2000, with the first £10,000 being disregarded, an increase of £8,000, and the method of assessing capital above this level improved; since April of this year the full rate disability allowance is paid where the person's partner is in receipt of any other social welfare payment. This improvement has resulted in weekly increases of between £35 and £46 for those affected; up to £150,000 from the proceeds of the sale of a person's residence is exempted for disability allowance and blind person's pension purposes, with effect from April of this year.</P>
    <P>In addition, the &ldquo;Back to Work&rdquo; scheme has been extended to recipients of disability allowance and blind person's pension.</P>
    <P>Under this scheme a person is allowed to retain their weekly payment on a sliding scale in addition to their income from employment or self-employment.</P>
    <P>While significant improvements have been made in the means-tested payments for people with disabilities in recent years, it is nevertheless recognised that more needs to be done and I will continue to examine the potential for further improvements in this area, having regard to available resources and the Government's other priorities.</P>

One of the key features of the legislation is the provision of a legislative framework for the introduction of personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, to facilitate increased savings for pensions and to provide a vehicle to extend supplementary pensions coverage overall, especially to people who have no such cover at present.</P>
      <P>At this stage it is not possible to be definitive about the commencement date for PRSAs as this will depend on enactment of the legislation. However, I would hope that these will be available very early in 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are currently three different rates of child dependant allowances payable to social welfare recipients, ranging from £13.20 per week to £17.00 per week. Since the time of the report of the commission on social welfare, which recommended a rationalisation of the rates of child dependant allowances, the number of different rates has been reduced from 36 down to the current three. Further rationalisation would be extremely costly; the cost of paying all child dependant allowances at the highest rate currently paid is estimated to be over £48 million per annum.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities. The policy direction followed by successive Governments has therefore been to concentrate resources for child income support on child benefit. Unlike child dependant allowances, child benefit does not contribute to poverty traps or work disincentives, as it is a universal payment which is not subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>The value of the child benefit scheme as an effective mechanism for the provision of child income support is reflected in the substantial investment which the Government makes in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> Before we came to office, expenditure on child benefit was £397 million annually. Our first three budgets increased this to £575 million &ndash; an increase of more than 40%. The increases in the basic rates of child benefit of £25 and £30 per month respectively which were paid in June represent a further full-year investment in the scheme of almost £330 million.</P>
    <P>With increases of the same order due in each of the next two years, by the end of 2003, Government investment in the scheme will have increased by an additional £1 billion. This means that we will have moved from a position in 1994 where 70% of child income support for a family claiming social welfare payments was in the form of child dependant allowances to a position in 2003 where child dependant allowances will account for less than 33%.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I believe that investment in the child benefit scheme is the correct approach and represents the most effective use of the resources available for child income support.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that a child dependant allowance will be paid in respect of about 350,000 children in 2001. A breakdown of the number in each category is provided in the following tabular statement. Child benefit is currently paid in respect of over 1 million children.</P>

The increases in the basic rates of child benefit of £25 and £30 per month respectively which were paid in June represent a further full-year investment in the scheme of almost £330 million. Some 532,000 <Col N="588" /> families with over one million children will have benefited directly from the increases.</P>
    <P>With increases of the same order due in each of the next two years, Government investment in the scheme will have increased by an additional £1 billion in the period 2001-03. This means that the PPF commitment to move towards child benefit rates of £100 per month for third and subsequent children, will have been substantially exceeded a year ahead of target in 2002.</P>
    <P>The child benefit scheme is designed to contribute towards the additional costs faced by those with children. I am confident, that the improvements in child benefit this year and over the next two years, will significantly enhance the level of support for families with children.</P>

      <P>My Department has a comprehensive control programme in place to ensure that fraud and abuse is kept to a minimum and that only those who are entitled to a payment actually receive it. All Department staff who are involved in making payments are aware of and concerned with the prevention of incorrect payments and the detection of abuse. In addition there are some 600 staff who are specifically involved in control activity as members of scheme control units, investigators or medical assessors.</P>
      <P>The investigative staff and control units, one of which works in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, carry out inspections of employers, investigate cases of concurrent working and claiming, assess means in non-contributory cases and review the ongoing entitlement of recipients. In the case of unemployment payments all new claimants are made aware of the conditions governing receipt of payment and their obligation in regard to availability for and genuinely seeking work and these aspects continue to be reviewed on a regular basis during the claim's duration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the employment action plan, persons who reach various duration thresholds on the live register are identified and referred to FÁS for interview with a view to job placement or offer of <Col N="589" /> training. This programme now covers all persons under 25 years at six months on the live register and those from 25 to 54 years at nine months on the live register.</P>
    <P>The total savings from the Department's control programme, which embraces a vast range of activities to prevent, deter and detect fraud, abuse and omissions in the various schemes, amounted to some £214 million in the year 2000 of which £106.95 million was in respect of unemployment payments. The total of overpayments in respect of fraud or suspected fraud amounted to £11.25 million representing 12,625 cases &ndash; of these £7.4 million representing 11,493 cases were in respect of unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>In the nature of fraud, especially social welfare fraud, it is exceedingly difficult to offer a definitive assessment of its prevalence. However, having regard to the efforts employed by my Department to discourage fraudulent claiming in the first instance and the rigorous and sustained activation of a multi-faceted control programme I am confident that everything possible is being done to minimise fraud and fraudulent opportunities generally.</P>
    <P>All cases of social welfare fraud by individuals or failure by employers to comply with their legal obligations are considered for criminal prosecution. Last year a total of 269 cases, of which 220 were in respect of unemployment customers, were referred to the Chief State Solicitor's office for legal proceedings. Of these 213 cases were finalised and a conviction was obtained in all except 14 cases.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, social welfare fraud at any level is not acceptable and apart from the obligation to protect taxpayers' money I am concerned to ensure that compliant employers, employees and scheme recipients are not disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>For that reason the effectiveness of the control approach is regularly monitored and adjustments made as appropriate.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for social insurance credits: a person must have previously worked and paid PRSI; if a person has no PRSI contributions paid or credited for more than two full contribution years, they must return to work and pay PRSI contributions for at least 26 weeks; as credits are linked to specific circum<Col N="590" /> stances, such as illness or unemployment, a person must provide relevant evidence of these circumstances. For example, a person claiming credits on the basis of illness would be required to submit medical certificates. Similarly, a person claiming credits on the basis of unemployment would be required to meet certain criteria, such as showing their availability for work. These conditions apply to both men and women.</P>
      <P>The purpose of social welfare credits is to secure the PRSI entitlements of insured workers, who are temporarily outside the paid workforce for reasons such as unemployment, illness etc., in a manner which is consistent with the continued viability of the social insurance fund. Given that the award of credits can give entitlement to a range of social insurance benefits, provided that a certain number of paid contributions have been made, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is necessary to have some limitations on such award.</P>
      <P>A separate arrangement exists to protect the long-term social insurance pensions of people, mainly women, who give up paid employment for periods of caring. From 6 April 1994 periods of time spent out of the workforce, including self employment caring either for children aged up to 12 years or incapacitated people are disregarded when calculating a person's pension entitlements. The maximum period which can be disregarded is 20 years. An examination of the homemaker's scheme is being undertaken as part of the review of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions and I expect to have a report later this year, which I will examine in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>I should also refer to a number of recent initiatives in the pensions area. These include the reduction in the average number of PRSI contributions required for pension purposes to ten and the payment of a special half rate pension for those with pre-53 insurance contributions. These measures have made it easier for people, including women, with reduced or broken insurance records to receive a contributory pension.</P>

      <P>It is projected that the social insurance fund will have an annual surplus in the years 2001 and 2002 of £434 million and £772 million, respectively. The cumulative surplus is projected to be £1,015 and £1,877 million, respectively, at the end of the years in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the figures for the potential annual and cumulative surpluses for 2002 do not take <Col N="591" /> into account increases, in excess of prices inflation, in the rates of social insurance benefits and pensions or other changes which may be introduced in the next budget. In this regard, the Government has entered into a commitment with the social partners as part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to increase the rates of all social welfare payments in real terms over the lifetime of the programme. Clearly, this and other developments are likely to have a significant impact on any emerging surpluses in 2002 and subsequent years.</P>
    <P>As the figures indicate, the social insurance fund is in a healthy financial situation at the moment. The surplus is retained in the fund's investment account and invested for the benefit of contributors generally. This surplus will not continue indefinitely as ageing of the population will greatly increase demands on the fund over the medium to long term. Clearly, it is important that the fund's surplus should be used to best advantage having regard to emerging demands and the overall interest of its contributors.</P>
    <P>As announced at budget time, the Minister for Finance and I will, during the course of this year, conduct an examination of possible strategies in this regard. In order to inform such an examination, my Department has engaged external consultants to conduct an actuarial review of the social insurance fund and this work is already under way. This review will build on the findings of the 1997 review in relation to social insurance based pensions as well as dealing, for the first time, with short-term benefits. It is envisaged that the review will be completed by October next and that the outcome will inform short to medium and long-term policy development in relation to the social insurance system generally as well as the emerging surpluses of recent years.</P>

      <P>The introduction of the new euro currency from 1 January next marks one of the most significant events of our membership of the European Community. From an information perspective, it presents us with a major challenge to ensure that all our citizens are aware of the changeover and the implications for themselves in their personal situations.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy and the House that my Department's preparations for the change-over to Euro are progressing satisfactorily. All social welfare customers will automatically be paid in euro from 1 January next when their payments will be converted to euro and, if necessary, will be adjusted upwards to the nearest 10 cent amounts to the customer's advantage. Up to 31 December 2001, of course, payments will continue to issue in Irish pounds.</P>
      <P>My Department's public awareness campaign is being developed in close consultation with the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland and is paying particular attention to the needs of the hardest to reach categories, such as people with literacy difficulties. In that regard, my Department has met with a number of organisations representing special needs groups so as to take account of their views and further meetings with those organisations are planned over the coming months.</P>
      <P>The public awareness campaign which will be concentrated in the second half of this year, will utilise a range of media &ndash; print, radio and electronic &ndash; to get the euro message across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the events that have already taken place as part of the campaign are the following: an information leaflet entitled &ldquo;Social Welfare and the Euro&rdquo; was published in February 1999; letters issuing to long-term claimants, including pensioners, qualifying for their pension for the first time include the amount payable in both punt and euro; the mailshot which issued to all households last month included information on the euro; this publication is also available in both Braille and audio cassette on request; a new information leaflet entitled &ldquo;Social Welfare, The Euro and You&rdquo; which was launched last month is designed to inform our customers about the <Col N="593" /> change-over and to reassure the general public that no social welfare customer will be worse off as a result of the change-over process.</P>
    <P>Child benefit books showing the euro rates are in circulation since March this year and, from the renewal date in June 2001, all child benefit books include orders payable in euro from January 2002.</P>
    <P>The following elements of the public awareness campaign are planned for the second half of the year: Euro-inclusive payable order books for other schemes will be issuing at various stages throughout the year, for example, lone parents in August and pensioners in October &ndash; in addition, the back cover of all payable order books will display relevant Euro information; a euro-specific mailshot will issue to all social welfare customers, probably in early November, giving specific information on how the change-over affects their payments; my Department will establish a freephone Euro helpline to handle customer queries from mid-December this year and into the dual circulation period next year; seminars will be held in conjunction with the ECBI, commencing in Dundalk on 8 October, with a particular emphasis on promoting the euro among our customers in the low awareness groups; there will be ongoing euro advertising in the media; the ECBI's public information video is being updated and will be shown in various offices of the Department around the country; the ECBI is planning a second household mailshot in September and suitable social welfare material has been provided for inclusion in that publication.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that my Department's efforts, in conjunction with the ECBI and other agencies, will ensure a smooth transition into the new euro currency from 1 January next for all social welfare customers, including those with special needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of the establishment of a national standard for an adequate income for children is one which is currently being addressed by the social welfare benchmarking and indexation group which has been established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. This group, comprising representatives from the social partners and relevant Government Departments, is required under its terms of reference to examine the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing uprating or indexation of payments.</P>
      <P>The group is aiming to conclude its work by end-July 2001, with a view to presenting its final report shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>In the interim, the Deputy will be aware that it has been a priority of this Government to invest heavily in the child benefit scheme as a means of easing the financial burden of rearing children. The very significant increases in child benefit rates provided for in Budget 2001, which raised the level for the first two children by £25 per month and for the third and subsequent children by £30 per month, came into effect last month. Total expenditure on child benefit is now more than £900 million per year. Moreover, this Government is committed to providing for similar increases in the next two budgets, bringing investment in the scheme up to some £1.5 billion in a full year by 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allied to the effect that these increases will have on child poverty, falling unemployment is also having a significant impact. The most recent <Col N="595" /> data supplied by the Economic and Social Research Institute suggests that we are beginning to make inroads on the level of child poverty in Ireland. Consistent poverty for children fell from 16.9% in 1997 to 12% in 1998 and the ESRI points to the fall in unemployment as being the major factor here.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to providing an efficient service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.</P>
      <P>In determining entitlement to carer's allowance there are medical, means and residency conditions to be satisfied and there is inevitably a timelag involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable decisions to be made. In addition to the work my Department has to carry out, there is also an onus on applicants to furnish all necessary documentation. In a certain number of cases, delays are caused by the fact that the applicants have not provided the necessary information in support of their claim.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in recent years there have been a number of very significant improvements to the scheme. The number of persons who now receive a carer's allowance has increased from 10,330 at the end of December 1997 to 17,269 at the end of June 2001. The number of new claims now being received for carers allowance is double the intake over previous years. This large increase is reflected in the expenditure on carers allowance which was £36.5 million in 1997 and is projected to be £108.4 million this year representing an increase of almost 200 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any increase of this magnitude impacts to some degree on the capacity to process claims quickly and consequently there has been an overall increase in the number of carers allowance applications awaiting determination. However the majority of cases are at an advanced stage of processing. The average time for deciding an application for receipt of the allowance is currently in the region of 13 weeks. The substantial increase in number of new claims affects the time taken to process claims generally. Additional staff resources have recently been applied by my Department to deal with the extra work volumes for carers allowance. The level of resources <Col N="596" /> required and standard of claim processing is being kept under review to ensure that applicants receive a good quality service having regard to the conditions governing the scheme.</P>
    <P>It should be noted, however, that many applicants for carer's allowance are already in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed. Such payments will normally continue until entitlement to their carers allowance is determined. I should stress that any award of the allowance applies from the date on which the application is made to my Department. Any delay in processing of claims will therefore not result in any loss of entitlement to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has any particular case(s) in mind where a delay is being experienced, perhaps he would let my Department have the relevant details.</P>

      <P>Old age, non contributory, pension is a means tested payment.</P>
      <P>Under the relevant legislation, account must be taken of cash income, including pensions from other sources, in determining a person's means. When a pension is awarded, the pensioners are advised of the means assessment in each case and of their obligations to notify my Department of any subsequent change in their circumstances.</P>
      <P>Periodic reviews of entitlement are carried out from time to time to ensure that the correct entitlement is in payment. These reviews result in pensions being increased in circumstances where the pensioner's means have reduced &ndash; for example, when savings reduce or the net income from a business is reduced &ndash; and conversely, reductions in pension occur where the persons means are found to have increased.</P>
      <P>When carrying out reviews it is the practice to use the rate of exchange at the date of the last increase in foreign pensions or the rate of exchange in the subsequent quarters, whichever is most beneficial to the pensioner.</P>
      <P>In the case of pensioners who are also in receipt of British retirement pensions, it would be normal to expect that the British pension would be increased periodically. In cases where such pensioners do not notify my Department of changes in their means, reductions in their entitlement from my Department are likely to result from these reviews.</P>

      <P>Legislation provides for the back dating of claims for social welfare payments in certain circumstances. In the first instance, payment can be made in respect of a late claim, for a period of six months prior to the date of the claim, where good cause is shown for it being made late. I have also introduced important additional provisions for further payment of late claims where: the delay was due to incorrect information having been given by my Department; illness prevented a person from claiming earlier; for reasons of force majeure; where payment of the claim is necessary to prevent or relieve financial hardship.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for disability allowance on 4 March 1998 and was awarded the allowance with effect from that date. On 17 July 2000 he requested to have his claim backdated on the grounds that community welfare office and social welfare staff did not advise him of his potential entitlement at the time his incapacity commenced in January 1993. This request was considered by a deciding officer who made a revised decision.</P>
      <P>His claim was backdated by six months to 3 September 1997 under the relevant provisions in respect of late claims and arrears paid. On 8 August 2000 he appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office. An appeals officer decided on 4 January 2001 that he was not entitled to disability allowance prior to 3 September 1997 as he had failed to show that he fulfils the statutory condition for further backdating of his claim. An appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive and can only be revised in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>
      <P>During the period 25 February 1993 until the 3 September 1997, the person concerned was an adult dependent on his wife's invalidity pension claim. From October 1996, when the disability allowance scheme commenced to June 1997 limitation provisions applied to the disability allowance and invalidity pension schemes. Under these provisions the total amount payable to a couple was limited to a rate equivalent to that of personal rate plus qualified adult allowance.</P>
      <P>Similar limitation provisions also operated in the case of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme and accordingly the same situation would apply in respect of any further arrears for this allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently, even if the backdating of his <Col N="598" /> claim was allowed there would be no further arrears due to him for the period February 1993 to June 1997 in question because of this limitation.</P>

      <P>I have felt for some time that the original school meals scheme falls a long way short of what is required. Accordingly, I established an interdepartmental working group to review the scheme with a view to developing proposals for the future of school meals provision.</P>
      <P>As part of the review, my officials engaged in a wide ranging consultation exercise. This included meeting with and visiting some of those involved in new school meals initiatives at local level. The working group also organised a seminar on school meals in conjunction with the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
      <P>The overwhelming area of concern identified was the lack of State funding for projects at local level and I decided that an immediate response was required. Pending completion of the review, I set up a new scheme &ndash; the school meals community programme &ndash; in September of last year, with initial funding of £100,000 per annum. This funding is intended to meet the food costs of the voluntary and community based groups that are currently operating innovative school meals projects.</P>
      <P>It supports existing initiatives that are targeting areas of disadvantage or children with special needs. Unlike the statutory school meals scheme, it is available on a nation-wide basis to both primary and secondary schools. To date the funding has been allocated to 69 projects and benefits approximately 5,800 children. Inquiries have also been received from a number of schools that hope to set up projects in September 2001.</P>
      <P>As this approach is proving very successful, I have allocated £300,000 to the scheme this year. However, this represents just an initial response aimed at supporting communities and schools that are already active in this area. The working group that is reviewing school meal provision is developing proposals to address the full range of issues in this area so that children throughout the school system can benefit.</P>

      <P>The Galway survey, which was conducted in May-June 2000, focused on unemployed customers, within the operational catchment area of the Galway local office, and the employment opportunities available to them. The total sample selected for interview was 1,697, of whom 1,197 were long-term customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the main findings of the survey were low education levels, with 54% of the long-term customers compared to 25% of the short-term having only primary, or no formal education &ndash; literacy problems are a key issue. Some 34% of the long-term unemployed &ndash; 15% short-term &ndash; said they had a literacy difficulty; 11% of long-term customers have never worked. Some 75% of these have a literacy difficulty and 84% have only primary, or no formal education; just 23% of long-term and 32% of short-term customers felt they had experience to offer a prospective employer. The number who said they had a skill, or qualification were lower still. Access to transport was a difficulty with 36% of the long-term customers &ndash; 13% short-term &ndash; not having a car or suitable public transport. A total of 637 jobs <Col N="600" /> were identified. However, 54% of the long-term unemployed did not have the minimum education requirement for any of the jobs identified. Some 31% of vacancies required a third level education, but just 3% of the long-term and 10% of the short-term unemployed had achieved this level.</P>
    <P>The report on the findings of the survey was circulated widely at local level. In addition, its findings have been presented to and discussed with a range of agencies including, FÁS, Galway City Partnership, Galway Local Employment Service, Galway City VEC, and working groups within the Galway city and county development boards. Further consultation with these and other groups is planned for the coming months.</P>
    <P>As part of its employment support programme, my Department is engaged in identifying and referring people on the live register who require a range of targeted supports, including further training or education, to help them make the transition to work. Systematic referrals to FÁS also take place as part of the extended employment action plan in Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed and has placed their needs as a key issue on the agenda of every Department and public body.</P>
      <P>It is generally recognised that employment and training offer important routes for people with disabilities to achieve economic and social independence. That is why the Government has arranged for the transfer of responsibility for employment and vocational training of people with disabilities from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Employment and vocational training policies for people with disabilities are now dealt with as part of general labour market policy and have, as a priority, clear progression routes from sheltered work, supported work and sheltered employment to employment options in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>For its own part, my Department has been endeavouring to ensure that the social welfare system does not act as a disincentive to people with disabilities in taking up available employment and training opportunities. The system is therefore, being adapted from one of passive support to a position of facilitating people with disabilities who wish to take up available employment and training opportunities. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in relation to the supports available to people with disabilities to encourage them to become more self-reliant. One of these measures is the extension of the back-to-work allowance to claimants of disability allowance and blind person's pension. Access to this scheme was further extended to recipients of invalidity pension and unemployability supplement from September 2000. In addition, the back-to-education allowance has also been extended to all of the above categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures complement the existing employment supports, which were previously available through the NRB and are now available through FÁS. These are of particular importance to people with disabilities in gaining access to the open labour market. However, it is accepted that <Col N="602" /> many people with disabilities are not in a position to engage in such employment. Additional measures are, therefore, required to facilitate people with disabilities so that they can engage in other forms of employment and training, such as sheltered or rehabilitative employment. In this regard, a special earnings disregard applies in the case of people with disabilities in receipt of disability allowance and blind person's pension who are engaged in rehabilitative employment. This earnings disregard was increased by 50% from £50 to £75 a week from April 2000. In addition, the enhanced £75 rehabilitative earnings disregard was extended to those in self-employment.</P>
    <P>Despite the many social welfare improvements for people with disabilities in recent years, it is recognised that more needs to be done. In particular, we need to put in place preventive strategies to stop people becoming isolated. For example, one in five of those who claim disability allowance from my Department are 20 years of age or under. One quarter are aged 25 or less. We owe it to these young people to make sure that they have a chance to participate fully in the education and employment opportunities which are available.</P>
    <P>That is why I have asked my Department and FÁS to work together to ensure that young people claiming disability allowance are given the opportunity, on a voluntary basis, to participate in education, training and work opportunities.</P>
    <P>As the intention is to encourage and facilitate young people with disabilities to participate in these opportunities where their physical condition and social circumstances so warrant, I do not consider that the setting of targets for reducing the number of people under 20 years on disability allowance would be helpful in this regard.</P>

      <P>According to the latest CSO projections, there are currently an estimated 427,600 persons in the State aged 65 years of age or over. An estimated 35% of this group are in receipt of an old age, contributory, or retirement pension in their own right. In addition an estimated 18% are in receipt of another contributory payment, for example, widow or widowers or invalidity pension in their own right giving an overall 53%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining 47% comprises broadly those in receipt of old age, non contributory, pension &ndash; 21% &ndash; other non contributory payments &ndash; 5% &ndash; people in respect of whom a qualified adult <Col N="603" /> allowance is being paid &ndash; 7% &ndash; and those not in receipt of any social welfare payment &ndash; 14%. It should be noted that these figures are best estimates of the position.</P>
    <P>CSO population statistics project that there will be 503,900 people aged 65 or over in 2011. While it is difficult to be precise about the likely numbers who will receive contributory-based payments, the fact that we now have a very comprehensive social insurance system and the improved workforce participation, particularly among women, means that progressively more people will qualify in their own right. This trend is already evident in claims for old age pensions. In 1989 just under 50% of new awards received a contributory based pension and this has risen to over 62%. It is expected that this trend will continue in the future. Applying the projections of the Actuarial Review of Social Welfare Pensions, published in 1997, would suggest that 80% of the projected total population aged 65 or over will be in receipt of a contributory pension by 2011.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs. A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households and £8 per week is paid in smokeless zones.</P>
      <P>I have, in fact, already extended the duration of the scheme. Up to now, the scheme ran for 26 weeks but I extended it for two weeks in April 2001. In addition, the start of the next fuel season is being brought forward by one week to the beginning of October and the scheme will run for a period of 29 weeks.</P>
      <P>The national and smokeless fuel schemes were reviewed in 1998 as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review group took the view that improvements in the national fuel scheme cannot be looked at in isolation from the improvements in the primary weekly payment rates.</P>
      <P>The group concluded that the present rates of payment should remain unchanged if improvements in primary payment rates fully compensated recipients for all price inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
      <P>In that regard, the increases in primary payments of £8 to £10 per week that I brought into effect in April of this year are the largest ever implemented. They give a substantial real increase after fully compensating for inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> Giving people a real increase in their primary payment for 52 weeks of the year is a more expensive option than increasing the fuel allowance payment rate for part of the year. However, I believe it is the correct approach to take as it gives people greater flexibility in meeting their needs.</P>
    <P>In the light of these improvements I have no further plans for the scheme at this time. I would also point out that fuel allowances are not the sole mechanism through which assistance is provided to people with heating needs.</P>
    <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. Exceptional needs payments are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels in respect of various classes of persons, e.g. single persons, couples, lone parents with one child, etc., as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly by the boards to take account of fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards, at the initiative of the health <Col N="605" /> boards, in the light of their experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of rent and mortgage interest supplement in any particular year is calculated by taking account of trends relating to the number of recipients relying on the supplements and the increases in the maximum rent levels as advised and implemented by the various health boards.</P>
    <P>With regard to future arrangements, the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance to be operated by the local authorities, as the Deputy may be aware. One of the objectives of the new scheme will be to ensure that a full range of housing options is available to people with long-term housing needs. The priority is to provide housing solutions rather than social welfare solutions to meet the housing needs of people on low incomes. In that regard, I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will be bringing detailed proposals to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>The initiation of this process, which is being jointly undertaken by my Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Combat Poverty Agency, took place in 2000 when a number of regional seminars to extend the national anti-poverty strategy analysis to local level were held. Of particular note is the local government learning network, launched last October, which is a joint initiative between these organisations to support the development of a strong anti-poverty focus within local government. The network features strong representation from social inclusion units, other local authority officials, and councillors. The network has met twice this year and is supported by a local government advisory committee, which has a specific mandate to provide a channel for local authority experience to feed into central Government policy.</P>

      <P>The live register is published each month by the Central Statistics Office on the basis of returns made by local offices of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that the live register is not designed to measure unemployment. This is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey. The live register is simply an administrative record of persons in receipt of or claiming unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or credited contributions in respect of unemploy<Col N="608" /> ment. It includes, for example, part-time workers and seasonal and casual workers who are receiving unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>The CSO also publishes as part of the live register a seasonally adjusted figure each month. The adjusted figure is based on factors determined by the CSO. These factors are updated twice a year in January and July, based on the underlying trends in the previous two years.</P>
    <P>The last adjustment made to these factors took place in January 2001, based on the trends in 1999 and 2000. The next adjustment will be made in July 2001, based on the trends from June 1999 to June 2001.</P>
    <P>Since March 2001, the seasonally adjusted figure has increased by 300 in March, 1,700 in April, and 2,100 in May. The increases since March reflect in part the direct impact of foot and mouth related cases as well as related indirect impacts in the tourism and leisure sectors.</P>
    <P>However, comparing month on month in 2000 and 2001, the yearly drop in the seasonally adjusted figures reads as follows:</P>

    <P>Since June 1997, the seasonally adjusted figure has dropped by 113,600 from 255,200 to 141,600 or by 45%.</P>
    <P>While the seasonally adjusted figure has shown an increase in the last three months, overall the live register figures continue to decline. There has been a fall of almost 8,000 in the live register figure since the start of the current year. This is mainly due to the current buoyant economy and better job opportunities, the various employment support services, including the employment action plan and the control measures in place in my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as other Departments and agencies, is committed to ensuring that all those on the live register are facilitated to return quickly to employment, further training or education and we will continue to promote a variety of responses, including fiscal, training and activation to assist them.</P>

      <P>Work is well in hand in the Department to effect a smooth changeover to <Col N="609" /> the euro on 1 January 2002. Customers receiving payments by order books will have books spanning the changeover period well in advance of the change. Euro orders for pay days in January 2002 onwards are already contained in the main annual renewal of child benefit books which issued last month. Euro orders will also be included in payment books to issue to one parent families and widows pensioners in August next and to other categories of pensioners in October.</P>
      <P>Customers receiving their payments by cheque, by direct credit to bank and other accounts or on presenting their social services card at their local post office will be paid in euro on their first pay day in 2002. Payments to customers up to and including 31 December 2001 will, of course, continue to issue in Irish pounds.</P>
      <P>Preparations for the euro changeover should not be confused with issues that relate to the alignment of the tax and calendar years from 1 January next. Consequent on that decision the Government has also decided that, next year, social welfare increases will take effect from the beginning of January. Budget 2002, which will be announced on 5 December 2001, will provide for these increases.</P>
      <P>Every effort will be made to ensure that increases are paid by or close to the beginning of January. In some cases, because of the timescales involved in the production of certain payments, it will not be possible for increases to be paid in all cases in January. This has nothing to do with the euro changeover but is solely due to timing considerations. In cases, however, where there is delay in implementing the increase, all arrears due will be paid at the latest by mid-February 2002 effective from the beginning of January. I should mention also that in the current year the effective payment date for the budget increases was brought forward substantially to April. This meant that for the first time, social welfare increases came into effect at the same time as the changes in the income tax provisions announced in the annual budget. The position in 2002 will be even more significantly improved with the increases effective from January, which is a full three months earlier than this year.</P>

      <P>The report, &ldquo;Employability and its Relevance for Management of the Live Register&rdquo;, which was commissioned by my Department was published by the ESRI on 17 <Col N="610" /> May last. The report is a detailed and wide-ranging treatment of the concept of employability and the issues inherent in addressing the problem.</P>
      <P>The report complements and informs my Department's ongoing efforts to assist those on the live register to make the transition to work and training. It identifies a number of different dimensions of employability or factors that reduce a person's employability. These include issues such as age, gender, education, previous work experience, location and transport.</P>
      <P>The report highlights issues that transcend a variety of sectors, departments and agencies. It is now being considered in detail and its implications and recommendations assessed. Consultation will take place with appropriate Departments, relevant agencies and the social partners. In particular we will be looking at ways to enhance and further the development of the close working relationship we enjoy with FÁS in the context of the employment action plan.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently engaged as part of its employment support programme in identifying and assisting people on the live register who require a range of targeted supports to help them make the transition to work or further training or education. The type of service which my Department's jobs facilitators offer to the long-term unemployed is broadly in line with the recommendations in the ESRI report.</P>

      <P>The position as outlined in my reply to a similar question on 13 June 2000 is unchanged and the Government has no plans to change the procedures for the granting of patents of precedence. On that occasion I indicated that since the establishment of the State, the Government has granted patents of precedence to barristers leading to the call to the Senior Bar by the Chief Justice. Historically, at common law, the grant of silk was an exercise of the Royal prerogative. The transfer of functions which had previously been dependent on the Royal prerogative, to the Executive Council of Saorstát Éireann was clarified by section 2 of the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937. The function is now exercised by the Government as successor to the Executive Council and is no longer dependent on the Royal prerogative.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that I have received representations from schools, including the Bray Project national school and from parents expressing concern regarding the inadequate funding of schools for secretarial and other services previously undertaken by participants on the community employment programme, CE.</P>
      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF, and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners certain essential services currently undertaken by participants on CE will be mainstreamed. This process involves the transfer of CE funding for specific services to other Departments with functional responsibility for the services in question. Services in the schools sector are being prioritised at present in this regard.</P>
      <P>Mainstreaming will take place on a phased basis having regard to the suitability for mainstreaming of the service being provided, and with due regard to an individual's participation entitlements on CE. Mainstreaming should enhance the services being provided and provide valuable employment opportunities. I intend to initiate the mainstreaming process by transferring CE funding freed up by the reduction in CE positions in schools to the Department of Education and Science in time for the new school year beginning in September next. The transfer of CE moneys to the Department of Education and Science will enable that Department to put in place an equitable system of funding for such services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended under the mainstreaming process that all schools, including those who have never benefited from CE funding, will receive additional funding. During a transition period some schools will receive the additional funding from the Department of Education and Science while still benefiting from the services of CE participants, as CE incumbents who opt to serve out their contracts will be facilitated in doing so. However, it should be noted that, as part of the mainstreaming process, CE participants will not be replaced in schools when their term has finished. Schools services in future will be solely the <Col N="612" /> responsibility of the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of the 35 city and county enterprise boards have recently reported to us, some potential difficulties in relation to their 2001 cash allocations.</P>
      <P>Having examined the matter in our mid-year review, I have arranged that an extra £1 million &ndash; 1.269 million &ndash; be provided immediately for the capital expenditure of the boards. This equates to an increase of 6% of the capital expenditure for the boards for 2001. Capital expenditure covers measure 1 &ndash; financial intervention &ndash; capital, employment and feasibility study grants; and measure 2 &ndash; entrepreneurial and capability development &ndash; advice, training mentoring, etc.</P>
      <P>Our officials are also taking other measures to increase the flexibility in managing the funds already allocated.</P>
      <P>The matter will be kept under review by our officials, in consultation with the 35 boards and appropriate action taken to ensure that the boards are in a position to discharge fully their work, which is important for the economic well-being of the State.</P>
      <P>Repayable grants offer, in the longer term, an opportunity for enterprise boards, to make available additional funding for measure 1 grants. We will keep the matter under review, during the second half of the year.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that there are currently 300,000 women working in the home. Government policy has sought a number of ways to make it attractive for women to take up or return to paid work. Since 1997 some 200,000 additional women have taken up jobs.</P>
      <P>A major area where support is required is in the area of child care. The Government is committed under the national development plan to meeting the diverse needs of parents and children, including key target groups, through supporting the development of childcare services that are accessible and of high quality. In October 2000, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced details of a new Government package worth £40 million, over and above the £250 million allocated under the national development plan, to expand the number of child care places available throughout the country. In the first six months of 2001, the Government allocated funding for 13,843 child care places of which 5,883 are new.</P>
      <P>In order to support mothers wishing to return to work who need to make provision for child care in order to avail of FÁS training, £3.9 million pounds has been set aside this year in order to pay a contribution towards child care costs of £50 per week per child. FÁS will be evaluating this initiative at the end of the current year to ensure that it is meeting the needs of primary child carers who wish to take up training opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS provides a wide range of programmes at <Col N="614" /> local level to facilitate women to return to the workplace. In addition to its current provision which includes approximately 1,500 places on its return to work programme, women wishing to return to work take up training in a wide range of training programmes many of which are provided at community level in association with locally-based community groups. In addition, women returning to work can avail of FÁS guidance and advisory services.</P>
    <P>In total, females accounted for 54% of total training excluding apprentices and total employment programmes throughput in 2000 which amounted to a total number of 44,266 places.</P>

      <Quest> if her attention has been drawn to the fact that a British based company (details supplied) has gone into voluntary liquidation; if her attention has further been drawn to the fact that this has the potential to cause severe difficulty for many Irish companies; if she will put some protective mechanism in place for these companies; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste and I have been following closely developments in relation to Independent Insurance Company Limited, IICL, a UK insurer which went into voluntary liquidation on 18 June, with particular focus on the immediate implications for Irish policyholders and claimants. We are also concerned at the broader implications for the effective operation of the European Single Market in insurance. Contact is being maintained with the UK authorities and with the EU Commission, as well as with the provisional liquidators, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Irish Insurance Federation and the Irish Brokers Association.</P>
      <P>Under the rules of the European Single Market, responsibility for financial supervision of the company's operations throughout the European Economic Area, EEA, lies with the UK authorities. The main objective of the EU system of financial supervision of insurance companies is to protect policyholders while giving them access to insurance cover from supervised companies in all EEA member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment of policyholders as creditors of a failed insurer is determined by the laws of the &ldquo;home&rdquo; member state &ndash; in this case, the United Kingdom. UK insolvency law treats all policy<Col N="617" /> holders as unsecured creditors. It will not be clear for some time the extent to which the liquidators of IICL will be able to meet claims from the creditors of IICL, including policyholders. It appears likely that claims will not be met in full.</P>
    <P>The UK Policyholder Protection Act provides, subject to certain limitations, that compensation be paid to individual policyholders in the event of a company failure. Corporate policyholders are compensated only in respect of compulsory insurance. Our officials are seeking to clarify whether any policies issued to Irish policyholders will meet the qualifying criteria for protection.</P>

      <Quest> if cutbacks are being enforced by her Department on community employment and FÁS community schemes; her views on whether all those over 50 years of age should be allowed to remain on such schemes until retirement rather than return to social welfare; her further views on whether these schemes have been of benefit to the improvement of living conditions of the elderly and disabled and for the improvement of the environment; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the community employment programme, CE, is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into employment in the open labour market. Through CE, participants are provided with valuable opportunities for development and training, and communities are provided with the resources necessary to provide services locally and-or develop their local area. Opportunities, in an increasingly positive labour market environment, for CE participants who have completed their term on the programme to obtain permanent employment are influenced by location, education and the skill level of the participants.</P>
      <P>There are currently in the region of 33,500 participants on CE, of whom 10,520 are over 50 years of age. Following a restructuring of the programme in 1999 participation levels are gradually being reduced to 28,000 by the end of 2003. The mainstreaming of certain essential services currently undertaken by CE participants, which will provide new employment opportunities for CE participants and other long-term unemployed persons, will further reduce the numbers employed on the programme. The maximum duration on CE for all participants is three years with the exception of offshore island inhabitants and participants on drugs taskforce projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is finalising proposals for a high supports process, as required under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which will <Col N="618" /> enhance the range of options available for job seekers with employment barriers, including older persons on CE who have limited employment opportunities in the open labour market. Further consultations with the social partners on the high supports process are due to take place shortly and I would hope that this process can be put in place at an early date.</P>
    <P>My Department is also considering with FÁS the issue of older persons, workers in rural areas and others who have previously participated on CE, and who are having difficulty progressing to open employment. This issue will be also considered in the context of developing policy for the high supports process, and in the light of the implications of both elements for the future operation of CE following the mainstreaming of essential services.</P>

      <P>Procedures for the designation and protection of special areas of conservation, &ndash; SACs &ndash; are prescribed by the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 94 of 1997), made by my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for the protection of SACs, including marine areas, require relevant Ministers to ensure that an appropriate assessment is carried out of the implications of any operation or activity likely to have a significant effect on an SAC. Except for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, any such operation or activity may be undertaken or authorised only if the Minister concerned has ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the SAC in question.</P>
      <P>The foregoing requirements apply in respect of a number of enactments for which I am responsible, including the Foreshore Acts, the Fisheries Acts, the Dumping at Sea Act, 1996, and enactments relating to minerals, oil and gas. Accordingly the administration of those Acts by my Department is informed by the need to ensure the protection of SACs. Inspections are undertaken, as necessary, in connection with proposed operations or activities, as an integral part of considering the proposals.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in both jurisdictions are working together on the preparation of the draft legislation and I expect that the Bill will be ready for publication towards the end of this year.</P>
      <P>As part of the legislation preparation process the two Departments undertook a public consultation process in both the Foyle and Carlingford areas last year. All stakeholders were invited to participate and the outcome of this has informed the drafting of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Under the British Irish Agreement Act, 1999 the Foyle Carlingford Irish Lights Commission, FCILC, is responsible for the development of fisheries, aquaculture and marine tourism in the Foyle and Carlingford areas. The preparation and co-ordination of any strategic plans in relation to these matters are the direct responsibility of the FCILC. The Act also provides that the FCILC will prepare a strategic plan for marine tourism, including the promotion and marketing of the Foyle and Carlingford areas and co-ordination of the delivery of the development strategy. The FCILC is currently undertaking preliminary work in relation to the perpetration of such a plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North-South Ministerial Council have approved the FCILC's proposal to establish an advisory forum representative of the key stake<Col N="620" /> holders in each area. The advisory forum, which will be in place shortly, will ensure that there is full consultation at local level on future strategies and developments in the Foyle and Carlingford areas.</P>

      <P>While I thank the Deputy for his suggestion, decisions relating to the work schedule for completion of the famine vessel, the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>, remain with the board of the Jeanie Johnston Company (Ireland) Limited, the promoters of the project. I understand that the company has already put in train the necessary arrangements to ensure that the problems with the technical systems, which led to the latest delay in completing the vessel, are rectified as quickly as possible. I am advised by the deputy chief surveyor from the Marine Survey Office of my Department, who visited the ship recently, that this work can readily be undertaken in Fenit, County Kerry, where the vessel remains at present, and should be finished in a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, my Department will convene a meeting of the relevant stakeholders to consider the latest developments in relation to this project and to begin a constructive review of the vessel's future, both in the short and long-term.</P>

      <P>The Irish Aviation Authority was established with effect from 1 January 1994 pursuant to the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, to exercise powers and functions in relation to safety of air navigation services and regulation of safety at airports in the State. When consulted about proposed developments in the red zones, the IAA advises the planning authorities of any conflict with international aviation safety requirements, and also draws their attention to increased public safety risks in those areas.</P>
      <P>The Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998, requires Aer Rianta to take all proper measures for the safety, security, management, control, regulation, operation, marketing and development of its airports. In discharge of that statutory duty, it is a matter for Aer Rianta to decide what representations, if any, it should make to the relevant planning authorities in respect of proposed developments within or in proximity to the State airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning authorities have the normal statutory responsibility to regulate development <Col N="622" /> in their areas. In doing this, they take account of a wide variety of concerns, including public safety.</P>
    <P>The red zones at airports were developed in the 1960s to indicate to the local authorities the areas in which development may need to be restricted, in the interests of aviation safety specifically, and public safety generally. The red zones have traditionally had two functions, namely the aviation safety function of avoiding developments which, potentially, because of their height, may interfere with the safe take-off and landing of aircraft, but also avoiding developments which, because of their location, would add to public safety risks, that is, the risk to people on the ground.</P>
    <P>This Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment and Local Government, has commissioned consultants to make recommendations for public safety zones in the vicinity of Dublin Airport. The recommendations of ERM will specifically deal with the risk to people on the ground.</P>
    <P>This work, when completed, will clarify that the primary agency responsible for aviation safety assessments will continue to be the Irish Aviation Authority, whereas the primary agency in assessing public safety risks will be the relevant planning authority itself. In any event, the planning authorities in accordance with their own statutory obligations, and ultimately, An Bord Pleanála, will continue to decide whether specific development proposals in the vicinity of airports receive planning permission.</P>
    <P>When the study is completed, the Department of the Environment and Local Government will issue planning guidelines in accordance with the Planning Acts to the local authorities to assist them in their consideration of the public safety aspects of planning applications in the vicinity of airports. It is my understanding that no further statutory or legislative measures are necessary.</P>
    <P>I am informed by Aer Rianta that there are a total of 11 locations at Dublin Airport upon which some or all of the buildings which are used for social, operational, commercial and sporting use lie within the red safety areas of the approaches to existing and future runways. They are on land now owned by Aer Rianta and which was transferred from the Minister to Aer Rianta on 1 January 1999. The locations of these premises facilitate a limitation as to their use and/or modification, and/or removal if necessary. Aer Rianta or the Fingal planning authority will be in a position to provide the Deputy with any further information he may require in relation to this.</P>
    <P>As regards premises that lie outside the airport boundary but within the red zones and also in relation to restrictions on public gatherings, the Deputy may wish to contact Fingal Planning Authority.</P>

      <P>Recent reports suggest a high Internet usage in Ireland. The Global eCommerce Report 2001, produced by British research from TNS Interactive shows Ireland has the fourth highest proportion of internet users among the 18 European countries surveyed &ndash; at 39% of all over-15s. Earlier last week, Nielsen-NetRatings figures for Ireland showed that the areas of finance, news and travel are driving the overall growth in internet usage. Nielsen figures show a 74% growth in Irish internet usage over the last year.</P>
      <P>The provision of telecommunications services including internet services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Director of Telecommunications Regulation. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.</P>
      <P>The communications regulation Bill, which is currently being drafted, aims to replace the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation with a commission for communications regulation, and also seeks to broaden the current scope of telecommunications regulatory powers in the light of the emerging new EU regulatory framework.</P>
      <P>I have also, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly by bringing broadband connectivity to regional and rural areas.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, 26 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Some 13 projects which rolled-out broadband nation-wide were supported and are now nearing completion.</P>
      <P>The figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, to 200 million. Two-thirds of this allocation will be spent in the BMW region. A first call for proposals was run last year and on foot of submissions received I signed nine contracts at the beginning of the year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. Information is available at www.ndpcomms.gov.ie.</P>
      <P>Further calls for proposals for investment in telecommunications infrastructure will issue in 2001.</P>

      <P>The consultation paper entitled, A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport, was published by the Government in September 2000. It sets out a number of proposals on the restructuring of the CIE companies. These proposals are currently the subject of consultation with the Public Transport Partnership Forum which was established under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>Before responding to the Government's consultation paper, the forum has commissioned an independent consultant to carry out a comparative evaluation of the provision, regulation and integration of public transport in nine selected cities throughout the world. I understand this consultancy is nearing completion. I will await the forum's response before finalising my proposals for Government in this area.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, my Department is continuing to carry out background work on institutional reform issues. Following consultation with the forum, my Department is currently considering tenders from consultants to carry out a research study into the financial and other implications of the restructuring of the CIE group of companies.</P>

This paper set out the Government's proposals for institutional and regulatory reform of the public transport system, including the removal of the geographic restriction on Bus Éireann's area of operations.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann is currently excluded from providing services where Bus Átha Cliath do so by the Transport (Re-organisation of Córas Iompar Éireann) Act, 1986. Amending legislation will be necessary to allow Bus Éireann to provide services in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Any legislation needed to introduce the proposals in the framework document will be prepared by my Department when I have considered all responses to the consultation, including that of Public Transport Partnership Forum which I expect to receive in early autumn.</P>

      <P>The consultation paper, A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport was published in September 2000. This paper set out the Government's proposals for institutional and regulatory reform of the public transport system, including the introduction of competition. These proposals are currently subject to public consultation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the greater Dublin area bus market, the paper proposes the introduction of competition through a franchising system for routes or groups of routes. Under this system private operators would compete for the right to provide services on routes, usually on an exclusive basis.</P>
      <P>In the meantime my Department is working within the existing regulatory regime to increase private participation in the expansion of bus services in the greater Dublin area.  </P>
      <P>New guidelines for the consideration of licence applications were issued in December 2000 and a licensing round was launched. Following consideration of the applications 21 offers of licences were made in May 2001. Of these 21 offers, nine have been accepted; three have been refused; and a review has been requested on the remaining nine offers. WP leading adjustment</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Railway Safety Programme 1999-2003 was agreed by Government in March 1999. It provides for an investment totalling £430.6 million over the five years of the programme, comprising £379.4 million for infrastructural safety works and £51.2 million for improvements to the safety management systems of Iarnród Éireann. The investment on infrastructural works includes £32.2 million for the renewal of some 110 bridges and the re-painting of 500 bridges across the network over the life of the programme.</P>
      <P>The works that are being carried out under the safety programme are prioritised by Iarnród Éireann, based on the recommendations of independent consultations who carried out a review of railway safety in 1998 and on the company's engineering expertise and judgment.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Ennis to Galway railway line, the safety programme includes provision for the upgrading or painting of some bridges, other ancillary works such as fencing and level crossings and, in relation to the section of this line from Athenry to Galway, the renewal of all of the track with the exception of some station track work.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am advised by Iarnród Éireann that necessary normal maintenance on the Ennis to Galway line is carried out as required.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the North-Eastern Health Board has agreed to purchase the former military barracks and establish a project which will provide for 45 permanent appointments and that a further sum in excess of £1 million will be invested in the provision of the necessary facilities.

    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> These investments by the State clearly demonstrates its commitment to the Castleblayney area. I am confident that when the project is complete it will be a welcome boost to the local community both financially and recreationally.</P>

      <P>Following discussions between my Department and the farming bodies the key operational aspects of the on-farm market valuation scheme have been phased in since early February.</P>
      <P>The three categories of breakdown situations where the choice of live valuation or the current reactor grant arrangements have been offered to herdowners are: Depopulations agreed on or after 1 January 2001; test breakdown on or after 1 January 2001 involving pedigree reactors; and test breakdown on or after 1 January 2001 involving 12 or more reactors.</P>
      <P>I have now decided to extend the phasing in arrangements to allow herdowners with six or more reactors on a test occurring on or after 1 July to be offered the option of live valuation. The position will continually be monitored over the coming months with a view to further extending these arrangements.</P>

      <P>Classification of beef carcasses is carried out by officials of my Department in accordance with a standard EU system, using criteria laid down in the Council and Commission regulations. Classification is based on a visual examination of the dressed carcass and is a subjective examination of the carcass characteristics.</P>
      <P>To ensure uniformity in the interpretation and application of classification standards, an EU control committee made up of member state and Commission experts visit each member state at approximate three to four yearly intervals. The most recent visit to Ireland was in late 1997 when the operation of the beef carcass classification scheme was found to be very satisfactory. In addition, other visits are made by Commission experts to check compliance with related schemes. One such visit was made to Ireland this spring and the standard of operation of the beef carcass classification scheme was again commended.  </P>
      <P>The Commission regulations also require each member state to carry out unannounced checks at each slaughter plant at approximate six weekly intervals. In Ireland's case these checks are carried out by management staff and the results are reported annually to the Commission. Apart from their audit function, these visits also provide strong technical back-up to the classification staff operating locally.</P>
      <P>The appeals mechanism is a further safeguard that exists within the scheme. Under the mechanism a producer who is not satisfied with the decision of the classification officer may lodge an appeal while the carcass is still intact in the slaughter plant. The regulations allow for a re-assessment of the carcass to take place and an amendment of the original decision, where an error has been made.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that beef carcass classification is carried out here in a fair and balanced manner.</P>

Applications for registration and approval of dealers and dealers' premises under the aforementioned S.I. must be submitted by 24 July 2001. As it will take some time to effect the registration and approval process an order is being made, to extend until 31 October, the period specified under Regulation 6 (9) of S.I. No. 79 during which dealers already registered with DVOs may continue to operate.</P>
      <P>In addition, it is possible that not all dealers' premises will comply fully with the legislative requirements at the outset. In the circumstances DVOs have been instructed that they may register the dealer and allow up to six months to reach compliance with the new regulations by attaching conditions to the grant of approval depending on the extent of additional works necessary. Each case will be decided on its merits taking into account the standard of existing facilities and the dealer's past record in compliance with regulatory requirements.</P>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the person referred to in the question made application on 4 April for exemption from VRT, under the transfer of residence provisions, in respect of the registration in the State of his UK registered vehicle.</P>
      <P>On 26 June the Revenue Commissioners wrote to the applicant advising him that his application was refused on the grounds that he did not have use and possession of the vehicle outside the State for the required six month period prior to his transfer to Ireland. The applicant was furnished with information concerning eligibility for tax relief on transfer of residence and was also advised of the appeal procedures involved where an application for such relief was refused. I further understand that no such appeal has been made to date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: their disability must impede their use of public transport; they must hold a driving license; they must be physically and mentally capable of driving; and the motorised transport must be a necessity in <Col N="639" /> order for the person to obtain/retain employment or the person must have a transport requirement because of very isolated circumstances.</P>
    <P>Applications may also be considered in cases where persons with severe disabilities are incapable of managing the controls of a car or where, on medical opinion, it is inadvisable for them to drive and therefore they must be driven to and from their place of employment. In such cases the car must be purchased by the person with a disability and the name of the person who will drive this person to and from his/her place of employment must be notified to the relevant health board.</P>

      <P>My Department has indicated funding levels to the North-Western Health Board under the national development plan for the period 2001 to 2006. The board has been asked to formulate a plan in line with the funding levels indicated to it and to prioritise projects on this basis for future planning purposes.</P>
      <P>The funding available each year, over the life of the NDP, to health boards will depend on a number of factors including adjustments in respect of various issues such as inflation, changing service priorities, technological developments, new clinical practices, progress on the delivery of specific projects and market capacity in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>Health board plans are expected to evolve over the period of the NDP in line with prevailing service, financial and operational circumstances. Therefore, it is not possible at this stage to project the progress on all individual projects proposed under the NDP or indeed to project the quantum of outcomes resulting from the plans of the boards.</P>
      <P>The prioritisation and delivery of individual projects within the NDP is the primary responsibility of the North-Western Health Board. I have asked its chief executive officer to provide the Deputy with any specific information he may require.</P>

    </table>
    <P>Details of the plans which the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards have for this population group are as follows: </P>
    <P>Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; 279 persons</P>
    <P>Some 263 persons with an intellectual disability are currently accommodated in St. Joseph's Intellectual Disability Service on the St. Ita's campus. St. Joseph's Intellectual Disability Service provides residential care in dedicated accommodation on the campus and is separate from the mental health service.</P>
    <P>As at the end of June, 12 residents had moved to purpose built accommodation in Oldtown, County Meath with a further 18 due to move over the coming months. Planning is at an advanced stage for similar bungalow complexes on the hospital campus to accommodate a further 60 residents. The development plans for the Northern Area Health Board for the next five years provide for the transfer of the remaining residents in St. Joseph's services to more appropriate accommodation, which will include both refurbished and purpose built accommodation.</P>
    <P>Two of the remaining 16 persons are appropriately placed within the mental health services and the needs of the 14 others will be reviewed as part of the ongoing development of the services.</P>
    <P>Midland Health Board &ndash; 26 persons</P>
    <P>A project team has been established to plan and implement a programme to provide alternative placements for those accommodated in St. Fintan's and St. Loman's, in addition to the <Col N="642" /> de-designated units in St. Peter's, Castlepollard, Alvernia Centre and Lough Sheever. It also wishes to enhance the overall level of services available to these centres. Four properties have been purchased to date. A project manager is being appointed to oversee the implementation of this programme.</P>
    <P>Mid-Western Health Board &ndash; 62 persons</P>
    <P>As at the end of June, 23 residents have been transferred from St. Joseph's Hospital, Limerick to the Daughters of Charity service, Lisnagry, with a further 13 residents due to move this month. A new unit has been built for 25 persons accommodated in Our Lady's, Ennis. Plans are currently being prepared for the remaining 24 persons in St. Joseph's, Limerick.</P>
    <P>North-Eastern Health Board &ndash; 19 persons</P>
    <P>The board is in the process of negotiating with St. John of Gods the relocating of the small number of persons remaining in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ardee and it expects the move to take place by the end of September or the beginning of October. Six persons will transfer to a community group home in July. Discussions are taking place with St. Mary's, Drumcar concerning alternative placements for a further four persons.</P>
    <P>North-Western Health Board &ndash; 15 persons</P>
    <P>The remaining 15 persons resident in St. Conal's Hospital did not want to move when others were given alternative accommodation some years ago. All are now elderly and will be moved later this year to appropriate placements within the geriatric services.</P>
    <P>South-Eastern Health Board &ndash; 116 persons</P>
    <P>21 persons will be moving from St. Canice's Hospital, Kilkenny to new purpose built accommodation later this year. A similar facility for a further 21 persons from Kelvin Grove, Carlow is at an advanced stage of planning. A premises to accommodate eight persons from St. Senan's Hospital, Enniscorthy has been identified and discussions are taking place with the board concerning plans for the remaining clients in this hospital. Funding has also been provided for alternative day facilities for persons accommodated in St. Luke's Hospital, Clonmel.</P>
    <P>Southern Health Board &ndash; 33 persons</P>
    <P>29 of the 45 persons with an intellectual disability who were accommodated in St. Finan's Hospital, Killarney have moved to new purpose built facilities. It was intended that the remaining 16 persons would transfer to community based services with Kerry Parents and Friends Association. It now appears that only six persons will move to the community, with the remaining persons requiring a psychogeriatric service. Funding has been allocated to enable this process to commence. The majority of the remaining 17 persons currently accommodated within the other psychiatric facilities <Col N="643" /> within the board's services require a psychogeriatric service.</P>
    <P>Western Health Board &ndash; 60 persons</P>
    <P>28 persons will be transferred from St. Brigid's, Ballinasloe this year to community based facilities and to a purpose built facility for 12 persons. Between ten to 12 persons from St. Mary's Hospital will be transferred to Áras Attracta, Swinford. Discussions will take place over the coming months with the board in respect of their plans for the remaining 20 persons.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, much progress has been made in recent years in meeting the needs of this population group. I assure her that this Government is committed to an ongoing programme of investment in this area.</P>

In 2001 a further £15.75 million has been allocated to further enhance the level of residential services available around the country.

    <P>*As was the case in previous years, the actual number of places made available in 2001 will be confirmed towards the end of the year when account can be taken of emergency placements made during the year.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>It should be noted that, in addition to the provision of new residential places, there has also been a significant level of enhanced service provision for persons who were already in receipt of some level of residential care. This would include, for example, extending five day placements to seven days.</P>
    <P>In April 1999 information from the National Intellectual Disability Database indicated that, in the period 2000 to 2004, 1,677 new residential places were required to meet the identified needs for this service. My Department is reviewing the position in relation to the implementation of the overall development programme for these ser<Col N="644" /> vices on an ongoing basis with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. Initial information from the National Intellectual Disability Database in relation to the level of service provision and identified need as of 30 May, which will reflect the impact of the 2000 development programme, will also be available in the early autumn. This information will assist my Department in this matter.</P>
    <P>The national monitoring committee consists of representatives of my Department, the Health Research Board, the chief executives of the health boards, the Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to People with Mental Handicap, the National Parents and Siblings Alliance and the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland. It is also involved in the monitoring of this programme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot at this stage give specific commitments in relation to levels of expenditure in 2002 for any particular service area as these matters will be decided as part of the discussions on the Estimates and budget for that year between my Department and the Department of Finance. I assure her that this Government will fulfil the commitment it gave in relation to meeting the needs of this population group when it initiated the current development programme.</P>

      <P>The chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board has informed me that the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of children who received orthodontic treatment in the past four years is not available.

      <P>The proposal from the Eastern Regional Health Authority for a grant-in-aid scheme was approved by my Department.

      <P>The capital programme for the health services under the national development plan represents a major initiative by the Government to radically improve the infrastructure of the service. My Department has overall strategic responsibility for the NDP so as to develop the health service infrastructure in a co-ordinated and effective manner. The prioritisation and delivery of individual capital projects at local level is primarily a matter for the health boards.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 billion was provided at the launch of the plan for the health service nationally for the period 2000 to 2006. As 2000 was the first year of the NDP for the health services, transitional arrangements applied in relation to capital funding for health boards to ensure that existing commitments were met while allowing scope for various new approvals throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> In relation to 2001 to 2006, capital funding was indicated to health boards for each of those years for various care programmes such as disability services, child care and acute hospitals. The actual funding available each year to individual health boards will depend on a number of factors including adjustments in respect of various issues such as inflation, changing service priorities, technological developments, new clinical practices, progress on the delivery of specific projects and market capacity in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>The development of Monaghan General Hospital is a matter for the North Eastern Health Board. A project team has been appointed. It is currently examining acute hospital services in the NEHB region, including the Monaghan site which is part of the Cavan/Monaghan Hospital group.</P>
    <P>The funding in relation to this initiative will be considered in the context of the £160 million funding made available to the board under the national development plan to prioritise and develop acute hospital services in its area.</P>

      <P>My Department has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the national development plan so as to develop the health service infrastructure in a co-ordinated and effective manner. The detailed management of capital projects within the NDP, including the prioritisation and delivery of projects, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority in this instance.</P>
      <P>In 2000 my Department indicated the funding available to the ERHA under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. In March, at short notice, my Department received an outline proposal from the ERHA for the purchase of land by the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street which, it was suggested, might accommodate a relocation of the hospital to a site adjacent to St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park at a very significant cost estimate. The ERHA indicated that it had not got the resources available to it to meet this acquisition or for the overall development. Having considered the matter on the basis of the information supplied, my Department advised the ERHA that there must be clear prioritisation in regard to projects that can be delivered within the authority's NDP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the many pressures on the NDP, both within the acute and non-acute hospital sectors in the ERHA covering many vulnerable groups such as older people, persons with disabilities and children, my Department advised the ERHA that if it felt that the project was a higher priority for the same level of investment than other projects <Col N="649" /> that it would have further discussions with the ERHA on the matter.</P>
    <P>The existing planning project for the current site of the National Maternity Hospital could cost in the region of £25 million and will deliver more space and facilities for the hospital generally. This project has been agreed with the hospital's board. It will be of considerable benefit to the hospital in regard to the upgrading of facilities and the development of key areas such as neonatal ICU and delivery suites.</P>

      <P>Response times are an important measure of the operational efficiency of the ambulance service and are monitored on an ongoing basis by the health boards. Response times vary in each health board area, depending on the geographic location of the ambulance centre in relation to the call out location.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that we have meaningful performance targets for the ambulance service. A combination of good clinical audit and response times offers the best way forward. Good progress has been made in this area with the introduction of the national patient report form and the recent introduction and implementation of standard operating procedures. The development of clinically based response times is a complex area and the views of the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, which I recently established, will be critical in developing a suitable system for use here. The council intends to commence a review of response times standards later this year and will report its findings to me when the project is complete.</P>
      <P>Considerable resources have been provided by my Department for the extension of 24 hour on duty cover in ambulance stations and two man crewing on all ambulances. These are important factors in improving response times and are a high priority for further investment in the future.</P>

The case mix programme, so-called because it compares the mix of cases that hospitals treat, taking varying complexity into account, compares activity and costs between the 32 main acute hospitals which account for almost 75% of all acute hospital activity and over £700 million of spending. The hospitals which participate in the programme receive a positive or negative financial adjustment based on performance. The programme is being expanded each year.

My Department was one of the public bodies selected for inclusion in the investigation and co-operated fully with the Office of the Information Commissioner in this regard.</P>
      <P>The volume of FOI requests received by my Department on a yearly basis has grown steadily since commencement, with a total of 452 requests received in the year 2000 and in excess of 230 requests received this year to date. While the Act reflects best administrative practice, difficulties have been encountered in meeting the statutory deadlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Information Commissioner's report which was published yesterday recommends that the Department review its procedures for dealing with requests under the FOI Act and take early action to address the deficiencies identified.

      <P>In 1999 my Department asked the National Disease Surveillance Centre to evaluate the problem of anti-microbial resistance in Ireland and to formulate a strategy for the future. The NDSC has given detailed consideration to these issues and has drawn up a document entitled Strategy for the control of Anti-microbial Resistance in Ireland, which I launched on 19 June. This report contains a wide range of detailed recommendations to address the issues, including those referred to by the Deputy. These can be grouped into four categories as follows: surveillance of resistance and antibiotic use; hygiene and prevention of infection; judicious use of antibiotics in hospitals and the community; and education of health care workers, patients and the general public. I welcome the recommendations in this report and am committed to ensuring their implementation.</P>
      <P>Ireland already participates in the European Anti-microbial Resistance Surveillance System and this has given us valuable data on anti-microbial resistance in Ireland. The EARRS program is supported by two established reference laboratories, the MRSA reference laboratory at St. James' Hospital and the streptococcus reference laboratory at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive national surveillance system for anti-microbial resistance will be established, building on the success of EARRS and the North-South MRSA study. This system will cover anti-microbial resistance in the community as well as the hospital setting and will be central to the implementation of the SARI recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> Tackling the problem of anti-microbial resistance is a multifaceted issue which will require action on a number of fronts. As a first step, in the current year £2 million has been provided to the health boards for anti-microbial resistance measures, taking into account the recommendations in SARI and in the North-South Study of MRSA in Ireland 1999. The boards have been asked to address in particular infection control strategies and staffing in both hospitals and the community, the development of surveillance systems for the collection of anti-microbial resistance data and information on antibiotic prescribing in hospitals. In addition, funding has been provided for the establishment of a national MRSA reference laboratory at St. James' Hospital in Dublin which, it is envisaged, will come into operation later this year.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the development of services in relation to anti-microbial resistance will take place on a phased basis over the next two to three years.</P>

      <P>The capital programme for the health services under the national development plan represents a major initiative by the Government to radically improve the infrastructure of our service. My Department has overall strategic responsibility for the NDP so as to develop the health service infrastructure in a co-ordinated and effective manner. The prioritisation and delivery of individual capital projects at local level is primarily a matter for the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £2 billion was provided at the launch <Col N="653" /> of the plan for the health service nationally for the period 2000 to 2006, inclusive. As 2000 was the first year of the NDP for the health services, transitional arrangements applied in relation to capital funding for health boards to ensure that existing commitments were met while allowing scope for various new approvals throughout the country. In relation to 2001 to 2006, inclusive, capital funding was indicated to health boards for each of those years for various care programmes such as disability services, child care and acute hospitals. The funding available each year to health boards will depend on a number of factors including adjustments in respect of various issues such as inflation, changing service priorities, technological developments, new clinical practices, progress on the delivery of specific projects and market capacity in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>Health boards have developed plans under the NDP for the years 2001 to 2006, inclusive, in line with the indicative funding levels notified to them by my Department at the commencement of the plan. The health board plans are expected to evolve over the period of the plan in line with prevailing service, financial and operational circumstances. It is therefore not possible at this stage to project the progress on individual projects proposed under the NDP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 164 to 166, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. In 1985 my Department issued guidelines to health boards on the criteria applicable in assessing priority of need for specialist orthodontic treatment; the guidelines are based on the degree of severity of malocclusion and assist in prioritising the need for treatment. A copy of these guidelines will be forwarded to the Deputy by my Department.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group on orthodontic services is entitled The Moran Report. It recommended that all health boards use the same severity index to determine need and that provision of orthodontic treatment should continue on the basis of priority need. There have been discussions between my Department and representatives of the chief executive officers of health boards on the report and its implications. Proposals in the report are being progressively implemented. Amendments to the 1985 guidelines are being finalised with the chief executive officers of the health boards and the review group on orthodontic services.</P>
      <P>The guidelines issued by my Department in 1985 and the proposed revision to the guidelines provide an index of severity to allow health board services determine the need for orthodontic treatment and provide services on an equitable basis. The service provided in the private sector is based on the assessment recommendations of individual orthodontists and may be based on a more lenient assessment of treatment need.</P>
      <P>Following the Moran review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>It will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private orthodontists to treat patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Eastern Regional Health Authority, two additional consultant orthodontists have been appointed and the recruitment of a fourth consultant orthodontist for the Northern Area Health Board is in train. Two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and the recruitment process for three managers to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards has been completed; two of the managers will commence duty in July and the third will take up duty next August. A six surgery facility at the Lough<Col N="655" /> linstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is currently being equipped. The equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James' Hospital orthodontic unit is being completed. The NAHB is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital. Agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics and four dentists will commence training in 2001. Validation of waiting lists is currently in progress.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board's proposals include the development of new orthodontic units in Tralee and North Cork and the recruitment of two additional consultant orthodontists; both positions were advertised last week. The board also proposes to commission four additional orthodontic chairs in the orthodontic unit in St. Finbarr's Hospital and to validate waiting lists. These proposals will double the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce waiting times from 48 months to under 12 months in the Southern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The proposals from the Midland, Mid-Western, North Eastern, North Western, South Eastern and Western Health Boards include the use of private orthodontists, the training of two specialists in orthodontics in the Dublin Dental Hospital to commence in October 2001 and the recruitment of three additional orthodontic specialists, one senior clinical dental surgeon, four dental surgery assistants and three administrative staff. Additional sessions by health board staff and validation of waiting lists are also proposed.</P>
    <P>The impact of the initiative in these health boards will enable an additional 2,500 patients approximately to commence treatment. The health boards have advised me that the ultimate effect of their proposals, when fully implemented, will be to increase the numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum and significantly reduce waiting times for treatment.</P>
    <P>The effect of the initiative is becoming evident in the short time of its existence. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that the numbers awaiting orthodontic treatment and assessment have been reduced by approximately 800 since the initiative commenced in the board. In addition, the chief executive officer of the ERHA has informed me that the recruitment of additional clinical staff has allowed treatment to commence or recommence for approximately 1,150 patients since September 2000.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the chief executive officers of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland, Mid-Western, South Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards that records are maintained on all patients who are assessed for orthodontic treatment. Records of why patients have been refused are kept on the patient's clinical charts. Statistical information in respect of these is not available.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board has informed me that primary school children are assessed in respect of the need for orthodontic treatment and if categorised as either category A or B under the guidelines issued by my Department, are referred to the orthodontic service in the health board. Category C patients are not treated by the health board in the regional orthodontic unit and therefore no records are maintained in respect of these patients.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the chief executive officer of the North Western Health Board that children are assessed by the consultant orthodontist who prioritises patients again according to my Department's guidelines. Categories A and B are placed on the orthodontic waiting list according to their priority. Patients who are assigned to lower designated categories are referred to primary care services for treatment. Therefore no patients are refused treatment in his area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>In relation to equity of services, the report of the review group on orthodontic services, entitled The Moran Report, recommended that all health boards use the same severity index to determine need and that provision of orthodontic treatment should continue on the basis of priority need. There have been discussions between my Department and representatives of the chief executive officers of health boards on the report and its implications. Proposals in the report are being progressively implemented. Amendments to the 1985 guidelines are being finalised with the chief executive officers of health boards and the review group on orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>There is considerable interest throughout the country in developing GP out of hours co-operatives. In that regard, my Department recently held a national conference on this subject which was very well attended by GPs, health board personnel and other interested parties. The conference threw up a lot of very useful information, debate and issues for further consideration.</P>
      <P>The present position is that I am expecting the report of the independent evaluation of the two major GP out of hours co-operatives in the North Eastern and South Eastern Health Boards within the next few weeks.

However, the position remains as stated in my reply to the Deputy on 13 June 2001 that, given a positive outcome to the evaluation process, I hope to be in a position, in association with the board, to support the project from an appropriate date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>Waiting list figures are collated from data supplied by the health agencies and relate to the numbers waiting for procedures at the hospitals within their areas only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The waiting times data supplied show the number of adults waiting for procedures in the following two categories &ndash; those waiting between three and 12 months and those waiting more than 12 months. The waiting times for children are also <Col N="662" /> supplied in two categories &ndash; those waiting between three and six months and those waiting more than six months.</P>
    <P>The hospital in-patient waiting list data for the Midland Health Board area as at 31 March, the latest date for which figures are available, show that there were 84 patients waiting for hip replacements at hospitals in the Midland Health Board area and that there were 1,004 patients waiting for ENT procedures at hospitals in the area. Of those waiting for hip replacements, 60 patients are waiting between three and 12 months and 24 patients are waiting longer than 12 months. Of those adults waiting for ENT procedures, 252 are waiting between three and 12 months and 475 are waiting 12 months and over. The number of children waiting between three and six months for ENT procedures is 69 and the number waiting six months and more is 208.</P>
    <P>The overall target for waiting list initiative funding is to ensure that no adult waits longer than 12 months and that no child waits longer than six months for treatment. It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34 million was allocated in 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made inquiries of the Irish Medicines Board about this matter. It has indicated that arrangements for the reporting of suspected adverse reactions to medicinal products began in 1968 and that, in the early years of this system, the level of reporting was relatively low in general. In the case of Trivax, four suspected adverse reactions to it were reported to the National Drugs Advisory Board, the predecessor of the IMB, in 1972 and 1973.</P>
      <P>In 1972/3 the Eastern Health Board recorded 100 suspected adverse reactions to Trivax. These were the subject of correspondence with Wellcome and were jointly investigated by the EHB and the company.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority has not succeeded in tracing any records in relation to whether these suspected adverse reactions were notified to the NDAB. The IMB has no record of having received reports from the health board about these cases. It should be noted that while there were no formal procedures-guidelines in place for reporting of suspected adverse reactions by companies at that time, there was an informal agreement with companies to periodically provide the NDAB with information on suspected adverse reactions. This is among a number of issues which the IMB has recently raised with the GlaxoSmithKline. The company's response is at present awaited by the IMB.</P>
      <P>As regards present-day arrangements for reporting of adverse reactions, one of the conditions of the product authorisations granted by the IMB, in respect of medicinal products being placed on the market here, is that the authorisation holder shall furnish to the board a copy of any report of adverse reactions associated with the use of the preparation to which the authorisation relates of which he has a record or of which he is aware. In addition, reports of suspected adverse drug reactions are received on a voluntary basis from healthcare professionals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Report details are included by the IMB on a <Col N="665" /> computerised database to facilitate processing and evaluation of reports.</P>

      <P>National policy on the treatment of alcohol abuse, as set out in Planning for the Future, stipulates that the emphasis in the management of alcohol-related problems should be on community based intervention rather than on specialist inpatient treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> The provision of services for the treatment of alcohol-related problems in the NEHB is based on the board's strategy document on alcoholism and addiction. The development of services has been community based with particular emphasis on early intervention and close links with the primary care services. Detoxification is now predominantly home based and is supervised by general practitioners. Admissions to general medical wards take place in a small number of cases and occasional admissions to St. Davnet's Hospital take place where there are major behavioural problems or in the context of psychiatric morbidity.</P>
    <P>Health boards generally are also considering ways in which services provided by voluntary and/or private facilities might integrate with their services. In this connection, the NEHB has made arrangements to enable access to specialist in-patient treatment facilities in the small number of cases where the need arises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The activities of body piercing services are not covered by legislation and I have no plans to regulate them. Under the Infectious Disease Regulations, 1981, health boards are empowered, where there is reason to believe that a possible source of infection exists, to carry out an investigation and to take such steps as are necessary or desirable for investigating the nature and source of such infection, for preventing the spread of infection and for removing conditions favourable to such infection.</P>
      <P>My Department is in the process of preparing good practice guidelines for tattooing and body piercing. It is intended that these guidelines will also serve to assist environmental health officers in their inspection of premises under the infectious diseases regulations. It is also intended to produce an advice and information leaflet for the general public about the possible risks attached to tattooing and body piercing.</P>
      <P>While a considerable amount of work has been undertaken to date, the guidelines are not yet finalised. Further consideration of the issues involved and further consultation with appropriate interested parties is necessary before my Department will be in a position to bring the guidelines to completion. Due to other competing demands it is not possible at this stage to put a timeframe on the completion of these guidelines.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of health services to persons living in County Westmeath rests with the Midland Health Board. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive of the board to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly. I assure the Deputy it is established policy in health care that emergency cases should be treated as a priority.</P>

      <P>My Department provides a block grant to the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, from which DTO determines, at its own discretion, grant payments to individual local authorities within the greater Dublin area for traffic management improvements, including, where appropriate, park and ride facilities. In one year only, 1999, a budgetary supplement was provided to DTO specifically for the promotion of park and ride facilities. Such a specific supplement has not been made in the context of the larger general grant allocations made by my Department to DTO in 2000 and 2001.</P>

      <P>Licensing fees structure for small public service vehicles generally were revised in the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations, 2000. The assessment in this context of the appropriate revised fee for taxi licences had to take account of the need, in light of relevant court decisions, not to place or authorise any restriction on new taxi licence numbers, to ensure some differential or incentive in relation to the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis, and to ensure bona fide public service intent on the part of taxi licence applicants in the context of the extra privileges available to taxis, including, in particular, access to with flow bus lanes.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the reasonably substantial initial licence fee of £5,000 was specified for taxis. I have already indicated that it is intended that the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible by end 2003 and to consult extensively with a range of representative groups to develop further quality improvements for taxi services in the medium term. My Department will finalise a consultation document in this regard in the near future. Implementation of this policy is likely to entail a review of the current fees for small public service vehicle licences.</P>

      <P>The maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in this area is a matter for Cavan and Monaghan County Councils to be funded from their own resources, supplemented by State grants. In the 2001 grant allocations for non-national roads, I allocated a total of £10.458 million to Cavan County Council and £9.489 million to Monaghan County Council representing increases of 14% and 15% on the 2000 initial allocations of £9.207 million and £8.269 million and increases of 46% and 50% on the 1997 grants of £7.146 million and £6.326 million respectively. It is estimated that Cavan and Monaghan County Council will provide a further £1.86 million and £1.4 million from their own resources in 2001.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the significantly increased level of State funding provided in recent years, supplemented by county councils' own resources, is providing adequately for the ongoing maintenance and improvement needs of the non-national road network and is assisting in its systematic and accelerated improvement in both counties.</P>

      <P>One of the principal requirements of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, is the preparation, adoption and implementation by local authorities of five year programmes to accelerate the provision of accommodation for Travellers camped on unofficial sites or on the roadside. All relevant local authorities have adopted and are currently implementing their respective programmes, involving the provision of some 3,785 units of accommodation over the five year period from 2000 to 2004. The increased provision of accommodation resulting from the implementation of the programmes will address the needs of those Traveller families seeking accommodation and ensure that all authorities play their part in the provision of Traveller accommodation.</P>
      <P>In the period between the publication of the report of the task force in July 1995 to the end of 2000, some 789 units of Traveller accommodation were provided, comprised of 319 units of Traveller specific accommodation and 470 units of standard local authority housing. At the end of 2000, work on the provision of 25 new halting site bays was in progress and 27 bays were being refurbished; there were 67 new group houses in progress with a further 22 being refurbished.</P>
      <P>In the current year to date, work on the provision of 38 new bays, the refurbishment of three existing bays and 28 new group houses has commenced and my Department has sanctioned the provision of 62 new group houses and refurbishment of 28 halting site bays. The annual count of Traveller families undertaken in November 2000 shows that, compared to 1999, the number of families on the roadside fell, for the first time in a number of years, from 1,207 to 1,093. This decrease, while welcome, is still modest and I will be seeking its significant acceleration over the remaining years of the accommodation programmes.</P>

      <P>The national Traveller accommodation consultative committee, NTACC, recently submitted a report to me on its evaluation of each of the 38 local Traveller accommodation programmes. The report comprised an assessment of the 38 programmes and an evaluation of their compliance with the requirements of section 10 of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, and the advice and guidance contained in my Department's memorandum on implementation of the Act, which issued to local authorities in November 1998.</P>
      <P>The Act did not require that local authorities identify specific locations or sites for the provision of accommodation under the programme. The NTACC report indicates that, of the 38 programmes adopted, the majority &ndash; 26 &ndash; identified at least the general areas and locations where the accommodation is to be provided. Several programmes indicated that it was not possible to be site specific at the time of preparation and adoption of the programme for a number of reasons, for example, the unavailability of suitable lands in the authority's ownership, the difficulty in identifying suitable land to purchase and build on, the unavailability of suitable dwellings to purchase in the area required to meet individual family needs and, in some cases, the lack of precise information on individual family requirements. Many programmes indicated that the process of site identification was ongoing at the time of adoption of the programmes.</P>
      <P>In relation to transient sites, six of the 38 programmes indicate that it is not proposed to provide such sites on the basis that a need for such a site had not been identified in the assessment of needs which they carried out in accordance with the 1998 Act. Three authorities indicate that transient sites will be provided should a need be identified over the lifetime of the programme. The remaining 29 programmes indicate that transient site(s) will be provided as part of the overall accommodation provision, with some authorities indicating that transient site provision will be pursued in a co-ordinated way with neighbouring authorities.</P>
      <P>Section 17 of the 1998 Act requires that a review of each Traveller accommodation programme be carried out at least once every three years. The NTACC's report on the local programmes indicates that seven of the 38 programmes &ndash; 18% &ndash; do not include proposals for a review of their programmes. However, 19 programmes &ndash; 50% &ndash; include proposals for a review either annually or after one year of operation, three &ndash; 8% &ndash; will be reviewed at the statutory time, that is, after three years, and nine &ndash; 24% &ndash; indicate that elements of the programme will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>The scheme to which the Deputy refers provides for a special half rate old age contributory pension from 5 May 2000 for people who commenced insurable employment before 1953 and who had at least five years paid insurance comprising either national health insurance or a combination of social insurance or national health insurance.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction, a total of almost 18,700 applications for the pre-1953 pension have been received from people not previously getting a pension from my Department. Some 8,900 of these applications have been decided and pensions were awarded to some 6,100 of people in these cases. A further 9,800 applications are at various stages of processing. In addition to the applications already decided, a further 8,500 pre-1953 pensions have also been awarded to people already in receipt of a <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory or retirement pension at a lower weekly personal rate. This brings the total number already benefiting from this initiative to 14,600.</P>
      <P>At the time I introduced this scheme, it was expected that some 3,000 people would benefit from this improvement. I am pleased to say the take up has far exceeded expectations. An unfortunate downside of this success is that it has not been possible to process all claims as quickly as I would have wished. The pre-1953 claims take longer than normal to process for a variety of reasons. These include the lapse of time since the relevant employment and the difficulties of tracing old insurance records in respect of employments over 50 years old. The delay could have been eliminated or greatly reduced by deferring the operative date, but I decided not to do so on the basis that those affected should benefit from the provisions as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The processing of these claims has been organised on a once-off project basis. This is the most appropriate means of handling a new initiative involving a significant bulge in claims intake which are not part of the standard pension process and which would require some time to resolve. A consequence of this is that the information on the average time to process claims is not maintained on an ongoing basis as would be the case with non-project workloads.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to deal with the applications received as quickly as possible. It had been hoped to clear all the pre-1953 claims by the end of this year, but this is becoming more unlikely as the number of new applications received is still running at a level of 300 a week on average. I assure the Deputy that the delay in processing applications will not result in any losses to pensioners who are awarded pre-1953 pensions. Their claims will be backdated in accordance with the normal provisions governing the backdating of pension claims.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on my Department's behalf by the community welfare service in the health boards. An inter-departmental working group is reviewing the scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The current review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed primarily at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. All aspects of the scheme are being examined. The review also provides an opportunity to re-focus the scheme, and for the health boards' community welfare service, of which it is part, to become more effective in tackling poverty and social exclusion.</P>
      <P>The first stage of the review is now nearing completion. This involved an examination of the objectives of the scheme and included a widespread consultation process. A total of 145 submissions were received from users of the supplementary welfare allowance service, information providers and other interested parties, including the social partners, the health boards who administer the scheme and the trade unions representing community welfare officers. These submissions are being considered and will inform the deliberations of the inter-departmental working group, which will resume its work after the summer break. I expect its proposals will be finalised next year.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The SWA scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each health board is required to set reasonable maximum rent levels in respect of various classes of persons, for example, single persons, couples <Col N="676" /> and lone parents with one child, as a basis for calculating the amount of rent supplement payable. The limits are set using local knowledge as to what constitutes a reasonable rent for private rented accommodation for various household types within and across the health board area.</P>
    <P>These maximum rent levels are reviewed regularly by the boards to take account of fluctuations in accommodation costs observed in each area. When accommodation is no longer available within these limits, rent levels are reviewed and revised upwards at the initiative of the health boards in the light of their experience in dealing with claims for rent supplement. In June 2000, the maximum rent level set by the health boards for rent supplement purposes for a three bedroom semi-detached house in the Dublin area was £700 per month. The equivalent figure for June 2001 was £850 per month, representing an increase of 21%.</P>
    <P>The current maximum rent levels, as set by the Health Boards, in relation to families in the Dublin area and the percentage increase on the rates set 12 months ago are shown in the following tabular statement. At the end of December 2000 there were 42,683 people in receipt of a rent supplement throughout the country. This total includes 18,609 in the functional area of the Eastern Regional Health Authority which covers Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.</P>

    <P>*These are claims against the estates of deceased persons where over-payments have arisen on their social welfare claims, usually due to an understatement of means.</P>
    <P>In the year 2000, a total of £9.6 million was recovered in respect of overpayments. This included ongoing recovery of over-payments assessed in previous years. Generally non-fraud and estate over-payments arise through customer error, omission or where there is insufficient or no evidence of fraudulent intent. In a minority of cases, over-payments are attributable to departmental error. There is no readily available breakdown of the non-fraud and estate cases as between over-payments arising from departmental error and over-payments arising from errors or omissions by the customer.</P>
    <P>It is departmental policy to endeavour to recover in full all moneys incorrectly paid and for some years now a code of practice, S.I. No. 227 of 1996, has been in place to regulate this process. The method and pace of recovery is determined having regard to the individual circumstances and where the over-payment was due to departmental or health board error.

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he will extend the free travel allowance to those who are unable to avail of the scheme due to the lack of public transport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The free travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas. My Department is always willing to consider further applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the free schemes was published in April last year by the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin. The review considered the difficulties involved in access to public transport services. In this regard it notes that there are two main groups affected: those who have a disability which prevents them using the service and those for <Col N="678" /> whom a service does not exist, which mainly affects those living in rural areas. This problem, which is unrelated to the free travel scheme, is part of a wider social and infrastructure problem, affecting all those who are disadvantaged and who can neither afford their own transport or avail of access to public transport.</P>
    <P>The review notes that while my Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme, it is not obliged to provide services where none exist, nor is it in a position to provide vehicles accessible to people with disabilities. These are matters for the transport providers concerned and for my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, who has responsibility for public transport. In this regard, an important initiative was launched this week, details of which I outline below.</P>
    <P>The review examined a number of alternatives to the existing system including the use of vouchers. It considered that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be complicated and less feasible than the current system. Voucher schemes, by their nature, can introduce stigma to a scheme. The use of vouchers is not in keeping with a fundamental aspect of the scheme as originally envisaged, that of using existing spare capacity on public transport as it covers the country. It would do little to facilitate the provision of public transport services where none exist nor would it facilitate the provision of accessible public transport.</P>
    <P>However, the review of the free schemes does recommend that a social transport fund be supported and made available to voluntary and community based organisations for the provision of local transport initiatives that would be unlikely to operate without a subsidy. Such a fund would be mainly social in nature and could facilitate the provision of wheelchair accessible vehicles. The review considered it appropriate that such a fund could be managed locally, perhaps by the local authorities, in view of their knowledge of local services and to maintain community autonomy. This proposal needs to be considered further by the relevant Government departments.</P>
    <P>In this regard, an interdepartmental working group on rural transport has been established, chaired by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and including a representative from my Department, to consider how best to address the rural transport deficit. The group has been charged with the development of a template which can be used by each county development board in carrying out a comprehensive countywide audit of rural passenger transport services to establish the extent to which people in rural Ireland have access to such services and to establish reasonable rural passenger transport needs. In this regard, a consultancy study has recently been initiated which will provide technical assistance in the template development.</P>
    <P>I understand the audits will serve two main purposes, namely, to form part of the wide rang<Col N="679" /> ing audit of services which is being undertaken by each county development board in the context of their preparation of their county strategy for economic, social and cultural development, and to assist the Government in developing policy proposals on rural passenger transport.</P>
    <P>In addition, my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, announced this week an important rural transport initiative. A sum of £3.5 million has been provided for under the national development plan to support the development of pilot public transport initiatives in rural areas. The aim of the funding is to encourage innovative community based initiatives to provide transport services in rural areas with a view to addressing the issue of social exclusion in rural Ireland which is caused by lack of access to transport. The pilot actions supported by these funds will allow for a body of knowledge and experience on the subject to be developed, assimilated and disseminated. The successful types of services, operational methods and means of organisation will emerge, and these will be a guide to future policy formulation.</P>

      <P>The treatment benefit scheme provides a range of benefits in the areas of dental, optical and aural treatment for qualified PRSI contributors and their dependent spouses. The PRSI contributions which are reckonable for treatment benefit are classes A, E, H and P. The PRSI contribution conditions relating to entitlement to these benefits vary depending on the age of the insured person. Persons aged under 21 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work in order to qualify while persons aged from 21 to 24 must have at least 39 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons aged from 25 to 65, the requirement is that they have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in the relevant tax year. Persons aged 66 or over are required to have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid since first starting work and 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited in either of the last two tax years before reaching age 66.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any change in the insurance conditions for <Col N="680" /> receipt of treatment benefits would have financial implications and would be a matter for consideration within the constraints of available resources. While I have no specific proposals at present for changing the qualifying conditions of the areas within the treatment benefit scheme, the operation of the scheme is subject to ongoing monitoring by my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 and 216 together.</P>
      <P>At £850 million, last December's social welfare budget allocation is the biggest ever and more than double last year's welfare package. This allocation will, to an unprecedented extent, direct the resources of the State at the needs of our disadvantaged citizens and communities. Among the most significant of these improvements are a £10 a week increase for single old age pensioners, an increase of up to £25 a week for pensioner couples of 66 years and over, a special increase of £12.90 for contributory widows and widowers over 66 years, an £8 a week increase for other single recipients under 66 years, a £15 increase for couples under 66 years and £25 and £30 increases in monthly child benefit for the lower and higher rates, respectively, with increases paid three months earlier from June.</P>
      <P>The £10 increase for pensioners represents an increase ranging between 10.4% and 11.7%, while the £8 general increase represents an increase ranging between 9% and 10.5%. With a predicted annual average rate of inflation of 4.5% this year, this year's improvements represent substantial real increases. The special increase for contributory widows or widowers, pensioners and recipients of deserted wife's benefit aged 66 years and over amounts to an overall increase of 14.5%.</P>
      <P>In addition, increases ranging between 13.1% and 17.4% in the rate of qualified adult allowances were provided this year as part of an overall strategy to increase this allowance to 70% of the main rate by 2002. The additional increase for qualified adults aged 66 and over of contributory pensioners represents combined increases of between 23.2% and 25.9%. Again these increases represent significant real increases. Furthermore, as part of the process of aligning tax and social welfare changes by 2001, all these increases have been paid four weeks earlier this year from the beginning of April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> As part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government has entered into a number of social inclusion commitments with the social partners. This programme provides that over the period up to 2003, all rates of social welfare will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 a week for the lower rates of payment. For families, substantial progress will be made towards a target child benefit rate of £100 per month for the third and subsequent child. Any further increases in the levels of old age and widows pensions would have financial implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and having regard to the Government's other priorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made in the services and supports available for people with disabilities since this Government took up office, including significant improvements in social welfare payments. For instance, last December's record social welfare budget package provided for a £10 per week increase for people with disabilities and their carers aged 66 years and over and an £8 per week increase for people with disabilities and their carers aged under 66 years. In addition, increases have been paid four weeks earlier than last year, from April 2001, fuel allow<Col N="682" /> ance has been extended by three extra weeks, from the first week in October to late April, an additional £6 per week living alone allowance is being paid to recipients of invalidity pension, disability allowance, unemployability supplement and blind person's pension from April 2001, full rate disability allowance is being paid where the person's partner is in receipt of any other social welfare payment, from April 2001, amounting to weekly increases of between £35 and £46, current exemption of income of up to £150,000 from the sale of a pensioner's residence has been extended to people getting disability allowance and blind person's pension from April 2001, weekly income disregards for carer's allowance have been increased from £75 for single people and £150 for couples to £125 and £250 respectively from April 2001, respite care grant has been increased from £300 to £400 and £800 grant is paid to carers looking after two or more people, access to back to education allowance for all people with disabilities following completion of a community employment scheme and £1 million extra allocated to the comhairle information service.</P>
    <P>These measures build on the other improvements which I have introduced and which apply to all people with disabilities regardless of the nature of their impairment. For example, all payments to people with disabilities and their carers have been substantially increased in real terms, a range of measures have been introduced to improve access to disability allowance for people in full-time residential care, various measures have been introduced to facilitate people with disabilities in accessing employment, training and educational opportunities, significant improvements in the assessment of capital for disability allowance and blind person's pension purposes have been introduced leading to a fivefold increase from £2,000 to £10,000 in the amount of capital which is disregarded for means test purposes.</P>
    <P>The question of further improvements in social welfare payments for people with disabilities is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, in the light of available resources and having regard to the Government's other priorities in this area.</P>

      <P>Free schemes are generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or pass a means test. They are also available to carers and certain people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. They must also satisfy conditions as to household composition.</P>
      <P>From October 2000 the schemes were extended to all those over 75 years regardless of income or household composition, and from May 2001 everyone aged over 70 may qualify on this basis. When a person who is in receipt of free scheme benefits dies, the surviving spouse may retain these benefits, provided she or he is aged between 60 and 65. If, however, the couple were separated and living in separate households at the time of death, the surviving spouse would not retain the benefits. Separated couples may each qualify for free schemes in their own right, provided they meet the qualifying conditions of the schemes.</P>

      <P>My Department still has not been formally advised of the Advocate General's opinion in this case although I am advised the opinion has been published. I await the advice of the Chief State Solicitor's Office in the matter. However, it is important to note that these proceedings and the Advocate General's opinion reflect the position at the time of the issue of the proceedings against Ireland and that matters have changed significantly in the interim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has now completed the transmission to the EU Commission in accordance with Article 4(1) of the Habitats Directive its proposals for SAC designations in respect of 362 <Col N="685" /> sites.

This seminar will be asked to assess our proposals for SACs in the light of currently available scientific information.

If deficiencies are identified for a small number of habitats or species, further decisions will be taken in the light of the conclusions of the seminar.</P>
    <P>The decision in the First Corporate Shipping case is that a member state may not take account of economic, social and cultural requirements or regional and local characteristics, as mentioned in Article 2(3) of the directive, when selecting and defining the boundaries of the sites to be proposed to the Commission as eligible for identification as sites of Community importance.</P>

      <P>The Curragh of Kildare is of conservation value for a number of reasons. It is unusual in that it is an extensive open plain area of lowland acidic grassland succeeding to dry heath in places. It has been grazed, but not fertilised for hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of years. Because of the management regime on the open grassland, nationally important populations <Col N="686" /> of rare fungi are found. Accordingly, the Curragh is proposed for designation as a natural heritage area under the Wildlife Acts, 1976 to 2000. The Curragh, however, does not meet the strict scientific criteria necessary for designation as a candidate special area of conservation &ndash; CSAC &ndash; under the European habitats directive. It does not, in fact, contain any priority habitat listed in the habitats directive.</P>
      <P>The Curragh is of national importance for populations of wintering golden plover, a species that is listed on annex I of the EU birds directive. Flocks of 3,000 birds have been recorded regularly since the winter of 1994-95, but the golden plover is not present in internationally important numbers on this site. Lapwing, in flocks of approximately 200 birds, also occur regularly on the site. The ungrazed grasslands of the turf club are used by nesting meadow pipit and skylark. No site with similar habitat has been designated as a special protection area &ndash; SPA &ndash; under the birds directive.</P>

      <P>I am advised, after consultation with Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, and Birdwatch Ireland, that there have been no positive sightings of nightjars in the Dungarvan Harbour area of County Waterford in 2001.</P>
      <P>In previous years there was an unconfirmed report received by Birdwatch Ireland of a sighting of a pair of nightjars in the Dungarvan area. Nightjars are summer visitors from Africa and occur mainly in dry upland heathland. They have been sighted in the south-east of Ireland, in counties Wexford, Waterford, Tipperary and also in Cork.</P>

      <P>The preparation of commonage framework plans being carried out jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is well advanced. Work has been completed on plans covering almost 350,000 hectares of commonage, or 71% of the total. For upland commonage in the six western counties, to which the interim 30% destocking was applied, work is 90% complete. Publication will not be possible until the plans have been completed for all these commonages. Due to delays arising from the foot and mouth disease crisis the work has been set back by approximately three months.</P>

      <P>The Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) requires member states to propose relevant natural areas for designation as special areas of conservation for the conservation of listed habitats and species and to protect their favourable conservation status. The directive was transposed into Irish law in February 1997 by means of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997. A total of 362 sites, covering almost 1,000,000 hectares of land and water, have been formally transmitted to the Commission to date as candidate special areas of conservation. These proposals will be assessed at the Atlantic region bio-geographical seminar which is scheduled to take place in September 2001. As matters stand, the sites are fully protected under national legislation.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the number and extent of SACs that I have proposed, I anticipate that Ireland's proposals will be found sufficient for most habitats and species, with the exception of salmon, at the second Atlantic region bio-geographical seminar in September of this year. I have decided in principle to propose new or extended SACs for the protection of salmon but these cannot be formally proposed until surveys to define their boundaries have been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) requires member states to protect birds and to establish <Col N="688" /> special protection areas for areas hosting internationally important populations of bird species and for bird habitats. To date 110 SPAs have been established covering 220,000 hectares of land. I propose to extend some existing SPAs and designate up to 30 new SPAs when the necessary survey work is completed and I expect to have this process completed in 2002.</P>

      <P>I am unable to provide the data in the form requested by the Deputy. Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, does not currently have access to data relating to agricultural coverage. I point out that candidate special areas of conservation are inclusive of inland water bodies and marine areas and, therefore, are not directly comparable with land area for each county.</P>
      <P>I have, however, provided the total area in hectares of candidate special areas of conservation as well as a percentage breakdown of the total CSAC area on a county basis in the following table. At the time of advertisement of proposed SAC designations, copies of the maps are forwarded to the landowners known to Dúchas. In addition, maps are forwarded to the relevant planning authority, the local Teagasc office, the local farm development service, as well as the EPA, An Bord Pleanála and interested Departments so they may be made available for public inspection. In excess of 220,000 hectares have been designated as special protection areas. I will make arrangements to have a breakdown on a county basis forwarded to the Deputy shortly.</P>

      <P>Planning applications are the responsibility of the planning authorities &ndash; generally the relevant county council &ndash; and An Bord Pleanála in accordance with the planning and development Acts. The only role that my Department has in such matters arises where concerns exist about the impact of proposed developments on the built and natural heritage. In such cases, Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, makes observations or objections, as appropriate, to the relevant planning authority. The number of objections submitted by Dúchas to Clare County Council was 21, 17 and one in 1999, 2000 and 2001 to date, respectively. The number of appeals subsequently submitted to An Bord Pleanála in the same periods was three, five and nil, respectively. As the Deputy will under<Col N="690" /> stand, submissions by Dúchas are only one element considered by the relevant authorities during the planning process. In all cases, the final decision on each individual planning application rests with the planning authority or An Bord Pleanála, as appropriate.</P>

I am pleased to confirm I agreed to allow an extra week's grazing, on a farm by farm basis, during the month of June this year. In the light of restrictions resulting from the foot and mouth disease alert, I instructed Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, to be as flexible as possible when dealing with applications from farmers for this additional week's grazing. I understand from direct contact that farming interests in the Burren were happy with this approach.</P>

      <P>Operation Trace was established by the Garda Commissioner for the specific purpose of establishing whether any common denominator linked any of the cases of six women who went missing in Leinster between 1993 and 1998. In the light of the present workload relating to Operation Trace, operational reassignments have been made by the Garda Commissioner. I am informed by the Garda authorities that overall responsibility for the Operation Trace unit will still be maintained by a detective superintendent. Any new information or intelligence coming to hand will be thoroughly investigated and evalu<Col N="692" /> ated and searches will be carried out whenever and wherever considered warranted.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that Garda inquiries are ongoing in relation to all missing persons. The Garda district officer of the area from which the person has gone missing takes direct responsibility for the investigation and employs all necessary investigative means, including, as required, the services of all specialist units. Moreover, a Garda liaison officer is appointed to liaise with one appointed family member and updates them on any developments that take place. In addition, an administrative and statistical function is maintained at the Missing Persons Bureau, Garda Headquarters.</P>
      <P>The issue of a centralised Garda national missing persons unit is kept under continuous review. I understand that the Garda Commissioner considers that investigations of missing persons are more effective when they have the kind of local focus that is achieved under existing arrangements. I would emphasise, however, that all relevant Garda structures and methodologies are constantly under review.</P>
      <P>Although the funding of a dedicated helpline and counselling services for the families of missing persons would not normally fall within the responsibilities of my Department, I have asked my Department to consider how this might be brought about either with my own Department's support or through another State-funded agency. Moreover, I understand that health boards may be in a position to offer appropriate counselling and support services to those members of a declared missing person's family who are identified as being in need of such services. I further understand that the provision of these services is, in the first instance, a matter for each health board, having regard to needs in individual cases.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the continuing complaints by members of the public regarding the unsatisfactory handling of complaints concerning members of the legal profession, he will consider, as a matter of urgency, establishing a legal ombudsman to handle complaints arising from the activities of solicitors and barristers.</Quest>

      <P>The Solicitors Acts, 1954 to 1994, provide for a disciplinary tribunal to deal with complaints of misconduct against solicitors. The tribunal consists of ten solicitor members and five lay members. The lay members are appointed on my nomination. A member of the public or the Law Society may apply to the tribunal for an inquiry into the conduct of a solicitor. In addition to the functions of the tribunal in relation to misconduct, the solicitors acts give power to the Law Society to impose sanctions on solicitors for inadequate services or for charging excessive fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> A member of the public who is dissatisfied with how the Law Society handles a complaint made to it may refer the matter to the adjudicator appointed under the Solicitors (Adjudicator) Regulations, 1997. The adjudicator can require the production of documents and make conclusions of fact and recommendations. He may direct the society to re-examine or reinvestigate the related complaint made to it about a solicitor where he is not satisfied that the society has investigated the complaint adequately. He may also direct the society to make an application to the disciplinary tribunal for an inquiry into the conduct of the solicitor on the ground of alleged misconduct.</P>
    <P>Complaints of misconduct against barristers are dealt with by the barristers' professional conduct tribunal, which has lay persons among its members. While I am aware that individual members of the public feel aggrieved from time to time, the existing system for dealing with complaints against members of the legal profession appears to operate in a generally satisfactory manner. However, I intend to move amendments to the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1998, which is awaiting Committee Stage in the Dáil having been passed by the Seanad, in order to make the disciplinary regime for solicitors more effective in certain respects.</P>

      <P>Section 9(1) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended requires that a person who claims asylum upon arrival in the State be admitted, even if they do not fulfil the normal criteria for entry. In conjunction with the commencement in full by me of the refugee Act in November 2000, a series of training courses dealing with the Act were held for immigration officers. The instructions issued at these courses emphasised the obligation on an immigration officer to assist an asylum applicant in making his or her application and to comply generally with the provisions of the Act. In addition, the Garda authorities have issued a headquarters directive concerning the provisions of the Act for the information of all members of the Garda Síochana, including those members assigned as immigration officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immigration officers at Dublin Airport and elsewhere are members of the Garda Síochana and are subject to the Garda Síochana Discipline Regulations, 1989, as well as to the provisions of <Col N="694" /> the Garda Síochana (Complaints) Act, 1986. It is open to any member of the public, irrespective of their nationality, who has been directly affected by or who witnesses conduct of the nature described by the Deputy to make a complaint to the Garda Síochana Complaints Board in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that immigration officers at Dublin airport are affording the opportunity to seek asylum to those who wish to do so, including Gambian nationals. During the period January 2001 to date a total of 31 Gambian nationals sought asylum upon arrival at Dublin Airport and were given leave to enter in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act.</P>

      <P>I am obliged, under the forthcoming Children Bill, currently awaiting the signature of the President, to provide separate secure detention facilities for juveniles aged 16 to 17 years. The Prison Service is currently exploring possible sites for such a secure facility in the Dublin area. The Jamestown Road location is one of the sites under consideration. A key element of the requirements for juvenile facilities is that they should be located with ready access to public transport. This is to allow the families of the young persons detained to visit on a regular basis and thus avoid unnecessary hardship.</P>

      <P>Under the sports capital programme administered by my Department, it is a condition for grantees to execute a deed of trust in respect of facilities in receipt of grant aid above a certain threshold. The deed of trust provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. To enable a deed of trust to be executed at present, the grantees must either own the property or have a long-term lease of 35 years. The deeds of trust are prepared by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
      <P>My Department is presently engaged in discussions with the CSS with a view to introducing a system which would expedite the execution of deeds of trust and improve the current procedures in time for the 2002 sports capital programme, which I hope to be able to publicly advertise before the end of this year. The Deputy should be aware that under the 2001 programme the grant threshold for which a deed of trust is required has been increased from £39,000 to £60,000.</P>
      <P>With regard to the particular club to which the Deputy refers, a grant of £80,000 was provisionally allocated under the 2000 sports capital programme. I understand from the CSS that the deed of trust has recently been received from the solicitors acting on behalf of the club and that searches are being carried out at present. When the searches have been completed, the deed of trust will be forwarded to my Department for execution, which will follow immediately.</P>

As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Children living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.

      <Quest>if his Department received requests from the Bray Project national school, County Wicklow, or from the parents of children attending this school, expressing concern at the cutbacks in the area of secretarial assistance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is in receipt of correspondence regarding the issue of secretarial assistance at Bray Project national school. I will reply directly to the correspondence setting out the position as follows.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Bray Project national school is currently in receipt of funding towards secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme.</P>
      <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 <Col N="698" /> million in 1999, was increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will be further increased this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding this issue. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that, as CE schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department. The transfer of such moneys to my Department will result in significant improvements in assistance towards ancillary services for schools. The discussions are at an advanced stage and I hope to make a further announcement regarding this matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>The third level student support schemes operated under the aegis of my Department provide a means tested grant to students who are pursuing their first undergraduate or postgraduate course and who comply with the terms and conditions of the schemes. The assessment of means for all applications under the schemes is based on gross income from all sources, with certain social welfare and health board payments not taken into account in the calculation of reckon<Col N="699" /> able income. Those means test arrangements have been in operation since 1983 and are uniformly applied.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the student support schemes, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course. Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from 1 October in the year preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>In the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate's reckonable income shall be that of the candidate and her or his spouse. Galway County Council, the body charged with administering the scheme in this case, has confirmed that it has not received an application from the candidate in question. The candidate should, therefore, contact Galway County Council with a view to having her eligibility for grant assistance assessed by reference to the terms and conditions of the higher education grant scheme relevant to the year of entry to her course.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 120 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 113 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and three mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. In addition, the school has the services of a shared learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>The agreement referred to above can only be deviated from when a school experiences rapid growth in its enrolment. Rapid growth is defined as an increase in its enrolment in one year relative to the previous year of 25 pupils. If in September the school authorities feel that they meet the rapid growth criteria they should make contact with officials of my Department.</P>

Both of these courses are run in the colleges of education which specialise in the training of primary teachers. The 18 month course is a full-time course run to enable third level graduates to train as primary teachers. The course was introduced as a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers. It was first provided in the 1995-96 academic year and has been repeated on a number of occasions since then. The most recent course commenced in February of this year. My Department is currently in consultation with the colleges of education about arrangements for a further 18 month course.

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 <Col N="702" /> with the 42 psychologists already employed in the service. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of a competition through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions, there are now 82 psychologists in NEPS and by the end of this school year there will be 100 psychologists in the service. I also intend to proceed with the recruitment of a further 28 psychologists before the end of this calendar year. This will raise the staffing to 128 and greatly improve the service.</P>
      <P>NEPS is assisted in its development by the National Policy Advisory Board on which parents and school authorities are represented along with other partners in education. In those schools where a psychological service is currently provided, it is the practice of NEPS to consult widely with school authorities, teachers and parents of individual children. I recognise there is a current need for other schools and parents to be able to gain access to psychological assessments pending the full development of the NEPS service. I recently announced the allocation of £1.25 million to NEPS for the purchase of assessments from private practitioners. The management of NEPS has developed an action plan for the implementation of this scheme. Guidelines on how to avail of the scheme will be issued to schools in the new school year.</P>
