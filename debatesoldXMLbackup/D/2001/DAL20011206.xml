      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Owen, Seán Ryan and Sargent. I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that the Dáil be suspended under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of immediate and urgent importance: the discovery of an illegal dump on 120 acres of land at Belcamp, County Dublin containing hospital and industrial waste and to hear a statement from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the actions he proposes arising from this discovery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the terms of Standing Order 31 I wish to give notice of my intention on the Order of Business to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention by the Minister: the <Col N="2" /> implications of the discovery of what is reported to be the biggest ever illegal dump containing hazardous waste at a site in Fingal in north Dublin and the need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to outline the measures being taken to protect the public and to make the site safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I request that Dáil Éireann be adjourned in accordance with Standing Order 31 to establish terms of reference for a full criminal investigation into the circumstances which created a massive 120 acre illegal hazardous waste dump in Fingal, north Dublin, dating back almost 20 years and to request that a complete reform of waste management law take place to ensure that hospital and other waste is minimised and treated by safe, modern, non-incineration technology as close to its source as possible, to end the out of sight, out of mind approach to this issue.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take No. 20, Motion <i>re</i> Appointment of chairperson of the Standards in Public Office Commission &ndash; returned from Committee; No. 21, Motion <i>re</i> Appointment of ordinary member of the Standards in Public Office Commission &ndash; returned from Committee; No. 22, Motion <i>re</i> Commencement of Paragraphs of the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001- returned from Committee; No. 47<i>b</i>, Motion <i>re</i> Referral to Joint Committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of a proposal under the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam (the proposal for a Council Directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities); No. 19<i>a</i>, Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance [2001] (Motion 6, resumed); No. 49, Extradition (European Union Conventions) Bill, 2001 &ndash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages, to be taken not later than 2.00 p.m. and to conclude at 3.00 p.m. if not previously concluded and the order shall resume thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that; (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted not later than 6.30 p.m.; (2) Nos. 20, 21, 22 and 47<i>b</i>, shall be decided without debate; (3) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the resumed debate on No. 19<i>a</i>: (i) the speech of the main spokespersons or a member nominated in his or her stead for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Taoiseach, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 40 minutes; (ii) the speech of each other member called upon shall not exceed 30 minutes; and (iii) members may share time; (4) the Report and Final Stages of No. 49 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.00 p.m. by one question, which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; (5) the Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and <Col N="4" /> shall adjourn not later than 4.30 p.m., there shall be no Order of Business (that is, within the meaning of Standing Order 26 (2) and (3)) and accordingly, the following business shall be transacted in the following order: No. 19<i>a</i>, Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance [2001] (Motion 6, resumed), to adjourn at 2.30 p.m. if not previously concluded and any division demanded thereon shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Tuesday 11 December 2001; and No. 50, Road Traffic Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed) and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 4.30 p.m. and any division demanded thereon shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Tuesday 11 December 2001; (6) the Dáil shall meet on Tuesday next at 11.30 a.m. and the following business shall be transacted up to Question Time; Sustainable Energy Bill, 2001 [Seanad] &ndash; Second Stage, to conclude at 2.30 p.m. if not previously concluded and any division demanded thereon shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business (in accordance with Standing Order 26) which shall take place at 4.15 p.m. on Tuesday, 11 December 2001.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are five proposals to be put to the House. Is the late sitting agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification from the Taoiseach. He may not be aware, but the order to which we are now being asked to give our assent is considerably long. It was only faxed to my Whip's office at 10.28 a.m. today. That is a deterioration in practice and I am making a formal complaint about it now. If the Government wants the compliance and co-operation of this side of the House we are entitled to a reasonable degree of advance notice.</P>
      <P>We will come to this issue separately and can decide then, but I am giving the Government time to consider it. It seems to me that one hour is hardly sufficient to debate an important Bill considering the controversies that surrounded the issue in this House and across the country on previous occasions. Is it necessary to adjourn the House at 6.30 p.m. today? Surely, if extra time is required we could give it today because we have other business tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now ordering part of business for next Tuesday because we are diverting from our normal practice and instead of coming in for Question Time at 2.30 p.m. next Tuesday we will come in at 11 a.m. Is the Taoiseach aware that we are being asked to give our assent to a raid on the social insurance fund next week in a Bill which presumably will be in our pigeon-holes on Saturday morning? There is a problem with it being there then as this building is locked on Saturday mornings. What arrangements are being made for us to see how we are being asked to comply in this post-legalised raid on the social insurance fund? Before this party gives its assent to this <Col N="5" /> measure it would like, at least, the courtesy from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs that the relevant Opposition spokespersons would be given copies of the legislation today. We are not happy with the contents of the Bill but we should at least be informed in sufficient time so we can voice our criticism in a constructive way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn has asked three questions. I apologise for the late issuing of the Order of Business. I understand it was because the Whips had a long and late meeting last night.</P>
      <P>I am not sure how much time the Deputy is requesting on the Extradition (European Union Conventions) Bill, 2001. The Deputy can take that issue up with the Whips. We will be here if it is necessary. I understand it has been fairly well debated although I have not taken part in that debate. The question of time can be looked at. On the third issue, the Minister assures me that it is a short Bill and he can give it today. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the late sitting agreed to? Agreed.</P>
      <P>The next proposal is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 20, 21, 22 and 47<i>b</i>. That is the motion re. Standards in Public Office Commission and the Referral to Joint Committee of the Fourth Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam. Is that agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask a question on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A Deputy is only entitled to speak on it if he or she opposes the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we agree it, will the Taoiseach say, before the committee gets a chance to discuss this, whether any announcements will be made about the situation of foreign workers coming into this country? I understand the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment intends making changes concerning foreign workers coming here for paid employment. It is important that we have full knowledge before this matter is referred to the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being sent to the committee for discussion. If the Tánaiste makes any announcement I am sure the committee will be made aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal agreed to? Agreed.</P>
      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 19<i>a</i>&ndash; the resumed budget debate agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>May I have clarification on that? The Order of Business states that Members may share time. Does that only refer to the speech of each other Member?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Is it agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="6" /> Is the proposal for dealing with No. 49 &ndash; the conclusion of Report and Final Stages of the Extradition (European Union Conventions) Bill, 2001 &ndash; agreed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has indicated that he might withdraw that proposal and I hope he will. On Committee Stage a number of amendments were not proceeded with until the Minister of State who handled the Bill took further advice. Some of the amendments in my name have been tabled again now as Government amendments. Another amendment, circulated last night, would fundamentally alter the nature of an appeal of an extradition warrant from the High Court to the Supreme Court to allow it to be considered only on a point of law. That was only circulated last night. As there are important serious matters about the rights of Irish citizens to avoid extradition except in careful areas of scrutiny I ask that this proposal be withdrawn to allow Report Stage take its course. Then all the amendments could be fully debated and discussed and I do not think it would take that long. The matter of extradition is of such importance that we should not guillotine it through in an hour. In the spirit of the Taoiseach's comments earlier to Deputy Quinn, I ask that this proposal be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to finish this Bill today. As Deputy Quinn pointed out, we can sit later this evening if that is necessary. If we can agree the order as it is, then the Whips can meet and agree to add time today. In principle I am in favour of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It will take more than an hour. The order says it will start at 2 p.m. and finish at 3 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said it would not take very long. What are we talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how long. It depends on the attitude of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whips will work that out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot, because it depends on the attitude of the Minister. Will the Minister force issues? Certainly, two hours would be more appropriate than one hour but whether we can even arrange them all in two hours, I do not know. I ask that the guillotine be removed. We will deal with it expeditiously and will conclude it, but we should allow as much time as is required to deal with the difficult issues, some of which were only brought to our attention last night when the Report Stage amendments were circulated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the order to stay as it is but I agree in principle that the Whips may meet and agree the extra time. I will not allocate a time. The Whips can agree the time and then it <Col N="7" /> can be added on this evening and the Government Whip can come in and move the order. I think that is reasonable.</P>
      <P>Question: &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. 49 be agreed to&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The next proposal is that for the sitting and business of the Dáil tomorrow. Is it agreed to? Agreed.</P>
      <P>The final proposal. Is the proposal for the sitting and business of the Dáil up to Question Time next Tuesday agreed to?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>This is not agreed to. The order is that the Sustainable Energy Bill is to be guillotined. Now the Order of Business is scheduled for 11.30 a.m. and the Bill itself is to be guillotined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>Yes, the commencement of Dáil business is at 11.30 a.m. and the Bill is to be guillotined at 2.30 p.m. That is less than three hours of debate for the Second Stage of a Bill. Apart from the principle that Second Stage debates should not be restricted &ndash; a fundamental principle &ndash; this is an extremely important debate. It is about energy policy and general energy matters. What is the rush with this and why is it being jack-booted through the Dáil? It is totally unacceptable to this side of the House that the time allowed will only allow five or six speakers to speak.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <P>On Friday's business?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can accommodate that in my thinking but I hope when I raise the matter that people will see that it might have deteriorated by Tuesday. Yesterday on the Order of Business I raised the issue of the provision of time to discuss the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. I understand time has been offered for next week. I want the Taoiseach to reconsider the offer that has been made &ndash; that a set of ten minute statements be made. I ask the Taoiseach, if not this morning then over the weekend, to consider the appropriateness of a question and answer session with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the matter. A set of ten minute statements is not the appropriate way to handle a matter which the Taoiseach has already agreed is urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I tried to fit it in tomorrow, as the Deputy knows, is that the Mini<Col N="8" /> ster was not available, but there was a lengthy Committee Stage on this at which the Minister spoke. It is an evolving situation and we will have the debate next week.</P>
      <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for the setting of business for the Dáil next Tuesday be agreed to&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard the Taoiseach on the 9 o'clock news last night claiming that there is an increase of £1 billion provided for in the Health Estimate. Would he clarify these remarks since the Minister, in his statement, said that there was an additional 425 million but subsequently acknowledged in the details of the budget that 170 million of this was to cover costs incurred this year, leaving an increase of only 255 million? This is an increase of 4.7%, exactly the rate of inflation. Did the Taoiseach deliberately mislead the people on television or will he admit now that he made a mistake? Will he also acknowledge that this is the lowest increase in health expenditure in the past ten years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of what Deputy Jim Mitchell said, will the Taoiseach, either now or later this morning during the budget debate, accept my colleague Deputy McDowell's excellent analysis of the budget that out of the entire ten year health strategy, which it is estimated will cost 15,000 million, this year's commitment amounts to about 2%? Does the Government seriously expect 98% of the health strategy to be financed by successive Administrations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said yesterday and in recent days in many interviews, between the Estimates and yesterday's provisions, there is over £1 billion available for health. It is an enormous contribution on which I know Deputy Jim Mitchell will congratulate the Minister when he speaks later today. The strategy of the Minister for Health and Children, built on his own work and that of Deputy Cowen, will continue to improve the health service. I invite the House to listen to Deputy Martin's statement when he speaks as the improvements he is introducing to the health service will be of interest to all our constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are misleading the House. The facts speak for themselves. In the Budget Statement, the Minister stated &ldquo;Today I am allocating additional Exchequer funding of 425 million.&rdquo;. Later, he acknowledged that provision has been made for necessary adjustments associated with the emerging out-turn of the Health and Children Vote in 2001 which will cost 170 million in 2002. If we subtract that from the increase, we get an <Col N="9" /> increase of 255 million or 4.7% &ndash; the rate of ordinary inflation, not even medical inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite my good friend, Deputy Jim Mitchell, to join me in congratulating the Minister for Health and Children on his success, between the Supplementary Estimate and the budget, in achieving £1 billion for the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the nervous applause from that side of the House. I would applaud too.</P>
      <P>The imminent decision by Iarnród Éireann to transfer approximately 46% of its freight traffic from rail to road has been raised before in the House. The Taoiseach must know that only 10% of our freight is transported by rail while the rest is transported on the worst road infrastructure in Europe. If it proceeds, this decision will put an extra 5% onto an already overburdened infrastructure. A letter was sent on 3 December to the Minister for Public Enterprise drawing her attention to this fact. On previous occasions, the Taoiseach was unable to confirm or deny if this decision would be taken, but I am sure that his excellent back-up staff have informed him of the current position. Will he indicate whether Iarnród Éireann will proceed, because finances have not been allocated by this bankrupt Government&mdash;</P>

As I said before I was interrupted by the Minister for Public Enterprise, the Minister for static trams, will the Taoiseach, in light of the advance notice he received, indicate to the House the position of Iarnród Éireann? Has a decision been made by its board, and has it been accepted by the Government on behalf of the stakeholders?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The factual position is that Iarnród Éireann discussed this matter on which it received proposals. The Minister informed the company, following the correspondence referred to by Deputy Quinn, that she does not support its pulling out of rail freight or substantially reducing its contribution in this area as, among other reasons, it would add more heavy traffic to the streets, as most of this work occurs at its Spencer Dock site. Developments are due to begin at that site but no decision has yet been made, although the Minister does not think it advisable to reduce rail freight traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it from what the Taoiseach has said that the Government is opposed to a policy option before the board? That option is there because Iarnród Éireann does not have the resources to continue to carry that level of freight. That is our information. Will the board be instructed by the Government not to proceed with that particular policy option?</P>

In order to facilitate rational discussion, I wish to ask two questions. When will the text of <Col N="12" /> the motion to be agreed be available to the Opposition and how will it be communicated to us? In terms of taking what is, again, a very sensitive issue &ndash; not dissimilar to the one we discussed in relation to extradition &ndash; will adequate time be provided next week for a full debate?

The proposal forms an integral part of a concerted European response to the threats posed by international terrorism and organised crime.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This kind of event seems to occur very frequently after Fianna Fáil leaves Government. It happened in June 1981 when the budget of that year was seriously awry and the then newly appointed Minister, Deputy John Bruton, had to take immediate and fairly vigorous measures to get things back on track. It happened again in December 1982 when I came into that office. Deputy Quinn will recall discussions we had at that time. It was a difficult business to begin to remedy the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government of 1982 with a plan notoriously called &ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo;, which turned out to be its downfall, had got things so badly out of line that it was immediately necessary to start from scratch in order to try to get things back into some kind of order again. My belief is that the budget presented to the House yesterday will unravel quickly. We should not be surprised because we can see that the budget policy for 2001 ended in tatters. I checked the figures last night and found the following benign presentation of the situation.</P>
      <P>At budget time last year net current expenditure for the year was forecast to be 23.3 billion. The outturn revealed to us yesterday was 24.3 billion. Total current receipts at budget time last year were forecast at 31.1 billion. The outturn communicated to us yesterday was 28.7 billion. That must be the first time in a long time that the outturn of receipts was less than the forecast made at budget time. I note that seems to have got through to the Government this year because to the best of my recollection I did not hear the word &ldquo;buoyancy&rdquo; used once during the preparation of the budget for next year. We all remember buoyancy was the favourite ploy of Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance. When they could not make the two ends of the budget meet, they looked up their Roget's thesaurus and found buoyancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy have to go that far to get it? We used to create it; we did not have to look it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Buoyancy would sort out all their problems. We have not seen buoyancy in revenue in the past year, but revenue sinking below expectations for the first time in my 20 years as a Member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current budget surplus for 2001 was forecast on budget day last year to be 7.8 billion. The figure revealed to us yesterday was just under 4.5 billion, an undershoot of 3.3 billion. That shows how much and how far the budgetary arithmetic for 2001 had unravelled in relation to expenditure and revenue. The capital budget balance forecast of 4.6 billion turned out to be just under 4.2 billion. That reflects the fact that many of the undertakings and commitments made by the Government in the national development plan are grossly over-optimistic and that the management systems are not in place to ensure the plan happens as intended. There has <Col N="19" /> been an undershoot of 400 million on expenditure on the national development plan and on the capital side of the budget generally. The result is that for 2001 the Exchequer surplus, which had been forecast at 3.2 billion at budget time, finally turned out to be 334 million. The Exchequer surplus for the year will turn out to be barely over one tenth of what was forecast at budget time and 2.9 billion below the Government's budget forecast. That is a dramatic unravelling of a budget. The general Government surplus at budget time last year was forecast at just under 5 billion. It turned out at less than one third of that, 1.6 billion, an undershoot of 3.3 billion.</P>
    <P>By the middle of 2001 it was clear the Minister for Finance had lost control of the public finances. Expenditure was running ahead of budget figures, while expenditure in the second half of the year accelerated to a greater rate. Revenue was running at considerably below the budget figures. In the first half of the year it trailed substantially behind the forecasts and in the second half of the year the situation deteriorated further. It is important to highlight this because, as Deputy Jim Mitchell said last night, the Taoiseach in recent days has tried to pin the blame for the deteriorating fiscal situation on external factors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolute nonsense. The deterioration in the budget arithmetic happened long before the events of 11 September and the establishment of a recession in the American economy and its affect on our trading partners in Europe. The Minister for Finance lost control of fiscal policy in the early part of last year. He was not able to contain expenditure within the limits he had set at the beginning of the year and grossly overestimated the type of revenue that would be forthcoming from the level of economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not surprised that is the case because there is a Fianna Fáil syndrome. We saw it with former Ministers for Finance, such as Gene Fitzgerald who presided over the most spectacular unravelling of budget policy. We saw it again in 1982 and during the tenures in that office of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and a former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds. Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance are notoriously unable to keep control of fiscal policy because they do not have the bottle to present realistic forecasts of expenditure and income or withstand the pressure from their colleagues to go outside the boundaries of agreed expenditure. The only case where I see the beginning of that type of discipline being imposed is in the way the current Minister for Finance treats the hapless Minister for Health and Children. He allowed him to go to Ballymascanlon and announce the beginning of a new health strategy, but smacked him in the face by saying there was no money. He then tor<Col N="20" /> tured him for the next few months before another health strategy document was published, which was severely criticised by the Department of Finance. The allocation for next year barely allows the Government to put its toe in the water in terms of beginning to implement the health strategy, to which I will return.</P>
    <P>We saw during 2001 a major unravelling and complete degradation of the budget arithmetic presented to us on budget day last year. As Deputy Jim Mitchell said last night, the Minister for Finance turned wine into water in 2001, a miraculous transformation. The Government started off with the most comfortable fiscal position, but found itself facing a major abyss by the end of the year. The Minister for Finance forecasts an Exchequer surplus of 170 million for 2002. I do not believe that figure is real. It was included to allow the Minister for Finance to idly boast yesterday that he would not borrow. He will not borrow, but steal. I have no doubt that by this time next year that 170 million, which is only a token when one looks at the total budgetary masses involved, will have evaporated and we will not be looking at an Exchequer surplus when we look back on 2002. If we are looking at it, it will be because another Minister for Finance has managed to pull the situation around because I do not see how it will improve or hold during the rest of the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>That Exchequer surplus of 170 million comes from a forecast increase of 10.6% in current expenditure, a 12.7% increase in total current receipts and a deterioration of 30% in the capital budget balance. Those figures will not hold up. That modest surplus of 170 million is arrived at through a series of funny money operations. That is the only way to describe them. The first funny-money operation is the raiding of the social insurance fund for 635 million and the second is the raiding of the Central Bank in two ways for a once-off injection of 610 million, of which 240 million will come from the contingency fund the Central Bank has for its note issue liabilities and 370 million from seigniorage, the profit taken from the minting of coins. I never thought I would see this in a Budget Statement because even officials in the Department of Finance and the Central Bank hesitate to use that money. The third funny money operation is a raid on the capital services redemption fund, for the second year running, to the tune of 500 million. That might be legitimate one year, but when it happens for a second I begin to worry.</P>
    <P>A fourth funny money operation is the hijacking of 792 million of corporation profits tax income from 2003 to 2002, on a once-off basis. Its presentation in the budget document is very slick. It is presented as 792 million revenue for 2002. Some 29 million is shown for 2003, giving a total of 821 million. The casual observer would think there is a bonus of over 800 million in 2003, but there is not. There will actually be 29 million in <Col N="21" /> 2003, reflecting the very temporary nature of the benefit we will get from this action.</P>

      <P>The social insurance fund is in place for a very specific purpose, of which Deputy McDowell dealt with some aspects very clearly last night, on which I heard him expand this morning. Conversations I have had since yesterday afternoon reveal that a great many understand what is going on. One person told me she feels afraid when she sees what is being done with the social insurance fund which is in place specifically to provide a safety net and improve the level of social benefits for those in need. We face a downturn in economic activity and in the last couple of months have seen a succession of firms closing down or reducing their numbers of staff. There are a lot of redundancies coming. It gives none of us joy to see this, in fact, it causes us a great deal of worry. The social insurance fund is in place in order that we can deal with the fall-out from such circumstances as they arise, but there is even more to it than that. It provides a series of benefits, some of which are addressed in the budget, designed to assist people when they are particularly vulnerable, when they have lost their jobs or have other difficulties. It is in place to improve their social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>The budget contains very modest provisions for increases in social welfare benefits. This morning, we heard from the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, say that taking money from the social inclusion fund is the same as giving the people back their money. That may be, but it is not giving it back to them for the purposes they paid into the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not being given back to those who paid in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not being given back to those who gave it in the first place and not necessarily to those who need it. Raiding the social insurance fund for the purpose of supporting general expenditure is a con job. It is a funny money operation which I hope will not become a standard element of Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats fiscal management. I hope that statement does not become too relevant in the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has asked the reason we should borrow money when we have money in accounts. That is a fair question, but I ask him if it makes sense to raid the social insurance fund for 635 million in a year he is putting the equivalent of 1% of GDP into a pensions fund. That is a provision we all support. However, I remind the Minister that when he brought forward the legislation to provide for the fund we proposed to him that he not indissolubly wed himself to the provision to it of 1% of GDP every year. We sug<Col N="22" /> gested he give himself a margin of between 0.5% and 1.5% of GDP, precisely to cope with the kind of circumstances in which he now finds himself. He is being disingenuous and trying to conceal things from us when he asks, in his brash and apparently commonsensical and down to earth way, the reason he should borrow money when there is money lying in accounts. When he speaks like that he is trying to put something across on one. Why should he be putting so much money into a pension fund when he is at the same time raiding the social insurance fund?</P>
    <P>There may well be a case for adopting the practice of other EU member states in relation to Central Bank surplus funds, whereby the profit made from seigniorage is allocated to the Exchequer. The Minister is going to bring legislation before the House to legitimise that process. In this case he proposes to include as a substantial part of his budget moneys totalling 370 million to which, strictly speaking, he does not have a right to and to take credit for doing so. He does the same thing elsewhere. That is odd and on that count the budget is vulnerable. He is also taking part of the Central Bank's surplus income worth 240 million, which is part of a reserve the bank keeps because it incurs liabilities when it issues bank notes. Over a period of time the bank has decided that there is a certain degree of risk for which it can provide, but the Minister has decided it will not need that provision and that he will take it. It may well be that he is right and the bank will not have to ask him for some of the money back because its expectations were unfounded.</P>
    <P>I do not know how vulnerable the Central bank is, but find it odd that this is being done for the very first time in history in the year we are to begin using a new currency. We convert to the euro on 1 January and I am not sure anybody in the bank would claim that the level of realisation of this contingent liability will not change. We should remember that we will participate in a new currency which will be common to 12 states. It is not just our experience of what Irish people do with their bank notes which will count, it will also be the experience of what they do with them at home and abroad and the experience of what the citizens of 11 other states do with their bank notes when they are at home and abroad. The Minister has blithely ignored that the position will change. One part of the raid he has made on the Central Bank is vulnerable. There is a risk attached to it just as there is a risk attached to the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister is raiding the capital services redemption fund for the second year running to the tune of 500 million, about the same he took from it last year. Between these two years the capital services redemption fund will have been reduced by 1 billion, this at a time when the Minister's budget forecast indicates we will have substantial Government deficits in 2003 and 2004. What do these substantial deficits in 2003 and 2004 mean for the future of the capital services <Col N="23" /> redemption fund? Will we need to call on it in 2003 and 2004 for the purpose for which it was established? Will a future Minister for Finance find himself or herself in the position analogous to that of Mother Hubbard who went to the cupboard and found it was bare? What are the implications for the future? There is a policy risk attached to raiding the capital services redemption fund for the second year running.</P>
    <P>Then there is the corporation profits tax change which will not gladden the hearts of corporate Ireland. There is a once-off gain of 792 million which will not be available to the Minister for Finance next year or the following year. There will be 29 million for the Minister the following year. Next year is a once-off. Once that is done, the benefit is gone&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fragility of the exercise is neatly illustrated by the Minister's projection of an overall Exchequer deficit of 3 billion in 2003 and 3.7 billion in 2004. That is on the basis, I gather, of a no policy change forecast. The Minister is saying his budgetary and fiscal policy this year is creating not just the risk, but the certainty of very large deficits in the next two years and the need to go back to increased borrowing&mdash;</P>

He does not say anywhere in the body of the statement what his inflation forecast is for 2002. He says it will be on an upward trend and expects it to reduce in 2004.

      <P>An examination of the robustness of the expenditure and revenue forecasts gives us a great deal more cause for concern. There will be continued pressure during 2002 for more expenditure on health. Deputy Jim Mitchell pointed out that, taking away the sleight of hand and the reflections in mirrors which were part of the health presentation, there is about 220 million in the projected expenditure for 2002 which can be allocated to the collapsed health strategy. The strategy will cost 10 billion over ten years, 1 billion a year. In its first year we find 225 million allocated for new actions. I do not know how far that amount of money will go to getting us the 450 public hospital beds we heard about yesterday&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;or how far it will go to getting the extra nurses we will need. What I do know is that there will be pressure. For example, last night during the course of a radio programme, I pointed out in the presence of the Minister of State that, this year for the first year I can remember, there is no provision for the ordinary indexation of medical card income guidelines. Even in years when no specific provision was made, the income guidelines were indexed in order that Members could usually tell concerned constituents in the autumn that, after a review in the new year, they would probably qualify for a medical card if they were just above the income guidelines at the time of speaking. That will not happen this year. Those just above the income level in recent months do not have any chance of becoming eligible for a medical card by the working of indexation. Apart from that, some people will receive an indexed increase for a relatively modest income level and will thus leave the medical card scheme more quickly in 2002 than ever before. I came across an example of the kind of pressure to come when listening to the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, on radio last night. He said, &ldquo;Ah well, that's only for now. We don't know what might happen after the beginning of the year&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>People who get the idea that they can walk on water usually come to a fairly sticky end. Unfortunately, the bottom of the canal at the sixth lock is pretty muddy.</P>
      <P>The capital budget balance this year is set to deteriorate by 30%. I wonder what that means for the national development plan. If we are witnessing that much reduction in the capital budget balance, how much of it can hold up this year? This is happening at a time when construction industry inflation is running at higher levels than general inflation. That presages a substantial slowdown in the rate of work on national development plan projects. I forecast that by the middle of 2002, substantial parts of the national development plan will be very much behind schedule.</P>
      <P>Just the other day I happened to be speaking to NRA engineers about one road project which is at the planning stage. So far they are on target but by mid-2002 money for the design operation will begin to dry up because it will be necessary to divert the greater part of the money to projects that are in the course of construction. I am sure that will happen to the roads programme and we will see echoes of that pattern affecting other parts of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>There are worries about the vulnerability of a major fisheries development in Killybegs and I can see other areas where hesitation will arise over how much of the plan will be implemented. There are a series of inconsistencies in this year's budget policy. The VAT increase from 20% to 21% smacks of last minute desperation because they could not think of anything else to tie up the loose ends. It is a very unwise move. If there ever was a good time to increase tax, which there never is, this is certainly not a good time to increase VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to see that interest relief on rented residential property is being restored and that stamp duty rates for investors have been reduced. That will add some supply to the rented accommodation market, which is required. Yesterday we had another one of these asinine press <Col N="27" /> releases from the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, about the latest house price trends. He is rejoicing in the fact that the rate of increase in house prices is going down. It is like being happy that the starship &ldquo;house-prices&rdquo; has now slowed from warp speed to merely supersonic. It just means that houses are getting beyond the reach of ordinary people at a slightly less inter-stellar rate than before. Nothing in these figures will give anybody more confidence to buy a house now as opposed to doing so three months ago. I am glad, however, to see measures being taken that will bring back some supply to the rented residential property market. People who are purporting to speak on behalf of tenants of such properties, and who are criticising these measures, are entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see a reduction in the top rate of the employers' PRSI contribution but it is hardly consistent with the removal of the cap last year. The Government does not seem to have any settled policy in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget to deal with the situation facing young farmers. I hope we will be able to return to these issues in the Finance Bill. There is nothing in the budget to improve the situation of third level students who are living away from home on meagre grants. There is no expenditure proposal to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>I was astonished to discover that the Taoiseach has gone back on what was understood to be a binding guarantee to provide £1.8 million for the Irish Seal Sanctuary which will now have to close. I have lobbied the Taoiseach and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for months about that. The Minister, Deputy de Valera, says it is not her business because it does not involve conservation, but the Taoiseach apparently gave an undertaking that funding would be provided for the sanctuary.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the budget arithmetic for 115 million for benchmarking. I know the Government does not want to reveal its hand on this matter but how many public servants will get any kind of increase from this sum? That financial provision is seriously at risk of being grossly exceeded.</P>
    <P>I can see this budget unravelling and by the time we get to the election it will be off the rails. The next Government will have to undertake a major operation to re-establish fiscal common sense.</P>

      <P>In his Budget Statement yesterday, dealing with the topic of borrowing and investing, the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2002 I will not be borrowing. I am budgeting for an Exchequer surplus and a general Government surplus. My views on the imprudence of Exchequer borrowing are well known and of long standing. We got ourselves into a mire by borrowing for current purposes in the past. The legacy hung around our necks for <Col N="28" /> more than 20 years. I am not going to repeat the mistakes of the past.</P>
    <P>I note the reference to current borrowing. Later on, the same Budget Statement deals with a set of projections required under our membership of the European Union. The EU stability programme concealed the duplicity of Mr. Haughey's budgets but prises open the stark reality of this budget. When one looks at the Exchequer balance to which the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, was referring, the estimated outturn for this year is 334 million, and it is 170 million for 2002. The estimated outturn for 2003, however, is minus 2,980 million and, as if that were not enough, it is minus 3,682 million for 2004. The Minister for Finance, arrogantly and proudly &ndash; it is hard to separate one from the other &ndash; stated yesterday, &ldquo;judge me on my first five chapters of the book&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>It will be a best seller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister won the Booker Prize for fiction. Sometimes it is better not to make unsustainable claims about what he has done. To stand up yesterday as the Minister did and make a speech about sound finances merely invited scorn. Judging from this morning's newspapers, scorn is what the Minster has received. It is the inevitable fate of a man who believes his own press releases. I will return later to read into the record a sample of the quotations of objective observers rather than political participants.</P>
      <P>If the Minister really believed what he said yesterday about borrowing, we would be looking at a totally different budget. If yesterday's budget says anything, it is that the Minister knows he has delivered his last hurrah as Minister for Finance. He cooked the books. He may not have to deal with the harsh reality of a deficit but he has made certain that his successor will.</P>
      <P>Some 3 billion for 2003 and 3.7 billion for 2004, based on no policy change, represent stark deficits by anybody's language. There will be no general Government surpluses in those years but clearly the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, hopes that problems will not be attributed to him. The contrast between his legacy and the situation he inherited could not be greater. He advocates that, to maintain the integrity of a fund established by him to look after pension requirements until 2025, we should borrow on a year in year out basis from next year to put money away in this fund. It is nonsense and it is time those who have supported this nonsense came out and admitted it. Although I see from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of a couple of weeks ago that fewer and fewer economists are prepared to subscribe to this lunacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministers downfall has been his dishonesty. Had he had the courage to stand up yesterday and declare that the requirements of the national development plan and our future economic growth required sensible deficit financing, <Col N="29" /> he would have been lauded. One Sunday newspaper said as much last weekend. My party's position has been for some time that borrowing is justifiable for the purposes of capital investment in order to improve the capacity of the economy to grow. The Minister's previous rhetoric and his own puffed up sense of importance made this impossible. Instead he chose to spin the unspinnable story and it has landed flat back in his face.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks the Labour Party intends to stand here and see the social insurance fund raided for this indulgence he can think again. There is a long way to go to Christmas and I can guarantee each and every Fianna Fáil backbencher that yesterday, the Minister made it longer. Deputy McDowell is right. What the Minster announced yesterday in respect of the social insurance fund is illegal. By agreeing that it needs to change the law before proceeding, the Government is accepting the analysis put forward by Deputy McDowell yesterday.</P>
    <P>It is also an act of not inconsiderable hypocrisy on the part of the Minster who complained in the past about the payment of the equality social welfare arrears out of the fund. Those payments, which totalled no more than £50 million, 63.50 million, were described by this Minister in 1995 as a raid on the fund. If that is the case, what else can you describe dipping into the fund, a fund paid for by workers and employers, to the tune of ten times that amount? There is no doubt either on the Government side that this is a new and unprecedented raid. The Attorney General, Micheal McDowell, ranted about the social insurance fund, also in relation to the 1995 budget. He accepted that the fund constituted a hypothecated tax, namely a tax that must be spent for the purposes for which it was raised. There is no doubt that digging the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, out of a hole is not one of the hypothecated uses for the fund as set out in the 1993 Social Welfare Consolidation Act.</P>
    <P>What about the review and operation of the social insurance fund board conducted in accordance with the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness with the social partners? Were they consulted on this matter? Perhaps the Taoiseach will elaborate on that point when he responds. Was the hapless Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs consulted on the issue at all? What possible strategies is he to examine in relation to a denuded fund now? In July last he told Deputy Jan O'Sullivan that a review was necessary &ldquo;in order to ensure that they are used to best advantage having regard to emerging demands and overall interest of its contributors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Minister for Finance could not give tuppence for the concerns of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, about the &ldquo;overall interest of its contributors&rdquo;. Why is it that this Minister, the man who clambers around trees in North Dublin, is so badly treated by a Government that cares not for his dignity or his talents? <Col N="30" /> It is not as if the fund could not have been used in the manner for which it was intended. Last Sunday at the launch of my party's pre-budget statement, we called for a £20 or 26 increase in the old age pension. That we believed would be a reasonable step towards benchmarking this critical payment at 34% of average earnings. It would not have gone the whole way, but it would have been a start and a good one at that. What we got instead was 12.7 and the path of pensioners into continued relative poverty was firmly set out by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The other purpose for which the social insurance fund can be used is in accordance with the redundancy payments acts. In the present context, workers who were the unfortunate enough to lose their jobs in the current downturn, with minimal skills could have had their statutory entitlements increased. The Labour Party will bring forward legislation to that effect. If such entitlements were increased, combined with training allowances, they would have a cushion and a possibility to retrain while maintaining a decent level of income support so that they could return to the labour market with enhanced skills and take up the slack already there. This was not to be. We have had five chapters, five years, five awful years, five wasted years.</P>
    <P>It is hard to think of it now but when looks at the figures they are quite stark. During those years, we have spent 4.8 billion on income tax and PRSI reductions. It is an unprecedented amount of money and the Minister sought to make much play of it yesterday. The Taoiseach will no doubt seek to do likewise this morning. We will hear tall tales of this Government's achievements and comparisons with years gone by and other administrations. It amounts to saying no more than the 20th century was better than the 19th century and that the 21st century will be better than the last. Things progress, even the inflation which this Government has stoked in its time, exaggerates the claims this Government makes about its own performance &ndash; figures are up, in part, because money has been devalued. I ask the Taoiseach not to give us that nonsense this morning. I know it is nonsense and so does he. If he wants to go into people's past records as Minister for Finance he should look at his own as well as others.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired of the Government regaling us with stories about how much more than the Rainbow Government it has spent in certain areas. As Minister for Finance in that Government I remember been subjected to barrages of abuse about being a &ldquo;tax and spend&rdquo; Minister, particularly from the current Minister for Finance and the current Attorney General. They wanted me to spend less money on social services, not more. They complained about the deficits we ran, they did not request that those deficits be higher. If they were as honest then about the macro-economic climate as my party has been in recent weeks, public debate would be all the better for it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> If the Minister and the Government insist on looking at the choices they have made then let us return to his home ground issue &ndash; taxation. The Minster was at great pains to suggest that his tax reductions have been progressive. It is abject nonsense. On the Minister's own figure 33% of the money spent on tax reductions over the past four years went exclusively to those on the upper income bracket. It sounds good, does it not? The Minister of State might even buy it. The reality is that 67% of the people, the least well off in our society, were excluded from that largesse. They did not benefit by one penny from it, but the lucky 33% benefited from the reminder of money spent on taxation. They shared in the benefits that accrued to the other 67% arising from the reductions in the standard tax rate and benefited from increases in the allowances.</P>
    <P>Trick-o-the-loop economics and playing around with the figures was what we got yesterday. I am surprised the Minister sought to make a point of this yesterday. He may not like it but on this one the commentators are right. As Minister for Finance, he has created categories of taxpayers, deserving taxpayers and non-deserving taxpayers. For him and his political colleague and soul mate, the Tánaiste, high flyers and the well off are the most deserving recipients of the largesse he has distributed as Minister. They are also the people who probably benefited most from the reductions in capital gains tax and the latest schemes on capital acquisitions tax announced by him in this budget and in the previous one. These are the winners. The losers are those on low pay, on the minimum wage who, after seeing almost 5 billion spent on tax reductions in the past five years, still have almost 50 of their incomes subject to tax as a result of this budget.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Finance, always capable of a <i>coup de grace</i>, crowned it all by reducing business taxation by more than the reductions in tax on personal incomes for workers. The reality is that yesterday's budget is about the future, but in the eyes of this Government the future extends no further than the next six months.</P>
    <P>The increase in indirect taxation, particularly in the form of a 1% VAT rise, will also disproportionately affect the least well off in our society. On this point, the Minister stretched the bounds of logic to its limits. He told us &ndash; this was straight out of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>&ndash; he was reversing last year's 1% reduction, introduced as a result of his loss of control over inflation, because it had not been passed on to consumers. If that is his view, does he accept that it follows a further increase will this time be passed on to consumers and that the kindest interpretation of his intervention in this area in the past two years has been to push prices up by 1%, not to mention the cover he has given to anybody who might decide to use this increase as a further excuse to push up prices during the sensitive, complicated euro changeover period?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> If there has been an economic consensus about how to react to the economic difficulties of the past six months, it has been that continued investment in the structural deficiencies of the Irish economy could not be sacrificed. It is fair to say we have all known for quite some time that the economy could not continue to grow at the pace it has grown in the past few years. We knew the slow down would inevitably come, that the economy has been skirting close to its productive limits, and that only so much economic activity can take place in a city like Dublin where traffic grinds to a halt on a regular basis. We also know an economy cannot continue to grow rapidly when it is close to full employment and that it is possible to move only so much freight on the worst railways and roads in Europe. We know that only so many workers can be employed when there is not enough housing, when the health system cannot look after them and when there is not affordable and decent child care places.</P>
    <P>At the heart of our current economic problems is the fact that we are experiencing an external and a domestic economic shock. Perhaps there is not much we can do about the former, but if we fail to address our domestic constraints we will never make full use of our economic potential. It is a poor and selfish Government that cannot even support the national interest to jump this basic hurdle just because the Minister made his career talking tough on the economy more than 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Yesterday our worst fears were confirmed. A poor, ill conceived and limited national development plan was slow tracked officially by the Minster. If the Estimates day was bad, budget day was worse.</P>
    <P>More spectacularly, whatever hopes we held out for a health strategy &ndash; announced at great expense by a Government within the past fortnight &ndash; have died completely. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is now the emperor with no clothes; there was a lot of hype but very little substance. As my colleague, Deputy McDowell, amply demonstrated yesterday, the National Health Strategy is a work of fiction. The Government is so inept that it set out a series of targets for itself over a ten year period and comprehensively failed to make an impact on those targets within ten days. That is a question only the Taoiseach can answer. Why lend one's name to a strategy that the Finance Minister has designated for scuttling? Why raise the hopes of a nation about something that one has no intention of fulfilling. Why say one will spend 11 billion on capital investment in health over ten years when one's investment goes no further than 200 million? Those who need medical cards are not the only losers this week. Those of us who had hoped for a decent and fair health system have also lost out badly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach to think seriously about the hypocrisy involved, not so much on the part of the Minister, but on the part of the Government as a whole. Having jumped through every hoop <Col N="33" /> possible to return a budget surplus this year, the Government has failed to deliver on its health strategy. It wants somebody else to do it. The Government that will succeed it and inherit a 3 billion deficit from the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is expected to try to implement it.</P>
    <P>Make no mistake about it, the remaining signs of life were strangled out of the health strategy yesterday and the political career of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, should go with it, but perhaps that would not upset the Taoiseach too much. Few politicians would lend their names to such a cynical exercise. That the Minister, Deputy Martin, should also be centre stage on a divisive and ill conceived referendum that may never happen makes him the fall guy of, to use a well known quote, &ldquo;the most cunning and devious of them all&rdquo;. There is no fear from Cork.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, the health strategy is not the only loser. Thankfully, social housing got a shot in the arm yesterday but not near enough to fulfil the commitments made in the PPF, as the Taoiseach acknowledged earlier this week during Question Time. The shambolic state of school buildings up and down the country, as described by the INTO, also seems set to continue. The roads programme will make no great recovery either from the assault waged on it on budget day.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Government lived up to its commitment on child benefit. We have gone some considerable way in the past ten years to tackle child poverty and the Government, at least in the past two years, has played its part, for which I unreservedly salute it. However, it is fraudulent to say that tackling child poverty amounts to tackling the issue of child care which remains a capacity constraint and an upward pressure on wages in our economy.</P>
    <P>As I have said previously, part of this problem relates to supply side control. It is about the co-ordination of places in the right place and at the right time. Extraordinarily, the Government's response has been to deal with this problem within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As an aside, in years to come when somebody compiles a lexicon of the greatest Irish oxymorons of all time, the author in respect of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will win the Booker Prize. There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>Child care is something the bombastic Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does when he takes a break from bullying refugees. In reality it never gets done, and its consequent drag-down effect on our economy has continued over the past four years because nobody is responsible for solving the problem of child care. One only has to look at the draw-down in the capital figures to see the accuracy of that analysis.</P>
    <P>While I have commended the Government for its efforts to tackle child poverty, its efforts to tackle poverty as a whole have been lamentable. The gap between rich and poor has grown massively in the lifetime of this Government, the one <Col N="34" /> Government with the time and the resources to address the issue. Why has the Taoiseach not accepted, as I have done, the need to benchmark our social welfare payments with earnings? Is he at all serious about the issue of relative poverty? Yesterday, rather than use the money in the social insurance fund for what it was intended, the payment of pensions and other social welfare benefits, it was raided to make the Minister for Finance look better. What we got yesterday in social welfare was more of the same. The gap between those on the poverty line and those in employment increased further. Another PPF commitment has fallen by the wayside.</P>
    <P>The years from 1997 to 2002 have been bad for those of us who believe in a fairer and more humane society and feel that the State's role and responsibility is to actively intervene to correct the distortions of our market economy. They have been disastrous years for those of us who looked forward to a time when this country would have the resources to turn the republican dreams of our fathers into reality.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now from my comments and criticisms of what is contained in the budget &ndash; understandably, as politicians elected to this House, we are partisan &ndash; and read into the record some of the comments from today's newspapers. Many of the commentators would be impartial, others no doubt have their own private views and support different political parties.</P>
    <P>The concluding sentence in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> editorial states: &ldquo;At a time when the economy has grown at an unprecedented pace, the stark reality remains that one in five Irish children is still going to school hungry.&rdquo;. The opening paragraph in the same editorial states:</P>
    <P>Make no mistake about it &ndash; underlying Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy's eleventh-hour conversion to tackling the problems of social inequality, the low paid, the most vulnerable in society and those in need &ndash; this is an election budget.</P>
    <P>However, reading between the lines of yesterday's funding allocations, this budget could be described as a short-term fix for the economy. Politically, the minister stands accused of indulging in a slick performance of sleight of hand, of massaging the figures, and of unashamed creative accounting. Nor are such criticisms without foundation. It is clear that while a surplus of 170 million is projected for this year, that upbeat scenario is predicted to change dramatically to a projected deficit of 3 billion in 2003, and to a deficit of 3.7 billion in 2004.</P>
    <P>The final quote from the editorial of the <i>Irish Examiner</i> states:</P>
    <P>While the Government plans to spend £6.5 billion a year on health, its failure to bring more people into the medical card scheme is disappointing. Bluntly, it means the continuation of what amounts to medical apartheid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> On the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, under the by-line, &ldquo;Comment&rdquo;, by Brendan Keenan, not one of the derided &ldquo;pinkos&rdquo; or lefties about whom the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, makes comment on occasion, it states:</P>
    <P>We have had Charlie the party-giver, and Charlie the gambler. Now, it's Charlie the squirrel. He has been busily burying surplus nuts during the good times of the last few years and yesterday, amid the chill of the economic slowdown, was the time to dig them up. There was the social insurance fund, where accumulated PRSI payments had exceeded social spending by £1.1 billion Mr. McCreevy dug £500m out of that. Then there was a secret hoard where he had stored some of the recent budget surpluses towards paying interest on the national debt. He left it alone this year, but will extract £400 million from it next year. He raided the Central Bank's fairly lavish store for another £400 million and pulled off a stunt favoured by predecessors in hard times &ndash; making business pay next year's taxes this year. One remembers a similar trick with something called VAT at point of entry. That came to a grant total of £3 billion, which is an awful lot of nuts. As a result, Mr. McCreevy was able to do the apparently impossible &ndash; continue spending money like water but have no recourse to borrowing, even in an economy expected to grow by no more than 4% next year.</P>
    <P>The final quote from that article states:</P>
    <P>The Government has left the hard choices until after the election. The EU Commission may well be startled by Department of Finance figures which show the public finances deteriorating by 3% of GDP next year and by 5% of GDP in 2003.</P>
    <P>The first sentence of the comment from the chief political correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, Chris Glennon, whom most people would say is an impartial correspondent, states: &ldquo;Charlie McCreevy made three daring cash raids to balance his final Budget before the general election.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the opening paragraph of a commentary in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, under the headline &ldquo;Budget 2002&rdquo;, which states: &ldquo;A quick raid on the Central Bank and a dip into the Social Insurance Fund afforded Mr. McCreevy the necessary resources to narrowly avoid a return to the days of deficit financing in Budget 2002.&rdquo;. The political editor of the same paper, John Downing, on its front page states: &ldquo;On the basis of Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy's own figures in yesterday's budget, the country will be almost £3 billion in debt by the year 2004&rdquo;. Further on in the article he states: &ldquo;Minister McCreevy's own figures show he has effectively mortgaged the future of the country &ndash; leaving us <Col N="36" /> £2.4 billion in debt by 2003, and £2.9 billion in the red for the year after&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to a very impartial reporter, Mr. Sam Smyth, a man known to us all. In the <i>Irish Independent</i>, under a headline, &ldquo;What a great budget &ndash; if you're a betting landlord, that is&rdquo;, he states:</P>
    <P>The Minister raided the Social Insurance (SI) fund for £635 million (806 million) and scooped another £480 million (610 million) from the Central Bank's euro windfall. Yesterday, a leading accountant said that if Charlie McCreevy presented his clients' accounts to the Revenue in the same obfuscating way that he laid his budget before the Dáil, he would probably be arrested.</P>

      <P>The article continues:</P>
      <P>If you enjoy playing with mirrors, or the pleasures of the three-card trick, it was a virtuoso performance. In all, the Minister conjured up a whopping 2 billion euros from the three sources and announced he would not be borrowing by 2002. It didn't stop there. There were hints of another stroke as we approach the election. The Central Bank has already been put on notice that the Minister wants some of its surplus reserves &ndash; apart from the euro money &ndash; in the coming year.</P>
      <P>And there is no knowing where the money will be bunged . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. McCreevy protested that he didn't favour only the better off in the Budget. He didn't. He simply favoured them disproportionately. New tax breaks were introduced for the con<Col N="37" /> struction of private hospitals; tax relief schemes were extended and investment in private rental accommodation was encouraged.</P>
    <P>The editorial of <i>The Irish Times</i> states:</P>
    <P>No Minister for Finance in the history of the State ever had it as good as Mr McCreevy who, year after year, has been able to deliver tax cuts along with spending increases. This year an Exchequer surplus was denied him but he still managed to find the money for both increased benefits and higher spending.</P>
    <P>My quotations are selective, but balanced. Although less critical than some of the other newspapers, nevertheless <i>The Irish Times </i>editorial is critical. It states:</P>
    <P>The social insurance fund is showing a surplus &ndash; which it may one day need &ndash; but he takes it. The Central Bank makes a profit on the euro switchover and he takes that too. In terms of budgetary integrity, there is little difference between going into debt or using up valuable reserves. Mr McCreevy did not, as his critics claim, falsify the figures but there is something of the three-card trick in the way he presented them.</P>
    <P>The grab for revenue has been both careful and sloppy.</P>
    <P>I could quote from many other pieces. I refer Members, in particular, to the critique of the budget by that left-wing economist, Moore McDowell. </P>

We were all elected to the House on foot of the landslide election of 1977.

      <P>This year's budget, the fifth and last of the current series, is a prudent budget committed to the urgent task of underpinning national development. Above all, it is a caring and equitable budget in keeping with our radical social philosophy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has made magnificent progress, which is recognised everywhere, over the past four years. Our earlier budgets were central to boosting confidence and prolonging, for as long as international circumstances allowed, an unprecedented period of high growth which has allowed us to catch up with our European partners. While last year's record growth of 10% is likely to be halved this year, international agencies are still predicting that we will head the inter<Col N="40" /> national growth league in 2002. This is not a bad achievement for a small country.</P>
    <P>We have used every opportunity available to create close to full employment, build a competitive tax system in place of the unfair tax burden working people had to bear in the past and set out long-term plans in every area where we badly need progress. When we took office unemployment still stood at 10%, whereas today it is down to around 4%. In addition, numbers at work have increased from about 1.4 million people to more than 1.7 million people. Getting so close to full employment is the biggest social achievement in the history of the State. No one will be surprised that it was achieved with Fianna Fáil in Government together with our Progressive Democrats partners.</P>
    <P>We have used to the full the opportunity to do the maximum for social inclusion in other ways as well. All the emphasis of the budget is directed towards the least well-off and improving public services.</P>
    <P>Given the slowdown in the world economy, the budget is a fine achievement. We have managed, for the fifth year in succession, to avoid Government borrowing. The Labour Party in contrast, has urged us to borrow more than £1 billion and to raid the national pension reserve fund. Where would confidence be today if we had followed that advice?</P>
    <P>We are not going to return to the bad old days of the 1970s style deficit economics. As we see from the experience of other countries, it is very easy to allow the public finances to deteriorate quickly and to get into a hole. That does not bring benefits to everyone and just means expenditure cuts, higher taxes, higher unemployment and a steep rise in poverty. It is difficult to predict what situation the Government will face this time next year but projections for 2003 and 2004 show a general Government deficit of 0.6% of GDP, comfortably within the 3% allowed by the EU Stability Pact. Many larger countries are already bumping up against that ceiling. In looking at our absolute figures, commentators are apt to overlook the 1% of GDP being set aside for pensions which has everything to do with the long-term sustainability of the public finances.</P>
    <P>The public will need to decide next summer whether it really wants an alternative Government, which is not up to the job and which will ring the alarm bells, panic and destroy confidence, as opposed to an experienced Administration which will cope in the best available way with all eventualities.</P>
    <P>It was somewhat difficult to listen to a lecture in the usual tone of effortless superiority from a former Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes,&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy criticised a Minister who in five years has not borrowed a single penny in net terms and who will leave the national debt well below the level he found it. The Minister has very properly marshalled available resources to avoid a plunge into borrowing at this stage when we do not have any real idea of how long the economic slowdown will last. All the measures he has announced must be passed into law and confirmed by the Oireachtas. The prudence and the margin of safety created over recent years has paid off. If this is not a rainy day, I am not sure what is.</P>
      <P>I find it laughable that the Labour Party, whose spokesperson has been urging us to raid the pension fund all year, becomes all concerned that we are using the surplus in the social insurance fund to part-fund increased social benefits. How often has the State had to put in additional funding in the region of £11 billion, if I recall the figure correctly? The social insurance fund is based on a tripartite principle. The Exchequer has assisted it in the past through substantial transfers for most of its history when it faced a deficit. There is nothing untoward in the fund reciprocating. Even after the event, there will still be a large and growing surplus in the fund of 1.2 billion. There is no question of contributors' benefits being put at risk. That should be made clear.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here with surpluses and surpluses mean amounts above and beyond requirements. Is it not reasonable to recover some of the Exchequer's earlier contributions, particularly as we are putting much more money in on the other side anticipating future deficits in the social insurance fund in relation to pensions? In net terms, far from raiding the social insurance fund, this Government is preparing to beef it up in the future amid loud complaints from the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>The other focus of attention is the transfer from the Central Bank. In the case of coinage, the ultimate property right in the profits from coinage issue has always been the Minister for Finance's. That is clear in the legislation since 1927. In other countries, the profits go directly to the public purse whereas here they accumulate in the Central Bank. What is being done is a legitimate exercise of the people's property right.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of the windfall surplus to the bank arising on the exchange of currency notes by the bank is not unusual either. The position since 1942, when the bank was set up, is that the Minister is entitled to have a portion of the surplus transferred to the Exchequer. Every <Col N="42" /> Government has availed of that surplus and that is what we propose to do. There is nothing out of the ordinary in this procedure.</P>
      <P>What is different is that we are using these sums in a prudent manner by using them to help fund the national pensions reserve fund where they will be effectively locked away for at least another 25 years. This is hardly an imprudent or incautious course. It is certainly not what a raider would do. What is really upsetting the Opposition is that the Government has been able to put together a far better budget than it believed possible. When Opposition Members cry foul, their cry is to be understood in political terms.</P>

Half way through the last election campaign I eventually drew out the then Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte's support for the idea.

The minimum wage was originally a Fianna Fáil initiative introduced during the last election, one which this Government implemented, and 90% of the minimum wage will now be tax free.

      <P>The old age pension has increased by almost 50%, from £78 in 1997 to £116 in 2002 and for a married couple it has increased from just over £100 to just under £200. Increases before 1998 simply kept pace with inflation, and more and more older people were falling into poverty. This year's increase is more than 9%. Furthermore, the old age pension will next year be at least 30% of the current average industrial wage. The sensible policy is to raise other payments, as and when this is possible. It will be my objective to pursue a strategy of increasing other payments, as resources permit, so that a broadly similar level in relation to average living standards in the community can in due course be achieved for all social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>This Government has given a very high priority to investing in our health services. As a result of the additional spending announced yesterday, health funding will be 134% higher than when we came to office. This represents the largest sustained increase in health funding in the history of our health services.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell yesterday claimed that this funding is not having an impact. He even supported his leader's claim that the health services were better under his stewardship. As with so many areas, this is a case of the Opposition making up the figures, when they do not like the facts. Deputy Mitchell yesterday claimed that the current waiting list figure represents a 91% increase since we took office. The figures publicly available and given to this House show that&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;they are down by more than 13%. In contrast, the waiting lists rose by an unprecedented 6,500, or 28%, when Deputies Noonan and Quinn were in charge. As a result of our increased investment, more and better paid professionals are delivering significantly more services. This year more than 4,000 more doctors, nurses, dentists and paramedics are delivering care than in 1997 and 90,000 more hospital treatments are being carried out than in 1997. There are more than 4,000 more day residential and respite care places to help people with disabilities and their families than there were in 1997.</P>
      <P>These are improvements, making a difference in the lives of people. We have always said we see the work to date as a foundation. We have set out our plans for building on this foundation, and the budget has provided for the first phase of development. The health strategy which we launched last week is the most comprehensive and ambitious document of its type ever launched. It has received wide support. The Patients' Association for example has called it &ldquo;Welcome and well thought out&rdquo;. It is a strategy of investment and reform which will achieve the permanent transformation of our health system.</P>
      <P>Having failed to seriously challenge the strategy's proposals, the Opposition has attacked the fact that not every element of the strategy will be implemented in year one. If one were to believe the Opposition Deputies, everything can be done at once. We are committed to increasing the coverage of the medical card scheme. That is why we have already extended it to all people over 70 &ndash; the age group who rely most of all on our health services. We will go further in our next term. What I find most extraordinary in the Opposition's attack on this point is that the policy of indexation of income guidelines which we have implemented is exactly the one implemented by Deputies Quinn and Noonan. In addition, even though they demanded that the full strategy proposal be implemented next year, Labour's pre-budget statement did not mention either health or medical cards.</P>
      <P>The additional funding we have provided will deliver significant service improvements next year. It will end all over 12 month waiting for adults and it will end all over 6 month waiting for children.</P>

It will extend 24-hour GP cover nation-wide and it will ensure important developments in areas such as cardiac care, cancer care, child care and youth homelessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will go before the people with a record of developing our health services and planning for the future which will far outstrip that of any pre<Col N="47" /> vious Government. We will also have shown our commitment to investing in the future by investing in education. We have comprehensively reversed the policy of our predecessors, which saw Deputy Quinn's January 1997 budget include a freezing in school funding and cutbacks in teacher numbers. In contrast, direct school funding for primary schools is now more than two thirds higher, and we are in the middle of a programme to hire 2,500 new teachers. We have achieved the lowest class sizes in the history of Irish education, and they are set to decline further. We have also opened up opportunity by increasing adult literacy funding more than tenfold, and we have created more than 15,000 new third level places.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks we have heard the Opposition attempt to claim that there has been a cutback in the funding for school building projects. The facts show &ndash; and I want to deal with this because it is being run outside the House very diligently by at least some Opposition spokespersons &ndash; that this is another misrepresentation of the truth and we have heard much in the past 24 hours about truth. The January 1997 budget allocated 74 million to all school building projects. Yesterday's budget allocated 335 million and the impact of this funding can be seen throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1997 there were only 22 large scale school building projects under way. At the moment, there are 200 under way. That shows a real and sustained commitment to our schools and to our education system. An OECD study published this week saw Irish 15-year olds with the second highest ranking in Europe for literacy, significantly above average in relation to scientific literacy, and average in relation to mathematical ability. We have done better than many larger countries, ranking higher than the United States on all scores. The person who has lead that change is the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea and I congratulate him.</P>
      <P>We must continue to attach great importance to jobs. The reduction of employers' PRSI from 12% to 10.75% is a major boost to competitiveness that largely compensates for the removal of the ceiling and will help employers, in more difficult times, to maintain, sustain and grow employment. We have also taken steps to remedy difficulties in the construction industry related to the housing market by restoring tax reliefs, and to increase the supply of apartments for renting which are urgently needed by young people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not going to correct the record but we will put the facts on record. As soon as I said one thing, Deputy Gilmore went out and extended it by about 500 times. Let me finish what I was saying the other day. I said that, under the Programme for Partnership and Fairness, the commitment was ready to start and acquire 12,000 local authority houses in the four year period of 2000-03. The Government subsequently increased the target to 25,000, as Deputy Gilmore pointed out to me the other day, in the action for public housing document published last year. We discussed what was happening on the PPF sub-committee and I said what I had to say on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2000, the first year of the programme, 5,079 new starts were achieved. While this was somewhat less than expected much of local authority effort last year had to go into the planning stages of ramping up for the programme. As I said on Tuesday, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, had to put considerable effort into working with local authorities to achieve what he did last year. He worked extremely hard with the resources available and pressed right through the autumn of last year. This he successfully managed <Col N="49" /> to do and the benefits of these increased planning efforts are now being seen. Some 7,000 starts are expected this year recovering most of the lost ground last year. By the end of this year &ndash; the half-way point in the programme &ndash; it is expected that over 48% of the increased target for programme starts will have been achieved subject to resources, which thankfully were provided yesterday. The Minister of State has the resources and the target of 25,000 starts by the end of 2003 is still considered attainable.</P>
    <P>The Government is totally committed to the implementation of the national development plan. We have topped up capital spending by over £400 million, which includes what works out at 146 million for housing and 100 million for national road improvements. There is another 30 million for public transport. It should be remembered that in 1997 the Exchequer was contributing nothing to public transport, which was relying on EU funding and borrowing, whereas 388 million is being provided next year. If we wish to criticise the lack of past investment in public transport, which was a big issue here yesterday when Deputy Jim Mitchell was trying to talk to the people driving home which has led to the gridlock, we need look no further than the previous Government which spent no Exchequer money on public transport. How dare it come in here and lecture us when it spent nothing.</P>

The Exchequer was contributing nothing to public transport in 1997, but relied on EU funding and borrowing whereas 388 million is being provided next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing for which poor people are grateful, that is, this is, thankfully, the last budget the Government will ever introduce. Fianna Fáil and its partners will be judged on their record over five years, not just five months. It is quite shocking to discover that in the past four budgets two thirds of all surplus resources have been allocated to tax reductions for the richest 30% of our society who have received over half of all available resources. Yesterday's budget will not undo the damage caused by the previous four in the name of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people have already seen through the half-baked accountancy exercise presented in the House last night. This is arguably the most dubious budget ever presented. Whoever forms the next Administration will have to deal with the projected 3 billion deficit as we enter 2003. Yesterday, the Minister for Finance put a small elas<Col N="51" /> toplast over the difficult financial situation that we face. He was fooling nobody when he suggested that no borrowing would result from measures announced yesterday. In fact, he borrowed away the future benefits of workers when he decided to raid the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>The social welfare system is just one of the ways the State can help and intervene to protect the standard of living of low income families. In recent years, despite the considerable resources at the disposal of the Government, the real standard of living for some of the poorest people in the country has substantially disimproved. Their story can be seen in the misery inflicted on over 120,000 people awaiting social housing or in the poor condition of the public health service for the needy of the country. Poverty is wider and deeper than the issue of income alone. As was admitted recently by the Government, in excess of 50,000 local authority homes have no central heating. A scandal in our country must be the level of fuel poverty, particularly at this time of year, for those living in the social housing sector.</P>
    <P>It does not matter how the Minister for Finance dresses up the figures &ndash; the Government has allowed the sharpest rise ever on the issue of relative income poverty. This is a fact, not a philosophical construction. The gap between rich and poor is growing at an alarming rate and this budget will do nothing to help those in difficult income situations. The Government should be ashamed. A weekly income of £93 for a person on unemployment assistance or social welfare allowance is not just or acceptable. More progress should have been made to meet the £100 target for the lowest rate of social welfare, a key target of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>I now know the reason the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has refused to sign up to the majority recommendation of the benchmarking and indexation group which recommended that by 2007 the lowest rate of social welfare should represent 27% of gross average industrial earnings. The Minister knows that it will be virtually impossible to make progress in linking welfare rates to general wage levels in the economy when the financial situation looks so grim in the years ahead. The proposed £8 increase in all social welfare schemes is ahead of projected inflation next year. However, there is a projected 8% increase in wage inflation over the same period. As long as the situation continues where wage inflation outstrips the consumer price index, we will continue to see a substantial rise in relative income poverty.</P>
    <P>The small increases in various social welfare schemes announced yesterday had Members opposite in wild applause. They greeted the announcements as if something significant had happened. The real issue is that for a significant minority the problem of putting food on the table for their families will continue in the year ahead. In their world they live with ever increasing food bills which make it more difficult to make ends <Col N="52" /> meet. The St. Vincent de Paul Society has already highlighted the fact that 60% of the weekly income of low income families is spent on food. Increasing VAT, petrol and other old reliables will only add to the increasing difficulty this group will face.</P>
    <P>The social insurance fund raid by the Government is the greatest con job since the days when Fianna Fáil decided to buy the votes of the people in the 1977 general election campaign. The move is illegal and flies in the face of providing a social security fund which benefits those who have paid into it. Those who pay PRSI have seen their fund decimated by the trickery announced by the Minister for Finance yesterday. The PAYE sector must now look upon this fund as nothing more than tax through the back door. If the Minister really wanted to hand something back from it to the PAYE sector, why did he not reduce employee PRSI? If we pay into something, we expect to get something back. People make contributions on the basis that the fund will be available for future benefits. The raiding of the fund ensures that future benefits, such as paid paternity leave or enhanced redundancy payments, cannot be put in place by a future Government. This raid is also irresponsible given the likely increase in the number of unemployed in the next year. The reduction in employer's PRSI will further reduce the fund for possible future benefits.</P>
    <P>The policy is a sham. The Government wants to borrow on the backs of future generations of workers, but they will not get away with it as this money does not exist for electioneering. Did the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs have discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions before the decision was taken to raid the fund? He owes it to people inside and outside the House to appear here this afternoon to explain what discussions took place with ICTU.</P>
    <P>One of the most appalling things about the budget is the fact that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs cannot pay what are relatively small increases in social welfare from 1 January. No other category of customer who deals with the State would accept this. The Minister knew for over two years that it was the Government's intention to realign the tax year from 1 January 2002, but, despite this, many social welfare recipients will have to wait until February to obtain a small backdated payment. It is clear that prompt payment legislation does not exist for those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister telling the country that for the past two years he was unable to develop an administrative system to give social welfare recipients their small increases on time? If he admits that, he is admitting to gross incompetence. No other category of worker would allow a situation to develop where their increases were backdated six or eight weeks. Social welfare customers are dealt with differently by the Government, which shows a clear policy of discrimi<Col N="53" /> nation against them. The Revenue Commissioners practises prompt payment with its customers but social welfare customers are told to wait six weeks. This is not good enough and, with available technology, I do not accept the Minister's arguments that he could not have developed an administrative system to deliver the increases from 1 January.</P>
    <P>There has been much play about the increases given to pensioners, but those on non-contributory pensions will continue to see a significant difference between their pensions and those of contributory pensioners. More should have been done to improve non-contributory pensions. The difficult budgetary situation we will face over the next 12 months, as I said earlier, will make it more difficult to improve the lot of pensioners.</P>
    <P>The small changes to the free schemes are welcome and I look forward to the opportunity to consider them in the Social Welfare Bill. Tax individualisation, now a permanent feature of our tax policy, does not apply to social welfare recipients. It is unacceptable that a married pensioner couple should not be treated as two individuals when pension income is assessed. This is another Government failure. If the Minister is serious about helping widows, he should have extended all the benefits under the free schemes to help them. They have been treated atrociously by the Government. The £12 increase in the widow's contributory pension only applies to those aged over 66 years. Virtually nothing was done to help young widows. I challenge commentators to read the details of the proposals instead of taking the headline announcements at face value.</P>
    <P>After three years in office the Government finally made progress last year in child benefit, following lobbying by the Opposition and many agencies which work in the child poverty area. Increasing child benefit is the most effective way of tackling child poverty. One in eight children experience consistent poverty. As was recently highlighted, Ireland has the sixth highest percentage of children living in income poverty among the 22 OECD countries. Parents should receive child benefit on a weekly or fortnightly basis. The Government should amend the Social Welfare Bill to allow this.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest disappointments in yesterday's statement was about child dependent allowances. This is one of the few areas where low income families obtain additional support, but the rates have remained unchanged since 1993 and there are many anomalies relating to the different ones that apply. An opportunity was missed to reform it. Why was a proposal from the PPF, to extend CDAs to all children up to the age of 22 years in full-time education, not brought forward? The proposal to change the back to school footwear and clothing allowance represents a tiny improvement to a scheme which has the potential to help directly low income families. We will return to this in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> The Government failed to deliver significant benefits for carers. None of us should forget that family carers save the State about £1.8 billion in unpaid work. The changes announced yesterday will increase the total number who can obtain carer's allowance, but the Department estimates that at least 52,000 full-time carers exist but only 22,000 receive the allowance. The income disregard for a couple will increase to £250, but it should be increased to £370, twice the current minimum wage. Nothing was done to allow carers receive social welfare benefits and their allowance or to introduce a cost of care grant to meet the massive costs involved in caring for a loved one or friend. In short, they are the big losers in the budget. The increase in the respite care grant is not enough to offset the Minister's failure to improve significantly the income disregard for carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>The decision to restore mortgage interest relief for those involved in the private rented sector and to substantially reduce stamp duty was castigated by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, only three weeks ago in the House when he said:</P>
    <P>The Government does not believe that speculators are equal to first time house buyers. When the Government took office, speculators were having a great time in the housing market. They were buying numerous houses, getting rich quickly and squeezing first time house buyers out of the market.</P>
    <P>He spoke of why speculators should be taken out of the market and why mortgage interest relief should not be re-introduced for the private rented sector. The Minister was not here yesterday, this morning or now. He has clearly lost another battle at Cabinet. He had other losses over the dual mandate, the planning system and the electoral system. Does he have any credibility at all? The time has come for him to consider his position. In all the areas in which he has stated positions of principle, the Government, and specifically the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, have dumped on him. He should resign because the Government which he supports is not introducing measures he has outlined. Today or tomorrow, he should make a statement about the announcements on the housing market.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance travels in his chauffeur driven car from the corporate box in Croke Park to the reserved enclosure in the Curragh and to dinner in the K Club, life must appear very rosy. It is a long way from the life lived by many people in my constituency. He put himself forward yesterday as the new champion of the poor. After five years in office, the Government has squandered the boom. The social divisions between our people have never been greater. The majority of right-thinking people will reject the McCreevy ideology when it is presented to the people next year in the general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak on two issues. I believe the issue of the environment has been completely neglected in this budget. The only reference made by the Minister in his speech was to the climate change policies. Last year the Government adopted the national climate change strategy. It was a recognition that climate change is now a global environmental problem. Last year after extensive consultation the Government produced the national climate change strategy. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, referred to the need to reduce sulphur emissions. Sulphur is not a greenhouse gas. This is a complete con-job, a fobbing off and trying to give the impression that something was done to meet our commitments under the Kyoto agreement. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has just returned from a meeting in Marrakech where the agreement was discussed. President Bush rejected the Kyoto agreement. We are committed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We have one of the highest rates of emissions in the EU. We have been let off the hook by the EU. The targets which we are bound to reach by the year 2008 are not as onerous as those imposed on other countries.</P>
      <P>The climate change strategy produced by the Minister last year recognised that global weather conditions have focused our minds on the potentially devastating impact of climate change. Ireland could experience higher winter rainfall with much more severe flooding, lower summer rainfall and water shortages, rising sea levels, accelerated coastal erosion and loss of bogland. The list goes on.</P>
      <P>Last year we were told that the Government would introduce appropriate tax measures to prioritise the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from 2002 onwards. The Minister made a commitment under a global agreement that this country would reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane gas and nitrous oxide. Another opportunity has passed in which we could have addressed our obligations under that agreement. Where stands the commitment to the environment now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past five years we have seen no measures to address the increasing problems in waste management. Yesterday under the section dealing with the environment, £16 million was allocated for waste management. Yet last week in the Estimates we were told by the Minister that he does not spend the money allocated to him for waste management because he regards waste management as a matter for local authorities. When will the Minister take charge of waste management and introduce a coherent, national plan to ensure that waste management is addressed in a meaningful fashion across the country? This morning the Minister is visiting illegal dumps in Blessington, County Wicklow. There are further reports of illegal dumping in Fingal in north Dub<Col N="56" /> lin. I have no doubt but that these reports are only the tip of the iceberg. This illegal dumping has been going on wholesale across the country. The Minister responsible for environmental protection washes his hands of the matter and says that it is a matter for the local authorities and bodies other than himself.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £16 million for waste management will certainly be spent on an inquiry to establish the extent of illegal dumping. It will go nowhere towards addressing remedial measures necessary to rectify the present situation. Wicklow County Council is investigating up to 100 illegal dumps. The taxpayer will have to pay for that. It certainly will not be funded from the £16 million allocation.</P>
    <P>Where is the necessary infrastructure to develop a recycling culture in this country? Where are the segregated waste systems? There are some pilot projects in Dublin. That is not recycling. We all know that most of that waste is ending up in landfill sites. There are no recycling facilities in this country and no recycling initiatives. It is all being shipped abroad. The Smurfit company deals with cardboard and the collection of waste paper. It is shipping the material abroad and is forced to chase markets in China because the UK market has dried up. We do not have the facilities to deal with it on this island. There are proposals for seven incinerators but not one proposal to develop a paper recycling facility. The Minister is aware that paper can be recycled easily and I know that he has received submissions on this proposal. We should deal with our waste in an efficient manner but we need someone to take control of the issue and manage it in a competent fashion.</P>
    <P>Depending on local authorities to cobble together a national waste management infrastructure and recycling system is not feasible. They do not have the expertise nor the finances. It is an <i>ad hoc </i>approach to something that is a national problem.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael and the Labour Party have proposed a national waste management authority to take hold of the situation and to put the infrastructure in place. The people are frustrated by the lack of advancement, the lack of movement in our waste management policy. We have one of the worst records in Europe. Less than 9% of our municipal waste is recycled and the rest is disposed of in landfill sites. We are learning more every day about the extent of illegal dumping and it is an indictment of the Government's approach to waste management.</P>
    <P>We are fast moving towards a national crisis. We see the extent of that crisis in the media reports. The cost of that clean-up and the effect it has had on our environment is inmeasurable. Dumping hazardous waste, household waste and municipal waste in unprotected and unlicensed sites is having severe effects on our water courses and land. It is a problem that has not been sorted out. We have had numerous policy statements by the Minister about the waste management prob<Col N="57" /> lem. In 1998 he produced Changing our Ways. Here we are facing 2002 and we still have not changed our ways. The figures are getting worse. The waste mountain is increasing, landfill sites are closing and there is lack of recycling infrastructure and manufacturing capacity to deal with recycling materials.</P>
    <P>There is an allocation of 100 million for road improvements and 38 million for water and sewerage services. That will not contribute to an increase in the protection and treatment of water. We are all aware of the cost overruns in major treatment plants which are planned for Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford. The nature of ground works is such that they run into problems. They can meet rock or encounter unforeseen construction difficulties. The contribution shown here to water and sewerage services refers to money that is already spent on projects that are in place or at an advanced stage of construction. This does not go any way towards the level of investment needed in water and sewerage projects.</P>
    <P>The £25 increase in child benefit is welcomed by those of us who have been involved in campaigning for child care. It means £92 for the first two children and £116 for the third and fourth which gives £416 per month for four children. It goes some way towards the cost of child care but local authorities and others face enormous difficulties in providing crèches and other child care facilities as well as getting staff to work in the area.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen more imaginative measures introduced in the budget. If an employer provides a crèche, that is not allowed as a benefit in kind. That is something that should have been done. Measures should have been introduced to encourage those with child care qualifications to take up positions. Those people are leaving the country or going into other professions. Apart from the cost, there is also a huge problem with supply. Last year's increase was taken up completely in crèche charges. Although an additional £25 per month is welcome, this only represents the cost of one day in a crèche and there are 20 working days in a month.</P>
    <P>In most cases, the woman who stays at home with the children will not be greatly influenced by this provision. More imaginative measures to reduce the cost of child care are needed. We should consider parental leave, family friendly work places, etc. This problem needs to be addressed because many women who have qualifications and energy and want to contribute to the workplace are being held back. As many employers will tell the Tánaiste, we need imaginative measures to encourage women to come back to work. We must get away from strict nine to five work regimes. The State has invested in the education of these women but they are not able to contribute in the work force. The Tánaiste has responsibility for employment and the Government needs to do much more to facilitate women in whatever way it can.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods. Being in the Chamber with Deputy Clune and Deputy Keaveney in the Chair gives me a sense of what an all-female parliament might be like, with the exception, of course, of the wonderful staff in the centre.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat coalition Government delivered the fifth of our five budgets. Very few Administrations in recent years have had the privilege of delivering five budgets. If my memory serves me correctly, the last Government to do so was the 1973 to 1977 coalition Government. When we took office in 1997, many commentators, including many Members of the Opposition, felt the Government would not last five months, never mind deliver five budgets. During those five years and five budgets, we had an opportunity to implement a clear and coherent strategy for ordering our fiscal, economic and social affairs.</P>
      <P>We laid down a number of principles that guided us in the strategy for this country. We set out to achieve prudent management of the public finances. It is only through sound government that it is possible to have a sound economy. We set out to give incentives to investment because we know it is the only way to increase employment and generate prosperity. We set out to reform the tax and PRSI systems to make it worthwhile for people to move from welfare to work and to reward working people. We set out to protect the less well off in society because we believe that by delivering record increases in welfare payments we protect social justice, the bedrock on which our society is built. Any objective analysis of the five budgets shows the fantastic results this Government has achieved. Our record is extraordinary.</P>
      <P>In the past 24 hours there has been considerable confusion and scaremongering over the public finances. From the comments of some, people might think we were about to fall off the cliff or go back to the 1980s style of economic chaos. The normal test of fiscal prudence is the ability of a Government to manage its day-to-day affairs, its current account, in other words its ability to raise on a current basis sufficient resources to meet its day-to-day spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By any measure, the present Government has been extraordinarily successful. We have run a surplus on our current account in each year since coming to office. In 1998, it was £2.1 billion; in 1999 it was £3.4 billion; in 2000 it was £5.5 billion; and in 2001 it was £3.5 billion. From the reports of yesterday's budget, people might think we were about to return to deficit budgeting. However, I am happy to say that is not the case. This year the current budget surplus will be £4.4 billion; next year it will be £3.4 billion; and even in 2004, it is forecast on a conservative basis to be £3.6 billion. Over the next three years, that averages between 4% and 5% of our national output. It is the kind of budgetary performance <Col N="59" /> that would make ministers and governments in any country in the world very envious indeed. In Ireland, however, there seems to be a certain sense of begrudgery.</P>
    <P>We did not achieve these surpluses by increasing taxes. We did so by giving incentives to business, increasing employment and reducing taxes on work, capital and corporations. We did not achieve the surpluses by reducing public spending. By any standards, our record on public spending is extraordinary. While we were generating huge budget surpluses, we have increased social welfare spending by 66%. We have increased spending on the old age pension by 50% and a couple, both aged over 66, have seen their pension increase by 54%. We have increased spending on health by 125%. We have increased spending on child benefit by 300%. We have huge surpluses that are unprecedented without reducing social spending. On the contrary we have hugely increased it by a factor of three in many cases and we have reduced taxes. That is the prudent way to manage the public finances in this country.</P>
    <P>A number of questions have been raised about how the Government compiled its figures for this year's budget. Reference has been made to fraud and deceit. The Minister put on the record yesterday in a clear, open and transparent fashion how the money will be raised. It is there in black and white; it is not concealed. Some commentators and Deputies believe we should borrow money.</P>

      <P>I do not need Deputy Quinn to read the newspapers for me as I can read them myself. I do not need to take opinion polls to find out what my policies should be. I believe in certain things, such as if effort is rewarded and investment incentivised, things will happen. The Government has proved that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the budgetary arithmetic, we will run a budget surplus on the current account next year of £4.8 billion. We will raise in revenue £4.8 billion more than we will spend. Where we have a difficulty is trying to meet the ambitious capital programme we have put forward through our national development plan. We all recognise that notwithstanding the huge progress made in this country in recent years our infrastructure is not what it should be. Some would suggest we should <Col N="60" /> borrow money for infrastructure, such as roads, public transport, health, education, water and sewerage, which is necessary to grow employment and maintain our competitiveness. I reject that. The money could be borrowed if we did not have another way to find it and everybody would justify that. However, does it make sense to have funds which are surplus to requirements sitting in the Central Bank of Ireland? What value is it to the national infrastructure to leave money sitting in a Central Bank account when it could be applied to build the infrastructure of the country rather than borrow money from international bankers and increase the national debt? Is anyone seriously suggesting that for some ideological reason or a reason unknown to me &ndash; it is weird economics &ndash; we should leave money sitting in a bank account and borrow money from international bankers to complete our roads and provide for a public transport, health and education infrastructure? It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>The other source of money which is being attacked is the allocation of approximately 635 million from the social insurance fund, which is in surplus in 2001 to the tune of 1.4 billion. Next year, even when we take the money out, it will be in surplus to the tune of 1.2 billion. Is someone seriously saying that we should leave it there, borrow money and let the taxpayers service the debt which will be increased as a result of borrowings? That does not make sense. When the social insurance fund was in deficit in the ten years to 1996, £2 billion was put into it by the Exchequer. Is it reasonable at a time when there is a surplus to use that money wisely, not for day to day spending or to fritter it away, but to help to complete the capital programme necessary to make this a country of which we can all be proud?</P>
    <P>As regards the social insurance fund, I may be accused of comparing apples and oranges, although I am not, but in Deputy Quinn's last budget as Minister for Finance in the Rainbow Government he was prepared to put the social insurance fund in deficit to the tune of £80 million to meet his budgetary arithmetic. It did not happen because there was a change of Government, employment grew and the fund ended up marginally in surplus. However, that Government's arithmetic in 1997 was based on a calculation that the social insurance fund would be allowed to go into deficit because PRSI was going to be reduced from 5.5% to 4.5%. That was the projection in Deputy Quinn's Budget Statement and that Government was prepared to stand over it. It is ironic that a Government which was prepared to put the fund into deficit to meet its budgetary requirements in an election year is now criticising us because we are taking a sum of money out of that fund to meet the capital and infrastructural requirements of the economy.</P>
    <P>I also heard criticism about bringing forward the date for the payment of corporation tax. There has not been any Government in the history of this country which has been more pro-business than this Government. All the objective <Col N="61" /> analysis done and the comments made in the public domain by business sources and organisations have often confirmed that. The Government has taken the standard rate of corporation tax down from 36% when we came to office to 16% as a result of yesterday's budget. The Government halved capital gains tax to make more things happen and to reward risk takers. As a result of that decision, the yield from capital gains tax has increased by 71%. Yesterday the Government reduced the rate of employers' PRSI by 1.25% because we want to maintain employment. We know the payroll and overall costs of employing individuals is what matters to companies. We want to ensure that Ireland remains attractive and competitive. No one should lecture me about whether we are pro-businesss. The Labour Party feels we are too pro-business. Last night Deputy Rabbitte criticised what he called the windfall being given to employers and employer organisations.</P>
    <P>As regards bringing forward the date for the payment of corporation tax, in every country in the OECD, including the United States which is the home of the free market and the most successful economy in the world historically, companies pay their corporate tax on a current year basis. All PAYE citizens do not see their tax as it is taken from their income. The self-employed pay their tax on a current year basis. The Minister said that over the next five years we will move to a situation where corporations, like the rest of us, will pay their tax on a current year basis. I accept there may be some marginal difficulties, but I want to put them on the record because people do not seem to understand them. If a company on 10% tax, in other words, a manufacturing company which does not receive any benefit from reducing the rate of corporation tax because it gets the lowest rate of 10%, makes a profit of 10 million, it will pay 1 million in tax. If it must borrow the money to pay the extra tax this year which it should pay next year, it will pay that at a rate of approximately 6% and it will cost them 6,300. Is somebody seriously telling me that 6,300 is an incredible obstacle for a company which earns 10 million? We could take the example of a service company which earns profits of 10 million and it is not on 10% tax. It will benefit from the reduction from 20% to 16%. It will gain 389,920 as a result of yesterday's decision. Who will tell me that is anti-business?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes said this morning that what the Minister was doing in this regard was a once-off measure. It is not because it has implications in the budgetary arithmetic for the next five years. It will bring in an extra 792 million to the 2002 accounts, an extra 821 million in 2003, an extra 945 million in 2004, an extra 1.073 billion in 2005 and an extra 1.124 billion in 2006. That will be done over five years at 20% per year.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hayes referred to the rich and poor. I want to put one figure on the record because it speaks volumes about what the Government has done. How have our budgetary policies and tax changes affected people on what I call average incomes? What are their average tax rates as a result of what we have done? Since the Government took office a single person on £12,000 a year has had the average rate of tax reduced from 18% to less than 2%. A single person on £20,000 a year has had the average rate of tax reduced from 29% to 14% per year and a person on £60,000 a year has had the rate reduced from 44% to 32%. The huge increases are for those at the bottom.</P>
      <P>When we took office a single person paid tax on income greater than £77 per week, but as a result of yesterday's budget, he or she will not begin to pay tax until he or she has earned £165 per week. If we had not radically transformed the tax system and introduced tax credits, that could not have been done. As we approach the next election, we need to know from the parties opposite what their policies are. The Government wants to keep taxes down and employment high. We need to hear from others what they intend to do in relation to tax and employment.</P>

      <P>The prophets of doom are shell-shocked. One can see it on the television screens. They expected a deficit and a downturn, into which they were talking us. Instead, they got a surplus, albeit a small one. It is a good break-even, which is what we need just now, economically and competitively. The message we want to go out around the world is that Ireland is fighting back and its economic fundamentals are still very strong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party states, &ldquo;Do not borrow for day-to-day purposes,&rdquo; but those purposes are related to people &ndash; old age pensioners, widows and those with a disability. If we look at the record of the Labour Party and Fine Gael, we see that when they were stuck for cash they put back payments to widows and old age pensioners to October and, eventually, July. We are paying them from 1 January. That is an enormous breakthrough. The Opposition claims we brought forward payments to help cash flow in that area, but <Col N="63" /> it was done by bringing forward the cash from corporation profits, among other sources. That was a different approach. It put people first and then looked at where the money could be found. We introduced more equity into the system by bringing forward corporation profits.</P>
    <P>The Christmas bonus was reduced by the rainbow Government. I had the privilege of introducing it in 1982. The rainbow Government reduced the bonus to 65% when it was stuck for cash. We brought it back up to 100% and it is once more a double payment.</P>

      <P>Workers at or below the average industrial wage will gain most. A further 79,000 low earners are being removed from the tax net and 57,000 taken off the higher rate. The Opposition states, &ldquo;Borrow, but do not use your own money.&rdquo; The Labour Party states it would look again at taxes on industry. In that case, let industry beware.</P>
      <P>The Opposition argues about the social insurance fund. It is very upset because there is money available from that source. We are providing for exceptional increases, but social assistance is also available and needs funds. We have acquired these funds by broadening the fund's base in which I was involved. We brought in everyone involved, such as the self-employed and farmers, and let them all contribute. We are now benefiting from the fact that most are contributing. As staff in the public sector are contributing, it is going to continue to be strong for the future. Let the economists realise this. They do not realise what is happening organically in our system which is strong and will continue to be. The fund will keep increasing. Our objective was to ensure everybody had two pensions, a State pension and an occupational pension.</P>
      <P>I am particularly proud, as Minister for Education and Science, to commend the budget of a Government which has increased the level of expenditure on education by a massive 92% since it came to office. This level of growth is unprecedented and has allowed us to make massive new investments in every major facet of education. Investment in education is a vital component of investment in our future to which the Government has demonstrated an unstinting commitment. Budget 2002 underlines and underpins this commitment. The budget additions bring the total gross provision for the education Votes to an unprecedented £5.4 billion for 2002, representing an increase of over 15% compared to the 2001 allocation. This unparalleled provision will allow us to make further significant investment in critical areas of education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The abridged Estimates for 2002, published in November, allowed for increased provision of a range of measures in education. This provision has been further enhanced by new measures announced in the budget, including an additional <Col N="64" /> 67.83 million to address the capital needs of first and second level schools. This brings the total capital allocation for education to over 600 million in 2002, an increase of 19% on the 2001 allocation, or over four times that provided in the 1997 Estimates. This will be welcomed by Members on the opposite side of the House because they are forever requesting more capital projects of me.</P>
    <P>Provision of 70 million has been made for supervision and substitution in 2002 while extra funding is available to provide 350 additional primary teachers and 200 additional secondary teachers in line with the PPF commitment. By 2002 the Government will have provided 3,000 extra teaching posts since taking office. An additional 10.25 million is being provided for a range of measures to assist pupils with disabilities and provide improved services in special education.</P>
    <P>An additional 5 million has been provided to allow for further development of skills programmes and research and development activities at third level, meaning that current expenditure on research and development in third level institutions will increase by 23%. These allocations are in addition to the significant increases in my Department's funding in the abridged Estimates which will allow me to make major improvements in education, especially for children with special needs, and provide for greater current and capital funding of schools.</P>
    <P>Among the measures provided for in 2002 is a substantial increase in <i>per capita</i> grants at primary and post primary levels. In addition, capital and capitation grants in respect of the 2001-02 school year are being brought forward to help schools with cash flow by means of a Supplementary Estimate before the end of 2001. There is also an increase of almost 70% in the provision for special needs assistants, including provision for 450 additional special needs assistants in schools. A 30% increase in the fund to improve access to third level education for those from disadvantaged backgrounds has been made. An additional 4 million has been provided to intensify efforts to ensure pupils complete their schooling, as has an additional 5 million for adult education and literacy initiatives. The funding provided for the expansion of the national education and psychological service has been increased by 19%.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increases in the education Votes there are a number of important aspects of the budget on which I would like to comment briefly. Last year the Government announced its intention to invest around £1 billion in increased child benefit over a three year period. Our central objective is to support parents in whatever choices they make in looking after their children. Child benefit is also an effective means of channelling money to low-income families as a way to tackle child poverty and enable children to gain more from their time in the classroom. In line with the record increases provided for last year, <Col N="65" /> the budget increases child benefit rates by a further £25 per month for the first and second children, to £92.62, and by £32 for a third and subsequent children, to £116. From next year a family with four children will receive £417 per month.</P>
    <P>The back to school clothing and footwear schemes have been improved and, as a result of the budget, from next year, more than 70,000 children aged 12 years and over will benefit from an increase in the payment rate to more than £94 a child. In addition, some 8,000 children will be eligible for this payment due to the easing of the means test.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 4, to delete &ldquo;1;&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>

      <P>(<i>b</i>) in the Irish language, is set out in <i>Part B </i>of that Schedule;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments seek to append the text of the 1995 and 1996 conventions in both Gaeilge and English to the Bill. Both the 1995 and 1996 conventions are equally authentic in the Irish and English languages. Therefore, the text of the conventions are being scheduled in Béarla agus Gaeilge. This takes account of the fact that it is not sufficient to have the Irish version translated at a later date because an Irish law does not have the same status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are scheduling the Irish and English versions of the convention for convenience and ease of reference only. I emphasise the conventions do not become part of the law of the State by virtue of being added as Schedules. I also point out that the text of both conventions were attached to the <Col N="66" /> explanatory memorandum. I propose to schedule both conventions to the Bill. Deputy Howlin's amendment wanted only the English version but I am sure he will agree to have Gaeilge agus Béarla attached.</P>

      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, bheinn an-sásta an leagan Gaeilge a bheith ar fáil más mian, and that is what the Minister of State has decided, that both the Irish and English texts will be appended to the Bill. We have managed to do something substantial in the first amendment, namely to more than double the length of the Bill, which is no mean achievement.</P>
      <P>There is an important point in this which I tried to make on Committee Stage, namely, for ease of reading the legislation, not only for practitioners but also for the public, we should make it as easy as possible to understand the law. In referring to conventions, it is not good enough to have them appended to the explanatory memorandum which, by definition and in practice, has a much shorter shelf life than the Bill will have when it becomes an Act and is on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>I am happy the suggestion I made on Committee Stage to have the English language version of the convention appended as a Schedule to the Bill has been accepted. I am also happy the Irish version will also be included in a second and different Schedule to the Bill. Obviously I am happy to support the amendment in my name.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 14, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;remanding that person on bail or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We debated this at length on Committee Stage. It is a very important issue. It gives an option to courts to remand on bail a person who consents to be extradited rather than requiring that he or she be incarcerated. That is the import of amendment No. 3. Amendment No. 4 is the same.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5, which is related although not identical, inserts a new subsection (9) which states, &ldquo;A person may not be remanded under this section or section 29 in custody for any period greater than 7 days&rdquo;. The first two amendments relate specifically to the issue of those individuals who consent to be extradited not necessarily being incarcerated and to have that option available to the courts. The third amendment ensures that, where there is incarceration, it does not last longer than seven days.</P>
      <P>We had an interesting debate on these matters on Committee Stage and I was not convinced by the response of the Minister of State. She said the amendment sought to allow a court the option of remanding a person on bail or committing such a person to prison and that, if the amendment were agreed, there would be serious implications for other sections and subsections of the 1965 Act.</P>
      <P>This is an important principle in law. I suspect it is something close to the beliefs of the Minister of State and certainly Members of the Opposition that the notion of incarceration should not be taken lightly and that no individual should be committed to prison unless there is a compelling reason to do so. The Minister argued on Committee Stage that one of the overriding reasons the Bill is drafted as it is and she could not accept the amendment I tabled was that allowing bail would entail the obvious risk, as she put it, of a person absconding, even though that person had agreed to be extradited in the first instance. I did not hear any compelling case for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have always argued, and the Supreme Court has found, that there is a constitutional right to liberty. We are talking about people who are the subject of extradition warrants who <i>prima facie</i> courts have said have a case to answer but are not found guilty of anything. Being found <i>prima facie</i> to have a case to answer does not mean a decision of guilt. We strive in this jurisdiction to keep people from being incarcerated unless they are convicted of a serious matter. I acknowledge that extradition warrants will not be issued for trivial matters. However, when a person faced with an extradition warrant consents to the proposal to extradite him or her, a facility should be available to the courts to make a deter<Col N="68" /> mination that the person can be granted bail. If my proposal is not acceptable to the Minister, she must answer a number of serious questions and convince the House about them. Why is there a compelling need to ensure incarceration in these instances? Why does the Minister believe there is a high probability, a very high risk, to use her words on Committee Stage, of such persons absconding? What evidence is there of that?</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister not allowing the courts discretion to make a determination on the face of the evidence and the individual circumstances of the case involved? Does she not trust the judges to determine, in all circumstances, where there is a likelihood or a very high risk of absconding? Can the Minister think of no circumstances where bail would be appropriate? If she can envisage such circumstances, why should we not provide for that possibility in the legislation? That, in essence, is my argument in favour of amendments Nos. 3 and 4.</P>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 5, if we are to hold people in custody we must have some finite period for which they can be lawfully detained. I am suggesting that seven days should be the greatest period allowable under section 6. If the Minister does not believe that seven days should be the extent of it, she should provide a compelling reason. I have re-read the Minister's comments on Committee Stage, but I can find no convincing argument why those reasonable improvements to the Bill cannot be acceded to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 seek to amend section 6 by allowing the court the option, when making an order against a person pending his handing up, of remanding that person on bail or committing such a person to prison. Section 6 inserts a new section 29A into the 1965 Act as it relates to convention countries only, that is, EU member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will return to this point in a moment but I wish to clarify a number of issues around it. A person who has been brought under extradition proceedings may be granted bail while the matter is still before the court. However, it has been the case since 1965 that once the court makes an order the person is remanded in custody pending an order for his surrender. It is normally the case that a remand is for seven days in custody at first hearing in the District Court, but section 29 of the 1965 Act provides that a period of 15 days is allowed before surrender, unless the person consents to go sooner. It is designed to allow the person to bring <i>habeas corpus </i>proceedings under Article 40 of the Constitution. Indeed, on making an order, the court informs the person of the provisions of the Constitution and if the person brings such proceedings the court, at its discretion, may grant bail while the application is being <Col N="69" /> heard. These arrangements have worked well since 1965 and I see no reason to change them now.</P>
    <P>As I stated on Committee Stage, the amendment would have implications beyond the current Bill because it would have the effect of introducing a two-tier system, one for the convention countries &ndash; the EU member states &ndash; inserted under section 29A and another for those cases to which the existing provisions of the 1965 Act still apply. I see no merit in having a two-tier system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to indicate that that would be an improvement to the way the system works in the courts because it is not supported by experience under the existing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 provides that a person cannot be remanded in custody for any period greater than seven days. This section deals with a situation where a person consented to be surrendered. Arrangements would be put in place for the surrender of the requested person and strict time limits apply. The 15-day period is set down before surrender. A person can bring an application for <i>habeas corpus</i> and may apply for bail under those proceedings. This provision continues to apply to cases covered by the new section 29A being inserted in the Bill.</P>
      <P>As in the previous case, this amendment would not necessarily introduce the two-tier system between EU member states and all others. I am not convinced, therefore, that there is merit in doing this. There does not appear to be evidence of a need to change the existing procedures. What is being proposed is in line with existing practice. I accept the danger of absconding in granting bail in extradition cases, but the same test is applied in other cases. It is for the State to show the probability of a person absconding if bail were to be granted. There is case law on that matter in the <i>People v Gilliat, 1985</i>. The provisions of the Bail Act do not apply to extradition cases so bail cannot be refused simply because there is a likelihood of further offences being committed while on bail. The State would have to show the probability of a person absconding if bail were to be granted, but the safeguards are there so that a person would not be held for longer than 15 days. Should the person decide to opt for the existing proceedings bail can be provided, as well as under the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why anybody bothers to argue in favour of an amendment on Report Stage if none of the arguments is addressed in the reply. The Minister read a prepared response to arguments I did not make. I would like her to address the four questions I posed concerning <Col N="70" /> these matters. The whole idea of having a Legislature is to examine laws and see how to improve them as society's values change. While not all these matters are set in stone, personal liberty is generally treasured. There is a strong view, which may be more libertarian here than in other countries, that people should not be incarcerated unless there are compelling reasons for doing so. That is my view and it is shared strongly by the Irish people. Other jurisdictions, including other EU states, are much more likely to incarcerate even their own citizens than we are.</P>
      <P>Thankfully, we have a relatively small prison population. I am taken aback, however, when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform boasts that he has added 2,000 prison places. I do not see it as a great triumph for our society that we can lock up more of our citizens, particularly when a large proportion of those in jail are there for non-payment of debt. We should look at who is being incarcerated and examine the reasons for their incarceration.</P>
      <P>The former Fine Gael spokesperson on justice, Deputy Jim Higgins, produced a remarkable body of work on the issue of restorative justice. He produced a wonderful report for the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, containing proposals for dealing with offenders in a more practical, humane and progressive way.</P>
      <P>The Minister should justify the view that people should be locked up. She will not even allow a court the right to release people on bail if that court determines there is no fear or probability of absconding. She will not allow for that probability. The defence she has recited for us today is that an Act of the Oireachtas of 35 years standing has an impact on non-convention countries that cannot be dislodged after 35 years by a more progressive attitude taken here today. That sets parliamentary democracy on its head. If the view is that we have made a decision that had implications for countries in 1965 that cannot be dislodged by a revision of our views in 2001-02 then we can never reform legislation. I have a principled view, which I share with my party and which is probably shared by a majority of people, that we should not incarcerate people without good reason. I am of the view that we lock up too many people here, but that is an aside in relation to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are dealing with here is the issue of extradition and the processes that we, within the European Union in applying the EU conventions, allow for citizens of this State to be extradited to other EU countries. The first principle is that a <i>prima facie</i> case will have to be established in an Irish court. Heretofore it had to be established in the District Court. Under the new regime that will be put in place, following the enactment of this legislation, that initial decision will be made in the High Court. I suggest, once that determination is made, not that somebody is guilty of an offence because that is not what the High Court is asked to do in these procedures, but simply that <Col N="71" /> there is a <i>prima facie</i> case to be answered and that extradition is warranted under the law and under the European conventions. If the courts determine that it is appropriate, the option should be available to that court to allow bail. That is a simple principle. I heard no counter argument to that from the Minister of State. The argument that it would create a divergence of treatment between non-EU and EU countries is irrelevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, let us make progress slowly, if we cannot do it comprehensively. That would be preferable to making no progress at all. That is not an argument. Has the Minister of State abandoned the absconding argument made on Committee Stage because it was not made today. If the Minister of State suggests there is a high rate of people absconding, I ask her to make the case. She quotes case law but it is within the ability of the High Court, under the provisions I suggest should be inserted in the Bill, to make a value judgment. If it was the view of the learned judge that there was a high risk of people absconding, he or she would not allow bail. Without wishing to take up too much time because we are in a truncated debate, the principle of liberty is extremely important.</P>
      <P>I had hoped the Minister of State would address valid arguments from this side which have some merit and not come in with a prepared script. It does not harm the extradition process to allow for bail for a category of people who have volunteered to be extradited and who have been determined by the High Court to have a <i>prima facie</i> case to answer and extradition is in process. Why is it necessary to make it mandatory that such individuals be held in custody?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Howlin is correct. Recent research has shown that Irish people have moved away from the concept of putting people in prison. They want restorative justice. The concept of creating more prison spaces is not what the people want. The Bill, as drafted, ties the hand of the judge. Can the Minister of State envisage any case where bail may be appropriate? If the amendment were accepted it would not fundamentally change the Bill but would give a certain discretion to the judge.</P>

More importantly, Deputy Howlin appears to hold the view that if people agree to be extradited they almost walk in off the side of the street and say they agree. Some of these <Col N="72" /> people may be in custody or may have been arrested and when put to them that there are extradition proceedings they then agree to go. That does not necessarily mean they volunteer to head to these countries. The risk of absconding is high.</P>

      <P>Should they decide to avail of the opportunity of the time lag of 15 days to go down the <i>habeas corpus</i> route, the bail proceedings would be available to them. Merely because they agree to a request for extradition does not mean they sit around waiting for it to happen and volunteer to go. The present system has worked well. The safeguard is available for them in that there are limited timescales under which the necessary documentation and orders have to be made. They have that protection. That somebody agrees to it is not an indication that the law should be changed. The same risks apply to the person who agrees and the person who does not agree.</P>

      <P>This is my last interjection. The Minister of State has refused to address any of the issues. I asked a simple question, namely, can the Minister of State envisage no circumstance where the granting of bail would be appropriate? She has turned my argument on its head. In her last interjection she said there are categories of people who should not be allowed bail. I have no difficulty accepting that. The import of what I want is simply to allow a provision for bail where bail would be appropriate but the Bill precludes that option from being available to the High Court. That is my difficulty. If the Minister of State and her officials cannot envisage any circumstance in which bail might be appropriate then there might be some logic in her stance. If she concedes there may be an occasion when the option should be available to the court &ndash; not compulsorily available &ndash; she should accept the amendment.</P>

That is the rule whereby a person expedited for one offence may not be tried for other offences committed before his or her extradition. The 1995 convention provides that consent or renunciation may not be revoked but allows parties to opt out of this requirement by making a declaration to that effect on ratification.

In all areas dealing with justice matters I do not find it acceptable that substantial new issues are introduced on Report Stage. This is not the worst example by any stretch of the imagination. In some Bills dealing with asylum seekers and refugee issues enormous complicated changes of the law were introduced on Report Stage that were not debated on Second or Committee Stages. As a matter of principle, we should try not to do this because it is not open to the Opposition to deal with new issues that do not arise out of Committee Stage proceedings. This is not a great way of dealing with issues because we have a limited opportunity to scrutinise amendments.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> Deputy Howlin proposes to substitute the existing paragraph (<i>b</i>) of section 20(1). Paragraph (<i>b</i>) provides for the replacement of references to the Circuit Court by the Supreme Court. Instead the Deputy proposes the deletion of section 29(5), that is, that no appeal shall lie against an order of the Supreme &ndash; Circuit &ndash; Court under this section. Section 47(5) contains a similar provision.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the 1965 Act provides that no appeal shall lie against a decision of the court committing the person to prison there to await the order of the Minister for his extradition. However, section 29(3) provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the court shall inform the person of the provisions of section 4.2 of Article 40 of the Constitution, which relates to the making of a complaint to the High Court by or on behalf of any person alleging that the person is detained, therefore, <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings, and that provides a major safeguard for the arrested person.</P>
    <P>The issue of a right of appeal to the Supreme Court has been addressed by the Supreme Court. In Holohan and Donoghue, 1984, the Supreme Court held that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear appeals from the decisions of the High Court derives from Article 34.4 of the Constitution, and any exception or regulation by law of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction must be unambiguously stated.</P>
    <P>The matter was considered again in Hanafin and the Minister for the Environment on 1 March 1996.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a happy coincidence. The determination of this issue involved a consideration of the terms of Article 34.4.3º of the Constitution which provides that the Supreme Court shall, with such exceptions and subject to such regulations that may be prescribed by law, have appellate jurisdiction from all decisions of the High Court. The court found that the provisions of Article 34.4.3º of the Constitution clearly envisage and provide for exceptions to the general right of appeal from decisions of the High Court to the Supreme Court and, furthermore, provide for the regulation of such right by an Act of the Oireachtas. It is open to the Legislature, therefore, to exclude certain decisions of the High Court from the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. However, this can only be restricted by legislation clearly intended to have that effect.</P>
      <P>A number of Acts of the Oireachtas accept and regulate the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. For example, section 132(6) of the Electoral Act, 1992, provides that any party to a petition may appeal on a question of law to the Supreme Court against a decision of the High Court on the petition and, subject to the foregoing, the decision of the High Court shall be final and not open to appeal. Section 57(8) of the Presidential Elections Act, 1993, is in similar vein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> Nevertheless, we must ensure that the avenues of appeal are not unduly restricted. I propose, therefore, that a right of appeal on a point of law from the High Court to the Supreme Court should be expressly provided for. I am satisfied that this, together with the <i>habeas corpus</i> provisions I referred to earlier, will provide all the safeguards necessary. This new avenue of appeal on points of law was not provided for previously. The proposal in the Bill, with my amendments, meet the requirement for clarity that the Supreme Court requires in the cases I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at a very important stage in the debate. I compliment the Minister of State for putting a gloss on what she is proposing, which is a considerable delimiting of the rights of appeal available to individuals in these circumstances over the <i>status quo</i>. The Minister quoted the case in which there was a requirement for specificity in relation to the rights of the Supreme Court to specifically examine appeals from the High Court, but she intends to delimit those rights to merely a point of law. It would be helpful if we examined the <i>status quo</i> to see what would prevail should the measures proposed by the Minister be enacted.</P>
      <P>As of now, as I understand it, an application for an extradition warrant is made to the District Court. The District Court makes an order and carries out its own analysis of the merits of the case to determine whether an order is appropriate. Assuming the District Court decides that there is merit in the case and an order is made by the District Court, the individual affected has, as of now, three avenues to consider. Under the provisions of the Constitution he can, as the Minister of State rightly said, apply for <i>habeas corpus</i>, which only applies to an evaluation by the High Court of the legality of the detention. He can apply for judicial review, which is an overview by the High Court of the correctness of the mechanisms followed to date or he can, under section 50 of the existing Act, that is the parent Act of 1965, make an application to the High Court to have a determination made on the nature of the offence for which the person is to be extradited, for example, is it political, was there undue delay, or any other legal matter that is covered under section 50 of the 1965 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is included in that overview is a fairly intensive examination of the facts and, in some areas, a wider overview and examination of the facts than that which took place in the District Court. Following all that, there is an option to appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law. In the current situation, points of fact could be determined even on this further appeal to the Supreme Court. That is an explanation, in my inadequate, non-legal way, of the safeguards that exist currently, and when one considers the attention extradition laws got in this House when the legislation was being debated, even in my time, which is not that long, but certainly in your time, <Col N="79" /> Sir, there were major tensions in this House on the issue of extradition where Members thought the notion of an Irish citizen being extradited to another jurisdiction was among the most momentous for which this House could legislate. We have a reasonably broad structure to ensure that is not done lightly and that there are avenues of appeal and overview available to us, as I have outlined.</P>
    <P>What will the new model be and what will the Minister's proposals and the amendments she has put forward amount to? The court of instigation will be the High Court rather than the District Court. The High Court, as the court of first instance, will make an order and, in the course of making that order, it will consider the section 50 issues, which I indicated would be considered in the High Court under the second tier of examination in the existing legislative framework. After the High Court has made its determination, as the court of first appeal, the <i>habeas corpus</i> route will still be available, but that is limited to an evaluation of the legality of the imprisonment or the detention. There is no judicial review because the High Court, traditionally, does not review itself. The only appeal, in accordance with the amendment the Minister is now proposing, is to the Supreme Court on a point of law, so it is a much neater system. It is a considerable delimiting of the rights of overview and appeal that exist currently. There is no gloss on that. That is a fact.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State believes this is the right course of action, she should explain that to us but she should not pretend, as I discerned in her initial contribution, that the new system has as many safeguards as the old one. That is the argument the Minister attempted to make on Committee Stage when she argued that the appeal process to the Supreme Court from the High Court was analogous to the appeal process from the District Court to the High Court under the existing legislation when patently that is not the case.</P>
    <P>This is a very important part of the legislation. I have serious doubts that we are doing the right thing and I want to hear compelling arguments from the Minister that there are sufficient safeguards and that this rationalising of the options open to an individual, subject to an extradition order, are entirely merited.</P>

      <P>Deputy Howlin's outline of the current position as regards the District Court and the High Court is correct. The reason the appeals were written in for the High Court was to provide the protection of the High Court to ensure lawful orders are made. Because the High Court is the court of first instance, persons have that protection. They will also continue to have the protection of <i>habeas corpus</i>, which has not been limited in any way.</P>

      <P>This is a useful point at which to examine exactly what is involved in extradition cases. They are not criminal cases or investigations because consideration is given only to issues of procedure, fact and compliance with the law. Appeals on a point of law will address issues of procedure and fact. The court will not make a judgment on the merits of the case or the guilt of the person. It must satisfy itself that procedures have been complied with and the relevant documentation has been provided by another State. There is no question of undertaking a huge investigation into the facts of the case.</P>
      <P>The Bill expressly provides for a right of appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law. As a right which did not exist heretofore, it will be an added protection. It is most likely contrary to the judicial process to appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of fact. Whereas in the past, one moved from the District Court to the High Court to seek its protection, one now starts off with the protection of the High Court. Once the orders have been made, one can still use the <i>habeas corpus</i> provision and, in addition, one has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I only have two minutes. The bottom line is that amendment No. 12 states: &ldquo;(5) No appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from an order of the High Court under this section, except on a point of law.&rdquo; The Minister of State talked about procedure under the 1965 Act. Will she give a reassurance that the Supreme Court will be able to examine a point of law in its broadest sense? Does &ldquo;a point of law&rdquo; mean that all the issues covered in section 50 of the 1965 Act, such as &ldquo;inordinate delay&rdquo; and the political nature of the offence, are open to examination by the Supreme Court in an appeal? These are not what I understand to be points of law. If this is the case, all the relevant issues will be determined in a single hearing.</P>
      <P>The <i>habeas corpus</i> procedures, as I have acknowledged, are constitutional and pertain only to the legality of detention. No matter what gloss one puts on this, it substantially restricts the right of individuals to avail of existing appeal and overview procedures. The logic of the Minister of State's statement is that everything will now take place in a one-stop-shop in the High Court and that because the High Court will get it right in one go, a second look at the matter is not needed. The proposals severely restrict the right of appeal in our system of law, which ensures that all court decisions are subject to review by another court. I am not a lawyer, but I would like much stronger reassurance from the Minister of State.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 10 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 4 to 11.</P>
      <P>This amendment addresses the same issues as the previous one, namely, the appeals processes available to people who are subject to extradition. At present, as I explained earlier, the District Court makes an extradition order and the person concerned may then apply to the High Court or to the Minister for a release under section 50 of the Extradition Act, 1965. If he does so within 15 days of the order he cannot be bundled out of the country and must wait for the result. The same applies to the procedure of <i>habeas corpus</i>. The Minister, in this Bill, wishes to restrict that procedure to <i>habeas corpus</i> applications only. This is because she must allow for the mechanism of <i>habeas corpus</i> as it is provided for in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The reason, as I said on Committee Stage, we have an Extradition Act, 1965, is that in 1965 the Supreme Court criticised the swift bundling of people over the Border without a chance to challenge their removal legally. In Part 4, section 20, the Minister wants to restrict the current right of appeal under section 50, currently available as an appeal to the High Court, and to have the right of appeal only under <i>habeas corpus</i>, which is an overview in the High Court of the legality or the legitimacy of the detention. I do not want to trample over all the ground I covered in the previous set of amendments because the issues are related. It simply means that the new regime being introduced by the Minister will severely delimit the right of individuals to have a decision considered a second time.</P>
      <P>Up to now the initial decision was made on the basis of the facts and the law by the District Court and the option of appeal was available either under section 50 to the High Court, where all the issues now to be considered in the first instance would be considered, or a judicial review, or <i>habeas corpus</i>. When all that was exhausted there was the possibility of an appeal, even on points of fact, to the Supreme Court. As has been pointed out, the Supreme Court has a particular obligation and right to consider constitutional matters. All that is to be truncated. Now there will be simply a High Court decision and an appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law, a narrow point of law, as the Minister has finally accepted. As the Minister cannot smash down the option of a <i>habeas corpus</i> application, which is in the Constitution, it will be allowed for under this section where an application is made within 15 days of the order. I propose simply to delete that section.</P>

      <P>What is being removed is the cross-reference to it because the cases no longer start at the District Court. These matters are now dealt with, in the first instance, in the High Court. It is important to look at what section 50 does. It sets out the issues the High Court may consider in any case referred to it from the District Court, including whether the offence to which the warrant relates is a political offence for extradition purposes or an offence under military law, whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the warrant was issued for the purpose of persecuting a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion or whether, due to a lapse of time, it would be unjust to deliver the person up. The High Court will release the person if it considers that any of these apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> With regard to alleged political offences and claims of likely persecution, because section 50 of the 1965 Act gives the High Court jurisdiction over such matters it appeared that they would not be investigated by the District Court. However, the reference in section 48 to section 50 was applicable only because cases began in the District Court and section 48 allowed an application to be made in the High Court to have these matters considered. No changes are being made to the existing provisions of section 50. Those protections are still there. The cross-reference initially referred to cases coming from the District Court to be reviewed by the High Court &ndash; because cases now start in the High Court, there is no further need for it. The High Court will now give consideration to all these matters in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete lines 21 to 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with section 21 of the Bill, the laying of orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am at a slight disadvantage in that I am still working off my initiated text which has different references. It basically deals with procedures. Under the proposal in section 2 every order made by the Government under this Bill after the commencement of the Extradition (European Union Conventions) Act, 2001, shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such <Col N="86" /> House within the next 21 days on which that House sits after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder. That is the section the Minister intends including.</P>
    <P>There are two ways in which resolutions of this House have effect. One is to require the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas by way of confirmatory motion, which is the <i>status quo</i> in this case and it is the more involved way for the House. The second mechanism is for an annulling order to be made and that is the procedure suggested here. I suggest that the former mechanism is a more democratic one for an issue of such importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 21 seeks to address a major difficulty with the operation of section 4 of the Extradition Act, 1965. This arises in connection with multilateral agreements which contain extradition provisions. It is a difficulty that was not foreseen when the current provision was inserted in 1987. What is now being proposed in section 21 of this Bill is to return to the pre-1987 position.</P>
      <P>The issue has two aspects, the first relates to our accession to international agreements and the second and more difficult issue arises as new states accede to agreements and thereby impose obligations on Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> those new parties to the agreement. When Ireland ratifies a multilateral convention which contains obligations relating to extradition, it must ensure that it can comply with these obligations before the convention enters into force for Ireland. Under multilateral conventions, the period between ratification and bringing the extradition provisions into effect tends to be short, typically 30 days.</P>
      <P>Under section 4 of the Extradition Act, to allow for extradition between Ireland and another state which is party to the agreement, it is necessary for an extradition order to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. This must be done after the State becomes a party to the agreement, but before the agreement enters into force for Ireland. This can generally be managed through the normal scheduling of parliamentary business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent orders, necessary to take into account the State's obligations to other states that become party to the agreement after its entry into force for this State, must be made between the date such a state becomes party to the agreement and the date the agreement enters into force for it. Those subsequent orders bring into force the extradition provisions of the agreement as they apply between Ireland and the new parties that have most recently acceded to the agreement. Failure to bring those provisions into force in Irish law on time means Ireland is not in a position to meet its obligations to the new parties to the agreement under the extradition provisions of the agreement. As I mentioned earlier, many agreements allow only 30 days between accession <Col N="87" /> by a party to an agreement and the bringing into force of the extradition provisions.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that the current requirement poses a problem. A new party may accede to an agreement on 1 August, for example, and the extradition aspects would be due to be operational by 1 September. Under current procedure and practice, Ireland cannot meet those deadlines. Even outside the recess periods, it may be difficult to find parliamentary time at short notice to pass motions within the timeframe required. What is more relevant is that the Houses may not be sitting. I have checked and understand that it would be outside the scope of parliamentary committees to deal with it. There are a number of different agreements that can arise. The important thing is to state that the timeframe by which we pass the motions and the number of motions is dictated by other parties &ndash; it is by the accession of other countries or parties to the agreements. The timeframe is outside our control and deadlines are placed on us by other people.</P>
    <P>It is equally important to recognise that any agreement which would have been entered into would have been discussed here in the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas would have had the chance to examine the agreements because legislation would have to have been introduced to give effect to them. The agreements would have been discussed here and the making of the extradition orders would be subsequent to that and only within a timeframe when another country would enter into the convention. It would still be the case that a motion would appear on the Order Paper of the House and that could be annulled within the 21 days. I know Deputy Howlin thinks this is a negative rather than a positive motion but he should bear in mind that it is not something new to the House. We would have already discussed the legislation leading to the ratification of the conventions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept some of the points made by the Minister but there is a straightforward principle involved here and that is the primacy of the Houses of the Oireachtas to ensure that orders made have the consent of the House. The main reason given by the Minister of State is administrative convenience. I know from my time working on the justice committee that it would be administratively convenient if this House did not exist as far as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is concerned. We could hand over our seals and they could just stamp away regardless of anything else. With respect, that is how the Department treats us with information on important issues which often arrives late. Even the Executive sometimes gets short shrift from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Houses of the Oireachtas are to carry out their duty properly, it can often be administratively cumbersome and inconvenient. We might have to look to our own sitting arrangements to <Col N="88" /> deal with these matters. Perhaps our breaks are overly long and perhaps we need different plenary arrangements for sitting. By and large it is not a good idea, because it is inconvenient or discommoding sometimes to require parliamentary approval for orders that are important, that we should simply remove the requirement so that something goes on the schedule of the orders of the House and is probably never seen by the majority. In principle it is not a good thing and I want to press my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unfair to say that it was for administrative convenience given that the Oireachtas will have already discussed and scrutinised all aspects of the agreement which will then give rise to extradition procedures. What is important is that having signed these agreements we would then be in a position to meet our obligations under them. Often the timeframe in meeting those obligations, through no fault of our own as it is set for us by outside parties, is very short. It is to ensure that we can meet our obligations where there are extradition proceedings arising out of conventions and agreements that we have already discussed in full in this House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) If a person whose extradition is sought serves a notice to cross-examine the person whose affidavit or statement is furnished as provided for in subsection (1) herein, on any matter referred to in such affidavit or statement, such person shall give oral evidence on the matters contained in the affidavit or statement and be subject to cross-examination.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with section 22(2) of the Bill which currently outlines that the High Court may, if it considers that the interests of justice so require, direct that oral evidence of the matters described in the affidavit or statement concerned be given. This was discussed in committee at length and the genesis of the point I am making for the inclusion of this amendment is that it gives the individual facing an extradition order an opportunity to cross-examine a witness or the evidence put forward in the affidavit. In the interest of natural justice the Minister should accept it. It is very straightforward. The amendment would add to the Bill. I cannot see how it would take from it or what difficulties it would cause. On Committee Stage the Minister promised to reflect <Col N="89" /> on the matter for Report Stage. I know there was some difficulty but the Minister agreed to reflect and I hope that reflection will have a positive outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We had some debate on this on Committee Stage on foot of amendments tabled by me and others. There is a straightforward principle involved &ndash; it has been highlighted to me by my involvement in the committees and sub-committees of the House &ndash; that is, the right of individuals to cross-examine deponents of affidavits or those who make statements. I have great concern with evidence by affidavit or certificate that cannot be subject to cross-examination. By definition, one cannot cross-examine a piece of paper. In normal proceedings an affidavit cannot be used for a hearing without leave of a court if a party gives notice of a desire to cross-examine the deponent. I understand there is a constitutional right to cross-examine an opponent, a right under the European Convention on Human Rights. This section makes any cross-examination utterly dependent on the court's view. Amendment No. 15 in my name would simply insert the normal and usual rule which is essential to protect this right.</P>
      <P>I argued the case as best I could on Committee Stage and I thought the Minister of State was moving towards acceptance of my view. I am concerned that we might introduce a frailty to the Bill by running over or close to the boundary of permissibility under the Constitution or the convention. I hope I will not need to argue the case for much longer because the Minister of State will have reflected and accept the amendment. It grieves me a little that there is no amendment in the Minister's name on the matter.</P>

      <P>At the time I agreed to reflect on this matter I indicated that I was willing to facilitate other amendments, which I did on amendment No. 1, but was unsure about these ones. During the week I reflected, took advice from the Attorney General and examined the Constitution and procedures, and regret I cannot accept these amendments.</P>
      <P>The background to the inclusion of the current provision is that the Office of the Attorney General took the view that it would be appropriate to provide in legislation for the introduction of evidence in the relevant court by way of affidavit. There is no provision in legislation for affidavits of facts to be used and it only contemplates admissibility of the warrant, verifying affidavit and certificate. In some cases it has been found necessary to introduce evidence by way of affidavit, for example, to establish the necessary correspondence of offences. The Bill, therefore, provides for affidavit evidence in extradition proceedings unless the court sees good reason to the contrary. In effect, the Bill will ensure the existing practice regarding affidavits may be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential point is that the section does not require the giving of evidence by affidavit, but <Col N="90" /> allows it. The provision in the Bill gives the High Court discretion, if it considers that the interests of justice so require, to allow for oral evidence of the matters described in the affidavit. This is not an unfettered discretion as the courts cannot act in an unreasonable or capricious manner. If a person whose surrender is being sought asks to be permitted to cross-examine a witness, since such a right appears to exist under Article 40.3 of the Constitution, the High Court has no option but to give a direction under subsection (2). The court has an inherent duty to ensure the person's constitutional rights are protected and the proposed subsection (7)(<i>b</i>)(ii) being inserted in the Bill acknowledges this.</P>
    <P>I am of the view that the current wording of the Bill provides adequate safeguards for all parties to extradition proceedings and that the change supports the principle of improving the efficiency of the court process. I will not, therefore, support the amendments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin referred to the constitutional right to cross-examine. Article 38.1 gives the right to cross-examine in criminal cases, although extradition cases do not fall into that category. In other proceedings, such as extradition, Article 40.3 can be relied on to give a right to cross-examine because it protects a person's good name. It is accepted, therefore, that liberty would probably be a right protected by it. Such a right need not be provided for in the Bill because it is already provided for in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We are both saying that it should be left to the High Court. The Government states that this ought to be in the interests of justice and while Deputy Howlin is approaching the matter from another angle, he is also saying that there cannot be cross-examination where notice is served without leave of the High Court. We both say that the High Court must give leave and acknowledge that the interests of justice are considered by it. The Government states that the affidavit can be relied on while the Deputy says that it cannot. We are satisfied that constitutional provisions ensure the right is provided for, but we are not saying that the State shall rely on or require evidence by affidavit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>In a nutshell, the Minister of State is saying that the amendments we seek are already catered for under Article 40.3 of the Constitution, but does she agree that it would be helpful if this right was made explicit in the Bill? Someone not familiar with other aspects of law, perhaps acting on his or her own behalf, would be assisted if it was made explicit in the Bill. How would it take from the Bill to include it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State now accepts that cross-examination is a constitutional right on which she is not at odds with me. On Committee Stage she relied on rules of court to argue for the existence of such a right. I had hoped to receive a copy of those rules so as to understand them. I agree with Deputy Timmins that it is more cor<Col N="91" /> rect, as the Minister of State accepts that the person affected by affidavit or certificate evidence should be able to cross-examine the deponent, to make this explicit in the Bill. It would be no great burden and I do not understand the reason this is not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>We all accept that cross-examination is not permitted just for its own sake. It must be relevant to the issue before the court and in the interests of justice. The effect of this section will be to require oral evidence and cross-examination where required in the interests of justice. If we were to accept the amendment, we would oblige the High Court to hear oral evidence even where it was not satisfied that this was necessary in the interests of justice. This is not desirable or in keeping with the procedures governing courts. It would be wrong to give an automatic right to require the attendance of a deponent when it may not be clear if the interests of justice would be served.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I referred to the rules of superior courts, of which Order 40, Rule 1, Statutory Instrument No. 15, 1986, states, &ldquo;Upon any petition, motion or other application evidence may be given by affidavit but the court may, on the application of either party, order the attendance for cross-examination of the person making any such affidavit.&rdquo; I rely on the fact the Articles 38.1 and 40.3 of the Constitution protect the right to cross-examination. To provide for it in the Bill would be to provide for it as of right, even where this may not be required in the interests of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget brought forward this year by the Minister for Finance is an attempt to buy the next general election in 2002 by extracting money from various sources like the social insurance fund and the Central Bank and by asking the businesses to pay their tax in the current year and still expect people to be in business at the end of it.</P>
      <P>The background to the budget was clearly indicated in the White Paper on expenditure and receipts, which showed there would be a deficit. Following the rapid fall off in income tax receipts, particularly in the second half of 2001, it was inevitable there would be financial difficulties in the years ahead and the Minister has predicted deficits of £2.3 billion in 2003 and £3 billion in 2004. We must add a rider to the credibility of the Minister for Finance in relation to the figures because, in his Budget Statement of last year, he also predicted he would have £4 billion more in 2001 in income tax receipts following the measures he took then and this would help to pay for the public services so that there would be a surplus at the end of this year. Receipts in income tax for 2001 are £3.5 billion worse than the Minister estimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> Even though there were signs and warnings there would be a fall-off in economic activity in 2001, he proceeded relentlessly to ignore the advice he got from his Department officials, the ERSI and many other commentators. In a manner typical of the Minister for Finance, he just ploughed on regardless and made his own decision, which has resulted in the country being £3.5 billion worse off than it was a year ago. It is a remarkable record.</P>
    <P>There has been a 23% increase in public expenditure and many people want to know where the money has gone. How has the boom been squandered? Why is a blueprint for a health service required after four and a half years in Government with huge financial resources available to the Minister?</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has done more U-turns than any Minister in the history of the State. The Minister for Finance had to bail him out again yesterday by reintroducing mortgage interest relief and changing stamp duty rates. These actions are completely at variance with the provisions of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2000, and recommended in the Bacon report, which contributed significantly to the rapid fall-off in house construction in 2001. The public capital programme for local authority house building was so badly managed by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, that fewer new local authority houses were started in 2001 than ever before. This has resulted in the Minister for Finance again having to bail out the Minister for the Environment and Local Government with an additional £146 million.</P>
    <P>When it comes to better local government, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government lauds the importance of implementing this strategy by appointing directors and promoting senior executive officers throughout the country. He then refuses to give local authorities the money to implement the budgetary and financial position of ensuring those people are paid what he intended them to be paid in his publication Better Local Government. The result is that local authorities throughout the country are grappling with their Estimates for 2002 to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>To add insult to injury the Minister was unable to implement waste management plans with the co-operation of local and regional authorities throughout the country and then he took the power away from local authority members and gave it to the county managers. As a local authority member when he came to office, the Minister claimed he would devolve more power from the centre to the local authorities, but what has he done? He has taken more of it away.</P>
    <P>U-turn Noel, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, will be known as a man who kicked every balloon up in the air with great hope but, unfortunately, each came down in a ball of smoke. This is best exemplified in his housing policy. Although it is laudable to ensure the less well off who cannot afford <Col N="130" /> to buy homes on the open market are looked after, the construction industry and people involved in local authorities know how impractical this measure is.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has been praised for the 30% increase in expenditure in the second half of 2001, which has not happened before. There has been an attempt to massage the figures just like the Haughey style economics we had in the 1980s. I did not think the Minister for Finance would resort to that school of thought in drawing up this budget, but regrettably that seems to be the case. The Government will not get away with the three-card trick that has been played on the people and after the election we will have to pay for it in 2003 and beyond. The style of Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats accountancy, which has been pulled like a rabbit out of a hat to get us over the election, will be seen for what it is by the people at the polls in 2002.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on many local projects in my constituency was promised, including the Kilkenny hospital plan, a ring road extension and the major motorway through Carlow-Kilkenny that is badly needed. All these have now been put back because the capital programme has been raided by the Minister to make up for the splurge of finance without the necessary rewards for the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister was unable to tell me when the national spatial strategy would be implemented to ensure we have a desired devolution of private and public enterprise in all the regions. The <i>per capita </i>income in the south-east region has been reducing over the past five years and the opportunity, which was presented to us by decentralisation and the national spatial strategy, has again been put on the long finger until after the election because the Minister for Finance is unable to make a decision.</P>
    <P>The opportunity presented to the Minister for Finance has been manipulated and massaged for the purposes of political expediency and I regret he has resorted to those tactics.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <Quest>when he will introduce a noise standard, particularly in relation to areas adjacent to traffic routes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The identification of works to be carried out on newly constructed or improved roads to mitigate the effects of road traffic noise is car<Col N="131" /> ried out as part of the environmental impact assessment process for relevant projects. Forecasts of road noise levels are included in all environmental impact statements for major road schemes. Objections can be made to proposed road developments on the grounds of the potential impact of increased noise, including at an oral hearing held by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>In approving road projects, it is open to the board to require modifications in relation, <i>inter alia</i>, to noise mitigation and in the past such modifications have been imposed as required. In view of the comprehensive nature of this approach, the activation of regulations, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, under section 77 of the Roads Act, 1993, in relation to noise mitigation on newly constructed or improved roads has not to date been considered necessary and I do not propose to make such regulations.</P>
      <P>EU legislation transposed into Irish law sets standards for permissible sound levels and exhaust systems on new motor vehicles. The Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, require that vehicles should be fitted with a silencer or other device suitable for reducing to a reasonable level noise caused by the escape of exhaust gases from the engine and prohibits use of a vehicle which causes any excessive noise in a public place. An assessment is also made concerning the effectiveness of the silencer in reducing exhaust related noise, as far as is reasonable, as part of the roadworthiness tests for heavy and light goods vehicles and private cars.</P>
      <P>Future noise policy will be guided by a new EU directive on the assessment and management of environmental noise. This would require, <i>inter alia</i>, the mapping of noise, using harmonised noise indicators from sources including transport, major roads, railways, airports and industry and the drawing up and publication of strategic action plans to manage noise issues and effects. The Council of Environment Ministers agreed this proposal in June 2001 and it is now being considered by the European Parliament. The requirements involved will be duly implemented in Ireland following final agreement at EU level. I understand Dublin Corporation has already commenced work on noise mapping. The proposed directive does not set or require the setting of environmental noise standards and I do not have any plans at present to specify these.</P>

      <P>It is my understanding that if a group of residents challenges noise levels, we do not have a standard against which to measure them and that we frequently refer to the British standard which is not binding in this country. Does the Minister of State agree it is important to have a benchmark against which we can measure noise levels? Many residents find it difficult to cope with the increased noise levels in certain areas from road construction and increased traffic <Col N="132" /> volumes. Will the Minister of State address the issue of car and house alarms in built up areas? What is the procedure for dealing with such infringements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland does not yet experience the same level of noise pollution as mainland Europe, but increased prosperity, additional traffic, higher density and urban in-fill housing development are increasing noise pressures, especially on urban dwellers. National statutory noise standards may not be the most appropriate step to take. Acceptable levels of noise vary greatly depending on a range of factors. In an industrial area the level of noise can be higher than in residential or mixed areas. Traffic noise on urban roads may need more careful control than on a rural stretch of motorway. Outdoor noise may be higher than that indoors. Extensive measures are taken to reduce noise where necessary. For example, increased distances from housing and the inclusion of mounds to deflect noise or plants to absorb noise are incorporated from the design stage, as necessary. If there are complaints about traffic noise following the opening of the road to traffic, these can be investigated and noise mitigation measures carried out as appropriate.</P>

      <Quest>the main features of the agreement he reached with the Irish Farmers' Association regarding increased compensation for farmers whose land is compulsorily acquired under the national road plan; the estimated additional cost of the agreement; if the new terms will apply to land or property owners, other than farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I concluded a proposed final agreement with the Irish Farmers' Association aimed at resolving the issues surrounding access to farmland for the national roads programme. Authorisation for the proposed agreement is now being arranged by the IFA and the National Roads Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement provides local authorities with earlier and speedier access to land for the purposes of national road construction than is now possible under CPO procedures. This early access <Col N="133" /> is a significant advantage for the national roads programme as design, investigation and acquisition are now carried out in parallel rather than sequentially as in the past. The IFA is pledged to build support for farmer co-operation in relation to access and the overall agreement. In return for this co-operation from landowners, the NRA or, as appropriate, local authorities, will pay a premium of 5,000 per acre in addition to assessed compensation; assess the market value of land by reference to the value of the actual land parcel on a stand alone basis rather than as part of the whole farm; provide replacement farm buildings and take over responsibility for fencing on all new national roads under the programme; pay compensation for damage and disturbance caused by site investigation works, including disturbance to livestock, crops, etc.; speed up administration of land acquisition with a view to earlier processing and payment of cases, with additional interest to be paid by local authorities or the NRA where deadlines are not met; prepare a code of practice containing guidance aimed at ensuring better liaison and communication with farmers affected; facilitate liaison with farmers in relation to the new agreement and work with a joint committee, which will also comprise farming interests, to oversee its implementation.</P>
    <P>The estimated extra cost of the 5,000 premium is in the range of 100 million to 125 million spread over the period of the NDP. The agreement will extend solely to land acquired for the purposes of the NDP national roads programme. It will apply to land for which compensation has not already been determined and which is not the subject of planning permission or zoned for open space, commercial, residential, industrial or recreational purposes. The agreement is due to take effect from 10 December next and will operate under the framework of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and for giving me the estimated cost of the goodwill payment of 5,000 per acre. What is the estimated cost of the part of the package which relates to the new means of assessing the market value of the land on a stand alone basis as distinct from a whole farm basis? What is the estimated cost of the replacement of farm buildings and of the new fencing arrangements, which are part of the package? Will the package apply to landowners other than farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The package applies to anyone whose land is being taken for road purposes under the national development plan. That will mainly, but not solely, be farmers. Other people own land who may not be full-time farmers. It relates to land which is not the subject of planning permission or zoned for open space, commercial, residential, industrial or recreational purposes. It is impossible to put an estimated cost on the total package. I have seen an estimate by the IFA that the total package is worth approxi<Col N="134" /> mately 200 million. It is impossible to give such a figure because while we have rough estimates about the amount of land that will be taken and some idea of the general number of farmers affected, we do not know specifically how many farmers will be affected until road lines are decided. I am not in a position to either agree or disagree with the figure put into the public domain by the IFA. The 5,000 premium, based on the estimate of 25,000 acres which might be affected, will cost approximately 100 million to 125 million. I cannot be more accurate than that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the assessment the President of the IFA stated on a radio programme this week? I hope I summarise his view correctly. His judgment was that the effect of assessing the market value of the land on a stand-alone basis might have the effect of increasing the value of the land from, for example, £5,000 per acre on a whole-farm basis, to about £20,000 per acre on a stand-alone basis. The goodwill payment is estimated to cost in the order of 125 million and the estimated cost of the market value of the land could therefore be above that at between £200 million and £300 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that assessment. I did not hear the radio programme, but based on what the Deputy says I do not agree that the price per acre would go from £5,000 to £20,000 per acre based on a stand-alone assessment. In some places the value of an acre of land may be more than is being paid currently, but it is the case in very few areas. In other places the value might be less. The average price per acre, including compensation, paid on about 18 of the last CPOs for major roads, was about £13,000 per acre.</P>

      <P>Some 90% of my Department's spending flows to local authorities in capital grants and subsidies. I am sure the Deputy will join me in welcoming the significant additional spending on infrastructure announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in the budget yesterday. It brings my Department's 2002 Estimate to a level over 18% above the revised Estimates provision for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's question may refer to general purpose allocations for local authorities made under the local government fund. I have recently notified local authorities of these allocations for 2002, which total 593 million &ndash; £467 million. I am satisfied these allocations, together with local sources of income, will allow local authorities to improve further the services they provide to local <Col N="135" /> communities. The total 2002 allocation represents an increase of almost 10% over the consolidated baseline for the current year. This is almost double the current rate of inflation. The cumulative increase in general purpose allocation, from the initial 1997 allocations to 2002, will stand at some 74%. As well as standard across-the-board increases in 2002, a sum of 15 million &ndash; £11.8 million &ndash; has also been allocated via the needs and resources model, which is designed to refine the approach to the sharing of the local government fund allocations between local authorities.</P>
    <P>The local government fund also finances non-national road grants, which have increased substantially in recent years, from 221.95 million &ndash; £174.8 million &ndash; in 1997 to 410.836 million &ndash; £323.56 million &ndash; in 2001. That is an increase of some 85%.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>I will notify authorities of their 2002 allocations early in the new year.</P>
    <P>This record level of funding delivers on the Government's commitment to empower local authorities, through a solid base of funding, to respond swiftly to the needs of local communities and to plan for the challenges of the future. I am circulating details of individual local authority allocations in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>Whatever about the sharing of the local government fund, is the Minister aware that the average increase to local authorities does not even come close to covering inflationary costs? In the case of some local authority functions those are a multiple of the increase. Not inconsiderable costs have been imposed on local authorities due to responsibilities the Minister has passed on to them to provide so-called better local government. Additional energy and operational costs arise from the incremental increases that occur each year due to the provision of additional infrastructure, not to mention the <Col N="137" /> quantum leap in the cost of waste management. Given these circumstances, how does the Minister expect local authorities to provide even the same level of service? Is he aware that even now, when local authorities are calculating their Estimates for the coming year, far from increasing services, they are actually voting for savage cutbacks?</P>
      <P>This Minister, in the Government of full and plenty, is known as MacSharry mark 2. He was down in Wicklow today or yesterday expressing concern about illegal dumping, but how does he expect local authorities to carry out inspections of illegal dumps? Illegal dumps, not always of hazardous waste, are widespread and without adequate resources it is impossible for local authorities to police them, even when they are reported. How does the Minister expect to maintain any credibility with the public if, in spite of all that has been said about better local government, there are to be savage cutbacks?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what planet the Deputy is living on. I have indicated, very clearly, the level of increases this year, which is, on average, over twice the rate of inflation. There has been a 74% increase in allocations to local authorities since 1997. I do not regard better local government as an extra imposition on local authorities, I regard it as a means of delivering the services they should be delivering &ndash; and have been delivering &ndash; in a better, more cost-efficient manner. Every local authority should provide quality customer service and they should not view doing so as an added extra.</P>
      <P>The additional responsibilities local authorities will have when extra infrastructure has been put in place have been recognised in the model. A sum of money was provided separate to the needs and resources model in recognition of the fact that, for example, sewerage works mean added costs in the current year that are not met by the model until the following year.</P>
      <P>Waste management has always been a direct function of local authorities and they have been told that the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle means they have to find the funds for enforcement from their own resources. Capital allocations were made for waste management in the past and they will be made again on foot of the new waste management plans in the various regions. I do not accept excuses from any local authority that is not enforcing action against illegal dumpers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that An Bord Pleanála has the necessary resources to fulfil its functions. My Department and the board have been assessing, on an ongoing basis, a range of <Col N="138" /> measures to enable the board to process appeals more expeditiously and to discharge the new functions transferred to it in accordance with the provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. As a result, significant additional staffing and financial resources have been allocated to the board. In July 2000, I approved an increase of 29 additional staff consisting of nine professional planners and 20 administrative staff. An additional four administrative staff were approved in July 2001, bringing the authorised staff complement, excluding board members, to 138. This is an increase of 53 since July 1997.</P>
      <P>When publishing the board's annual report for 2000 on 22 November 2001, the chairman indicated that the exceptional measures taken by the board to deal with the difficulties in recruiting and retaining trained planners were now proving effective and would significantly assist in reducing the time taken to process appeals. The board has engaged the services of 79 individual planners to provide professional planning reports on the smaller types of appeals on a fee-per-case basis in relation to the smaller appeals. In addition, the board has entered into contracts with seven private consultancy firms to provide reports on the larger cases. It has also set up a panel of consultants to hold hearings and make reports on motorway schemes, compulsory purchase orders and other procedures newly devolved to it where public infrastructure is concerned. I have also appointed three new members to the board, which will have the effect of increasing the number of board members to 12 from the beginning of 2002.</P>
      <P>I anticipate that all these measures will enable the board to eliminate the backlog of appeal cases by mid-2002 as well as to discharge effectively its new functions where major infrastructural projects are concerned.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the effect of the additional responsibilities on An Bord Pleanála concerning motorway orders, environmental impact statement assessments and ordinary road orders made by local authorities means such bodies are now caught up in the delays in An Bord Pleanála? This was supposed to be the new streamlined planning system which would deliver the infrastructure. Does the Minister realise decisions have already been postponed not once but twice in some cases and the board has only these responsibilities a few months? Does he believe any of these problems and the backlog can be eliminated and some form of a reasonable planning system put in place <Col N="139" /> against a background where he is reducing the budget for An Bord Pleanála by a massive 13%?

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, a local authority has powers to remove an unauthorised Traveller encampment from a public place where it is located within five miles of an approved halting site, provided alternative accommodation is available on an approved site to which the unauthorised encampment can be moved. Subject to the same proviso regarding available alternative accommodation, there is also a general power for a local authority to remove an unauthorised encampment from a public place where this is unfit for human habitation or is likely to interfere with public or private amenities or constitutes a health hazard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> Where an unauthorised Traveller encampment is located in a public place within one mile of approved Traveller accommodation, it may be removed to a location which is not less than one mile from such approved accommodation, irrespective of whether alternative accommodation is available. These measures were designed to give assurance that areas in which official Traveller accommodation is provided should not become a focus for illegal encampments.</P>
    <P>These legislative measures may not have fully anticipated the type of large scale movement of Travellers referred to in the question and which have raised concerns in recent years. Nonetheless, local authorities should use to the full their existing powers under the 1998 legislation, together with the range of powers they already enjoy under, in particular, litter, waste management and road traffic legislation, to secure abatement of the nuisance presented by large scale illegal encampments. I am pressing local authorities to use the powers available to them, and I am also examining the extent to which the existing legislation might usefully be amended.</P>
    <P>The recent incidents of unauthorised encampments, in some cases by Travellers who have accommodation available to them, appear to raise issues wider than accommodation matters proper to the Housing Acts, such as issues of public order, intimidation and trespass. I have taken up this matter with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with a view to exploring whether this type of incident may require to be dealt with on a broader front. He has referred these issues to the monitoring committee on the implementation of the 1995 report of the task force on the Travelling community, which in turn has set up a sub-group consisting of representatives of my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the social partners and Traveller organisations to examine the issue. Its terms of reference are to produce by a consensus approach a report on the issue of trespass by Traveller encampments and to advise what can be done to minimise the negative impact of large scale movements of Traveller groups. This examination will also extend to the adequacy of the existing range of powers available to deal with such incidents, including enforcement issues, and any changes to such powers which may be considered necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled Questions Nos. 56 and 59 which embrace the same subject as this question. I do not wish to be at odds with the Minister of State but the position is chaotic. I have no doubt the problem is largely due to the fact that almost no local authority is providing sufficient transient sites. Does the Minister of State agree with that? This is the nub of the problem. I would like to see statutory controls introduced making it necessary for local authorities to provide the requisite number of transient sites for Travellers. Is there any hope that might be done?</P>

    <Col N="141" />
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third occasion we have discussed this issue on Question Time. On both the previous occasions, I outlined my concern at the failure of local authorities throughout the country to provide transient sites. I indicated that, until local authorities provide transient sites, there is little likelihood of them succeeding in court applications when a judge has nowhere to which he can order the people concerned to move their caravans. This is a major omission on the part of many local authorities in adopting their programmes for accommodation for Travellers as they are required to do by statute. Thirty out of the 35 or so submissions made by local authorities indicated they would provide transient sites. I am concerned that, so far, only three local authorities have transient sites available. One of them is in my constituency and I am, therefore, familiar with the success of having a transient site.</P>
      <P>The problem which arose this summer where huge numbers came to Dublin and adjoining counties and parked in enormous numbers, sometimes up to 600 people and more than 100 caravans, is something which was not anticipated by anyone during the debate on the Traveller accommodation legislation in 1998. As I have indicated in my reply, I am examining the legal position, as is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to see if new powers to remove unauthorised encampments should be brought forward.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I have had discussions with the greater Dublin local authorities regarding the provisions of transient sites. There was a major gathering of elected members and officials in this regard. We will be in touch with them again and there will be follow-up on the discussions we have had. In the greater Dublin area I am seeking that all the local authorities proceed together to provide transient sites in their areas. There appears to be a fear that, if one local authority goes ahead and the others do not, there will be an attraction for Travellers to go to that county, resulting in considerable illegal parking.</P>
      <P>We are tackling the issue. There is a statutory requirement on each local authority. They have not been as active as I would have wished them to be. I have urged them on several occasions to be more active in this regard, most recently in a circular which issued on 1 November and in the face-to-face meeting with the Dublin local authorities.</P>

Principal among these were proposals to amend the functions of a referendum commission, including removing the role of presenting the arguments for and against a proposal, providing a new power to allocate finance equally among pro and anti sides, and a recommendation to provide additional functions to promote voter participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These and other matters are under consideration in the context of whether to establish a com<Col N="143" /> mission for the forthcoming referendum on the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution, under the existing legislation or under amended legislation. When the Government has made a decision on these matters an announcement will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree he has considered the matter further and that a decision has been made that will go to Cabinet? Is the Government considering amending legislation prior to the referendum because it so dislikes what the referendum commission achieved, although it achieved quite a lot? When will this legislation be brought forward? Will the Minister confirm that he is considering a number of options? Is he considering, first, not initiating the referendum commission before the next referendum? Is he considering perhaps amending the legislation so that the commission will simply tell people the referendum is taking place and encourage them to vote, or is he considering amending the legislation so that the commission will distribute money equitably, which would mean the bigger parties would get most of it?</P>

      <P>Excuse me, let me answer the question. I said that these and other matters are under consideration in the context of whether to establish a commission. The Government did not initiate this, it is responding to a committee report. I do not know whether the Deputy is on the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy reads the report he will find that there was a view across the board, which is supported by independent <Col N="144" /> research, that the method of arguing for and against a proposal is leading to confusion. There is a recommendation in the report that we should consider giving the commission power to allocate finances equally between pro and anti sides because it cannot be done any other way. There is also a recommendation to provide additional functions. We are considering all those things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>With specific reference to Question No. 52, will there be a referendum commission for the forthcoming abortion referendum? The legislation for the abortion referendum has been pushed through the House with a guillotine. The Taoiseach has announced that the referendum is to take place in February, so there is very little time within which to make the announcement to which the Minister referred earlier. I want to know directly from the Minister whether there will be a referendum commission for the abortion referendum. If so, when will that be announced? If not, when does the Government intend to introduce amending legislation to provide some other means of allocating resources for that particular referendum campaign?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, the Government has no power, nor has anybody else, to allocate money to pro or anti sides. If that is what is decided, it would require legislation. The Government has not yet decided whether there will be a referendum commission for the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution. The Government is considering the report by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. According to the legislation, the Government does not need to set up a referendum commission. There is no compulsion on it to do so and, therefore, that is one of the options. The second option we will be considering on foot of the report is whether to set up a referendum commission with the same functions. A third option is whether to set up a referendum commission and change its functions. All those options are still being considered.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the referendum commission established for the Nice treaty referendum did not spend its full funding allocation? Was that due to the fact that the referendum was so rushed and there was not enough time to inform the electorate? Will the Minister take that into account for forthcoming referenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The referendum commission for the Nice Treaty had 49 days between the date it was established and the date the referendum was held, which was similar to the timespan for the referenda on the abolition of the death penalty <Col N="145" /> and recognising the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. It was longer than the referenda on the Good Friday Agreement and local government recognition. As the final costs are not available to me, I do not know whether the commission spent its full allocation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the All-Party Committee on the Constitution recommended previously that there should be a three-month lead in, in other words about 90 days? That is the reason the referendum commission could not do its job effectively. Can we have an analysis of that? The Government is trying to scrap the referendum commission because it does not want people to know the truth about the issues in referenda.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister seriously telling the House that a Government which decides everything on the basis of how it will run politically has not decided, a few working weeks before this referendum that has been promised for February, how the referendum campaign will be run and whether there will be a referendum commission? Is this reluctance to tell us whether there will be a referendum commission related to the Taoiseach's apparent change of heart on whether he will support the referendum he has promoted, given that the wind appears to be changing direction concerning its prospects of success? The legislation for the abortion referendum was rushed through the House and guillotined on <Col N="146" /> every Stage. This is a simple matter. We are going to have a referendum in February. When will there be a decision from the Government as to whether a referendum commission will be established in order that we all know how the issues in the referendum campaign, which were not debated here, will be communicated to and debated by the public?</P>

      <P>I understand that faulty alarms gave rise to 11% of the noise complaints made to Dublin Corporation in 2000, the third lowest of all categories of complaint listed. Nevertheless, I recognise that alarms are a source of neighbourhood noise. A number of arrangements are in place to reduce the incidence of unnecessary noise from alarms and to tackle persistent incidence of such noise.</P>
      <P>The National Standards Authority of Ireland has published a voluntary standard specification, I.S. 199 of 1987, and operates a certification scheme to that standard, which, <i>inter alia,</i> specifies a minimum 15 minutes and maximum 30 minutes duration for the sounding of external alarms in buildings, with the alarm being required to cease automatically after the maximum duration. The connection of monitored business intruder alarm systems to Garda stations is contingent, <i>inter alia,</i> upon the use of alarm systems which are certified by NSAI and installed by certified installers.</P>
      <P>A European standard for external intruder alarms, which will replace all current national standards, is in development and will incorporate considerably stricter controls regarding minimum and maximum duration for the sounding of alarms. The new limits are 90 seconds minimum and 15 minutes maximum and will be the only standard applicable once all elements of the new European standard are finalised.</P>
      <P>I understand that the promulgation of the Irish standard, the development of the European standard, the requirements of the Garda for monitored alarms, improved equipment, and the co-operation of installers certified by the National Standards Authority of Ireland have, together, been instrumental in ensuring that the incidence of false alarms and the failure of audible alarms to cut off have been very significantly reduced. No standards have been set for the operation of car alarms.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Noise) Regulations, 1994, a local authority or any person may seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available from my Department.</P>
      <P>In light of the above, I have no proposals to introduce further legislation in respect of noise arising from house or car alarm systems.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply which was far more comprehensive than the reply by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to my last question. When is it expected that legislation will be introduced here so that there can be proper monitoring of alarms? Will the Minister of State agree this has become a serious issue partic<Col N="148" /> ularly in the city where people are continually disturbed not only be house alarms but also by car alarms? Does he agree that part of the problem is that certain cowboy companies have been installing alarms, and that we have not, to date, properly monitored the problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot indicate when the EU standard will be in place. Most neighbourhood complaints relate to domestic noice such as loud music, late parties, animals, DIY businesses, not house or car alarms. Dublin Corporation logged 381 noise complaints in 2000 of which 41 or 11%, arose from intruder alarms. This is less than half the level of complaints about the domestic sector which represent 23% of total complaints. The standards authority of Ireland specifies a maximum alarm duration of 30 minutes as stated in my reply. The new European standard reduces the limit to a maximum of 15 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply, the Minister of State said the duration for the sounding of alarms would be reduced from a maximum of 30 minutes to 15 minutes. That is not my experience. How is it intended to monitor and regulate the position given that house and car alarms can sound indefinitely?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State accept that the reason there is such a low level of reportage of noise from alarms is that people recognise there is no point in reporting it as there are no regulations governing this area?

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Once the European standard is put in place, we will be governed by it. No standards have been set for car alarms but all manufacturers demand high specification alarms for installation in the models they produce which generally operate satisfactorily and do not go off unless there is some interference or fault. When the European standard is put in place there should be an improvement in the position.</P>

The agreement reached includes provision for a strong compliance system, operational rules for the Protocol's flexible mechanisms, arrangements for limited access to additional links and additional funding to support developing countries in adapting to climate change.</P>
    <P>Parties are now in a position to proceed with ratification of the Protocol and the EU and member states, in their continued leadership of international climate negotiations, are making the preparations necessary to ratify the Protocol as soon as possible. It is our expectation that this will be done in sufficient time to allow for its entry into force by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in September 2002. The Protocol requires sufficient developed country parties, representing at least 55% of 1990 emissions of CO2 from this category of country, to ratify before it may enter into force. The EU will maintain its efforts to ensure the necessary parties ratify the Protocol so that it may come into legal operation.</P>

      <P>The national climate change strategy was published last November. There are a substantial number of measures across a range of Departments that have to be put in place. There have been a number of developments over the past 12 months and they will continue during the next 12 months. For instance, necessary changes to the building regulations to reduce the energy requirements have been accelerated to ensure their full implementation well ahead of 2005, the date contained in the strategy. New renewal energy competition is almost complete to provide an extra 255 megawatts of generating capacity in electricity and full market access to electricity has been granted for CHP. There has been substantial investment in public transport in the national development plan, which will reduce reliance on the private car, especially in Dublin. There has been a 30% increase in premia for private sector forestry and there has been a range <Col N="152" /> of other developments across all sectors. I do not accept we have to wait for budget day every year before we further implement what is contained in climate change strategy.</P>

      <P>How far in excess of the Kyoto targets, to which we agreed, is this country working on a business as usual basis? The EPA reported last year that we were at about twice the limit, to which we agreed.

      <P>Some confusion arises about the limits and so on. The EPA projected on a number of occasions that if we continue on a business as usual scenario, if we do not do anything, that we would reach a level of 37% plus rather than the level of 13% plus in 1990. That is based on economic assumptions and growth rates of 7% or 8%, which is not the case now. The latest figure I saw &ndash; if it is incorrect I will come back to the Deputy on it &ndash; is that we are now at the level of 20% plus on the 1990 figures.</P>

      <P>The move away from the use of high sulphur diesel is part of an attempt to reduce some of the gases contained in, what is called, the greenhouse gas basket and to meet targets, but it is also designed to meet targets under other Protocols and other international obligations.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment and Local Government</askee>
      <Quest>his proposals for dealing with sludge from waste water treatment plants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[31018/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Sewage sludge is an inevitable and potentially useful by-product of advanced waste water treatment processes. The volume of such sludge will inevitably grow as a result of the major investment in waste water treatment facilities now under way as part of the national development plan. It is desirable, therefore, and in accordance with EU requirements, that sewage sludge should be re-used wherever appropriate. Sludge management plans are being developed by all relevant local authorities in the context of waste management planning generally. These plans are intended to address the management of waste water sludge in a progressive and environmentally sustainable way. I anticipate that this planning process will be completed early in 2002.</P>
      <P>My Department has taken steps over the past decade to promote improved management of sewage sludge and has, for example, provided detailed guidelines and financial assistance to support the preparation of sludge management plans by local authorities. At this stage, all marine dumping of sewage sludge is statutorily prohibited and has been terminated. Treated sewage sludge from the main Dublin waste water treatment plant is reused as an agricultural fertiliser.</P>
      <P>Following a series of studies commissioned by my Department in relation to the re-use of sewage sludge, arrangements are being put in place by other local authorities for the full treatment of sewage sludge, including pasteurisation, and its conversion into a soil conditioner and fertiliser, or biosolids.</P>
      <P>To assist the farming sector and local authorities in implementing this approach, a code of good practice for the use of biosolids in agriculture and a guidance document for the preparation of sludge management plans by local authorities, with an associated model plan, have both been published under my Department's auspices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I agree with him that when all these waste water <Col N="154" /> treatment plants are in place, the volumes of sludge will become a problem. Will the Minister confirm if land spreading of sludge is to be allowed under an EU directive, perhaps conditionally? Also, from where will the funding for the treatment of sludge come? Will it be provided by the Minister's Department or encompassed in the waste water treatment costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU directive is not about land spreading of sludge. I referred in the earlier part of my question to biosolids and the sludge being properly treated and pasteurised. That is permitted. The spreading of sludge on land is not permitted.</P>
      <P>The costs of the sludge treatment facilities are part of the water services investment programme and are funded by my Department in addition to the funding allocated for planning which, in many cases, means that local authorities are centrally disposing of the sludge. All of those capital works are being financed by my Department and the remainder of the works are part of the water services investment programme. As I said earlier, because the needs and resources model do not pick up these new facilities for a period of 12 months, that will be taken into account in the allocations to local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 46, 49, 51, 54 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium, I was pleased to extend the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal to five new urban areas in 1998 and to a further five urban areas in 2000. These are additional to the bans which have been operated in Dublin since 1990 and in Cork since 1995. All areas have since shown a considerable improvement in air quality to the benefit of both people and the environment, particularly so for the more vulnerable sections of the community such as the young, the elderly and those suffering from respiratory illnesses.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, it is now right to consider whether the ban should apply nationally. Ireland also faces challenging targets to reduce national sulphur emissions, and I recognise that a national ban on bituminous coal alone would increase the use of petcoke, a fuel with a higher sulphur content. Accordingly, on 17 October last, I issued a consultation paper on a potential national ban on bituminous coal and petcoke.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the consultation process is to hear the views of all interested parties, explore all the issues and avenues and make decisions based on informed debate. All responses received will be fully evaluated by Government before any decision on whether to proceed with a national ban is taken.</P>
      <P>The initial closing date for receipt of responses to the consultation paper was 16 November 2001. However, in response to the strongly stated wish of the solid fuel industry to respond in a detailed and considered way, I have indicated that I am willing to facilitate the Solid Fuel Industry Association and extend the consultation period. The effect on the solid fuel industry is one of the obvious issues raised in my consultation paper and the views of the trade, as well as the wider public, are important in considering this aspect.</P>
      <P>The availability of alternative products is among the issues specifically raised in my consultation paper. There is clearly a need to ensure that sufficient quantities of alternative products would be available in the event of bans on bituminous coal and petcoke. I am satisfied that a trade supplying alternative fuels would continue to support employment, and I look forward to hearing the views of industry in this regard.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the continuing strength of the industry, and the availability of alternative fuels, are key issues in determining the impacts on rural areas. I do not intend to disadvantage rural areas in any extension of the ban.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards any increased costs of alternative solid fuels for people on low incomes, the consul<Col N="156" /> tation paper proposes that payment of the supplementary fuel allowance would be extended by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to all qualifying persons during the winter heating season.</P>
    <P>The Government is pursuing sulphur emissions reductions across a range of sectors. Ireland must reduce overall national emissions of sulphur dioxide by 76% below 1990 levels by 2010 under the Gothenburg protocol. A new directive on national emissions ceilings has also been recently agreed between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. To help us achieve these targets, I have made regulations reducing the sulphur content of both petrol and diesel by between 30% and 70% and, for the first time, placed a mandatory cap on the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil used in industry and power generation.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of consultation is to explore all the issues and allow transparent, open and informed debate. The solid fuel industry has much relevant information to bring to Government in the interests of environmentally and economically sound debate, but must also share significant responsibility for improved environmental performance. I am confident that, working together, we can resolve the key concerns during the consultation process and in this regard I look forward to the industry's considered response to the proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for his detailed response and I welcome the fact that he has extended the consultation period. The solid fuel trade group has put forward reasoned arguments on the difficulties that would arise if a ban were implemented. Will the Minister of State agree that the implementation of a ban on the sale and distribution of bituminous coal would bear heavily on households dependent on solid fuel? Will he agree also that a ban would cause particular problems for people living in remote rural areas and that it would impose a severe financial burden on the elderly in particular and people on low incomes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The first ban was introduced in 1990 and was extended to Cork in 1995. Ten additional areas, five in 1998 and five in 2000, were included in the ban. In all these areas, the clear indication is that the reduction in smoke levels has been dramatic and the benefit to people with respiratory problems, the elderly and the young, has been significant.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects to this issue, environmental and health, and we cannot ignore them. This is a general consultation process. The industry appears to think a decision has already been made in relation to a national ban. I assure the House that is not the case. There are genuine concerns in the industry that need to be addressed, but we can only do that through proper dialogue between the industry and the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the impact on rural areas, I have addressed those concerns in the consultation <Col N="157" /> paper. Everything is up for discussion and the industry has a role to play. No one can accuse us of being wrong in the past by extending those areas. We have received correspondence from individuals throughout the country requesting that bituminous coal be banned in their areas. The Government has a responsibility to respond. Like many other Members, I have received calls from frightened older people who have been told they would have no coal over Christmas into the early months of the new year. I assure industry and the individuals concerned that my officials are not responsible. The consultation process is for real. I want the people involved to talk to us so that we can work out a solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is probably aware we heard representatives of the solid fuel industry at the Committee on the Environment and Local Government yesterday. I welcome the Minister's comment that this is a consultation period. The industry representatives expressed a genuine willingness to work with him. They want a balanced approach and recognise that they bear some degree of responsibility for reducing sulphur levels. They have serious concerns, however, about providing alternative fuels for people who are completely dependent on solid fuel. I hope this worry emerges in the consultation period.</P>
      <P>I have received correspondence from a person who runs a steam railway which is totally dependent on bituminous fuel. Will provision be made for him, given that there are no alternatives in his case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been assured there are alternatives. When I have been long gone people will still be using coal on open fires. The issue is the type of solid fuel used. All aspects of the matter will be addressed. I am certain the alternative to Petcoke and bituminous coke which is found will be suitable for use in the area of concern to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that there will be proper consultation and assure the community that the concerns and anxieties being created are unfounded. The Government will honour its responsibility. We cannot run away from the problem. We have been assured by people in the industry that there are suitable alternatives. It may take time in terms of getting the necessary volumes.</P>
      <P>All these matters will up for discussion. Until now, I have not received a request for a meeting from the industry.</P>

      <P>I am very impressed with the Minister of State's assurances that this will be a very extensive consultation process. I assume it will last at least until the general election. Could the Minister of State inform the House when the consultation process will be completed and a decision taken on the matter? Does he agree that only 5% of sulphur emissions here are generated by burning Petcoke products in domestic fires? Why then has he focused so much attention on <Col N="158" /> reducing the level of emissions from such a small part of the problem rather than tackling the other 95%?</P>

      <P>We are not dealing with only one sector. We have banned leaded petrol from 1 January 2000 and reduced sulphur levels in petrol and diesel. In terms of infrastructure, the Jack Lynch Tunnel has removed all the heavy traffic from Cork city and new bypasses have been constructed to help the environment. All areas must play their part in achieving our targets by 2010. The success of measures we took in other areas has been shown.</P>
      <P>I re-emphasise the health aspects of this. St. James's Hospital carried out a study over a 14 year period before and after the ban in Dublin. It found that following the ban, mortality rates fell by almost 15% among people with respiratory problems and by 3.8% among people with cardiovascular problems. We cannot ignore the issue, particularly when other parts of the country are seeking equality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Hogan, for sharing time. The budget speech by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, highlighted six U-turns he has taken on last year's budget. There has been a complete turn around in policy. He gave numerous commitments not to borrow for the budget, yet he borrowed, begged and stole from every source he could in order to make up the accounts for this year's budget. In last year's budget he reduced VAT by 1%. This year he increased it by 2%. Last year he gave a commitment not to increase the price of low sulphur diesel. He increased it by 5p a litre this year. Last year he introduced several measures to deal with inflation. This year he introduced inflationary measures which will cause huge problems in the first half of next year. The employers PRSI reduction is a turn around on the policy he implemented last year. Interest relief on rented <Col N="160" /> residential property and stamp duty rates for investors is a turn around in policy and is, I am sure, extremely embarrassing for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who made numerous solo runs on the issue.</P>
      <P>I will focus on each of these six U-turns by the Minister yesterday. The first relates to his no borrowing commitment. Everybody on both sides of the House would agree that the 1977 budget was disastrous for the economy and the country as a whole. It took us 15 years to rectify the mess which followed. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has now introduced another 1977-style budget to buy votes for the general election. The sole purpose of yesterday's budget was to buy as many votes as possible in order that the Government can go back into power after the next general election, and to hell with the economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister proudly announced that his budget shows an Exchequer surplus of 170 million. This surplus is a three-card trick. He robbed 635 million from the social insurance kitty and cashed in on the once-off benefits from the Central Bank to get another 610 million, money which belongs to the general public. The Minister is using this money, which people have not put into circulation and which may be lying around the place in certain quarters, for his budget. This money belongs to the ordinary Joe Soap in the street. If it is ever returned to the Central Bank, the bank will cough up but, at the end of the day, the Exchequer will have to repay those moneys again to the Central Bank to redeem outstanding payments.</P>
      <P>The capital services redemption fund has generously given up another 500 million. When we exclude the Minister's accounting tricks, his Exchequer surplus of 170 million becomes a deficit of 1.6 billion this year. When the advanced payment of corporation tax is included, this brings the deficit to 2.4 billion, rising to 3 billion next year.</P>
      <P>Where will the money come from for next year? Typical of his past actions, we see from the introduction of reduced betting tax that the Minister is again gambling with the economy. This time it has serious repercussions for the future growth and development of the economy. The 3% reduction in betting tax will not assist the Minister to save us from the downturn he is now forcing on the economy or from the increase in next year's budget deficit. The Minister is like a Santa Claus who gives every child a gift at Christmas but looks for it back in the new year. While some sectors will benefit this year they will have to pay for it with interest in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the real net value of the increase in VAT of 2%, and the increase in the price of petrol and diesel of 5p and 6.8p per litre, respectively? In euro, this translates into a 26.5 cent increase in a gallon of petrol and a 36.5 cent increase in a gallon of low-sulphur diesel. The money the Minister is giving out, both in social welfare payments and tax reductions, will be <Col N="161" /> clawed back through the 2% increase in VAT and through the increase in excise duties on petrol and cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The VAT rate is actually being increased by 2%, not 1% as the Minister stated here yesterday. This will claw back much of the benefit of the budget. That 2% is made up of the 1% announced yesterday and 1% which, as the Minister claimed in the House yesterday, was not passed on to the consumer last year. Even though VAT was reduced by 1% last year, the fact that it was not passed on to the consumer means that the additional 1% VAT added on this year will actually mean that the VAT rate will now be 22% because that is what the consumer will have to pay. While the Department might be clawing back only 21%, in reality that is what it means to the consumer. This is a major U-turn on the harmonisation of VAT rates throughout the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his speech yesterday that he was cutting betting tax from 5% to 2% to prevent jobs and revenue in this sector moving off-shore. The problem is they have already gone. William Hill already announced the loss of 200 jobs in Athlone and many of the other big players in this sector have moved their jobs and operations off-shore. Therefore, there will be no net benefit to the economy in saving jobs and protecting that sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister ignored e-commerce, a sector which has been badly hit in the past 12 months. This completely contradicts the policy outlined by the Minister for Public Enterprise and the initiative announced yesterday to make Ireland an e-commerce hub. The average VAT rate throughout the European Union is 19.5%. The Minister pointed out in his Budget Statement last year that there were two reasons for reducing the rate of VAT, the first of which was to alleviate pressure on the consumer price index. The second reason was to encourage the development of e-commerce. Ireland has prided itself on the fact that it has been a low tax economy and has attracted foreign investment and promoted the development of indigenous industry on this basis. In spite of this, the rate is still above the EU average. That is why Fine Gael believes that e-commerce should be encouraged, developed and promoted in Ireland which should become the European e-commerce hub. We should aim to reduce VAT below the EU average initially and, ultimately, reduce it over time to 15%.</P>
    <P>That should have been done in the budget to achieve Ireland's aim of becoming the European centre for e-commerce. Instead, the Minister has upped the VAT rate and contradicted his statement in this House 12 months ago that he was reducing the VAT rate to encourage e-commerce. Software and digital services are easily traded over the Internet. Unless Ireland has a low VAT rate, VAT payments will not be made to the Exchequer because it is difficult to trace such transactions. If we had a low VAT rate, we could ensure that such payments were made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> Another issue is the difference in the VAT rate applied to digital products within the EU and outside it. An Irish company must pay VAT at the Irish rate if it exports digital products for sale in the US, yet VAT is not applied to US products sold over the Internet to Irish and EU customers. Straight away, Irish companies which are selling over the Internet are at a competitive disadvantage to their US counterparts and the same applies throughout the EU. Ireland has one of the highest rates of VAT within the European Union and is, therefore, even at a disadvantage within the European Union. If the Minister wanted to save jobs and promote employment, he should have changed the VAT rate rather than the betting tax rate. The only one who will benefit from the reduction in betting tax is the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, when he goes to the Curragh or Fairyhouse. There is no benefit in it for the economy or for employment.</P>
    <P>Last year I asked the Minister to give a commitment that the 1% VAT reduction would be passed on to the consumer and I was given assurances that the Competition Authority would rigorously enforce it. The Minister admitted that the Competition Authority was not competent to ensure the reduction took place because he admitted openly to the House yesterday that the reduction was not passed on to the consumer. This raises serious questions regarding enforcement by the Competition Authority. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, came into the House today and spoke on the budget. She never once addressed the issue of resourcing the Competition Authority. I can guarantee that within six months we will once again have a rapidly increasing inflation rate.</P>
    <P>Unless we are prepared to adequately resource the Competition Authority, we will have serious difficulties early in the new year. The authority can, under its powers, regulate the VAT increase and ensure that it is passed on to the consumer. This did not happen last year. Despite assurances from the Tánaiste, who told the House she was giving additional resources to the authority, the Minister admitted that it failed dismally to address the issue.</P>
    <P>Diesel price increases represent another Government U-turn. In last year's budget debate the Minister said: </P>
    <P>I am anxious to encourage the use of low-sulphur diesel for environmental reasons. While the current excise reduction of six pence will apply to all diesel at present, I propose that this lower rate will apply to low-sulphur diesel only.</P>
    <P>The Minister has increased the price of low-sulphur diesel by 5p. I know the Road Haulage Association is looking forward to meeting Fianna Fáil Party Deputies to grill them because the association realises the Minister for Finance has done a U-turn and left it high and dry by overturning his decision of last year. Transportation <Col N="163" /> costs in Ireland are the highest in the EU partly because of our pathetic infrastructure. The Government has had five years to invest in it, but not one kilometre of additional motorway has been built.</P>
    <P>Insurance premia are to increase dramatically across the board, but in the haulage industry renewals will increase by between 30% and 100%. In 2001 the cost of insuring a vehicle for continental transportation was between £5,000 and £7,000. This is due to increase in 2002 to between £10,000 and £12,000. This is an increase of almost 100% in 12 months and it will have to be passed on to manufacturers and consumers. It puts pressure on the competitiveness of Irish manufacturers in the EU.</P>
    <P>The Minister's budget provided for a 5p increase in diesel, which translates into a £60 increase in the cost of a full tank. The changeover to low-sulphur diesel from 1 March 2002 will mean an increase of a further £22, but hauliers will have no option but to change due to financial implications. Between now and March the price of diesel will increase by £83 per fill. For an average haulier with ten trucks, this means a weekly increase of £683. The additional cost of refining low-sulphur diesel over ordinary diesel is 1.5p per litre. Including VAT, it is 1.8p per litre, or 36.5 cent per gallon, and not 26.5 cent as we were led to believe yesterday. This was hidden in the detail of the budget. While petrol will increase by 26.5 cent, by 1 March, diesel will cost an extra 36.5 cent. The increased cost of fuel and a 30% increase in the cost of car insurance will have a dramatic impact on every household budget, but no alternatives are in place. Many of us will grow old as we wait for the Luas to hit Dublin streets. This is an anti-rural policy because people who live in rural areas have no option but to use their cars.</P>
    <P>The decision to increase the cost of petrol, diesel and cigarettes will put pressure on inflation as will the euro changeover on 1 January 2002. Russia this week announced its intention to restrict the production of oil, which will increase the cost of oil and cause inflation to rise. In February the new tax on plastic bags will be introduced while in March a 1% increase in VAT, a 1.8p increase in the cost of diesel and a £15 per tonne landfill tax will be introduced, which works out at £22.50 per average household. This is in addition to the dramatic increases in the cost of car, household and employer insurance. The best case scenario is an inflation rate of 4.5% next year, which is double the rate of our major competitor, the UK. When one looks at all the implications, it is clear we will be in serious difficulty next year, as we were last year, in relation to inflation. However, the Government has ignored the problem and buried its head in the sand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to commend the budget to the House, the fifth budget <Col N="164" /> introduced by this Government. It is many years since a Government introduced five consecutive budgets. There have been dramatic changes in society over the past five years and there have been huge improvements in the level of social services over that period.</P>
      <P>When we came into office in June 1997, there were 254,000 people on the live register. Despite the current problems faced by the world economy, that figure has been reduced by more than 100,000. Some 100,000 people who would have been on welfare are now in good jobs. The lower rate of child benefit was £30 per month. Next year, as a result of this budget, it will be £92.50, or 117.60, an increase of over 200% with a further increase to come in the next budget. The old age contributory pension was only £78 per week and we promised to increase it to £100. As a result of this budget it will stand at £116 per week, or 147.30. This is an increase of almost 50%, well ahead of inflation and increases in average earnings. Consistent poverty will have fallen by half by the time the Government leaves office. These are some examples of the dramatic improvements the Government has made.</P>
      <P>This year's budget was framed in very different economic conditions compared to more recent budgets. The world economic downturn has led to a significant slowdown in the Irish economy and to job losses. The budgetary position is much tighter than it has been since the Government took office. Some commentators argued that social spending would have to be cut and that only minimal increases should be given in the budget. The Fine Gael Party, despite all its extravagant expenditure plans, attacked the Government for overspending, but the Opposition parties have a poor record in this area. The rainbow Government of the mid-1990s was harsh on the poor and harshest on the social welfare system. Thanks to social partnership, put in place by Fianna Fáil led Governments since 1987, that Government had a considerable amount of money to spend on health and social welfare. Over the period 1991 to 1995, the economy grew at a rate of almost 5% per annum, which is over three times the EU average. In 1995, the growth rate was over 7%. The rainbow Government had, for the first time in several years, the funds to provide real reform and improvements to help the least well off but the wealth was not spread to the poor and the needy. The opportunity to reform the social welfare system, with Deputy de Rossa as Minister and Deputy Quinn as Minister for Finance, was simply not availed of. Unemployment and poverty remained high despite the booming economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the so-called socialists in the Labour Party and Democratic Left &ndash; do we remember the Democratic Left? Going through some old papers recently I came across an interesting newspaper and I quote from a letter which appeared. It is headed &ldquo;Here to Stay&rdquo; and it is signed by the press officer of the Democratic Left in that <Col N="165" /> particular year. It refers to an article by Drapier that apparently appeared earlier. It reads:</P>
    <P>Drapier would no doubt like to see Irish politics revert to the two and a half party system which made such a mess of this country for so long but I can assure him that Democratic Left has no intention of folding up its tent and heading off into the political sunset. We are here to stay as an independent, democratic, socialist party and Drapier had better get used to it.</P>
    <P>Within months the party was gone but here comes one of them now and this press officer is now part of the two and a half, or should I say the one and two halves, party system.</P>

      <P>I am taking very seriously what the Deputy said and I will repeat it to him. His press officer promised a number of years ago the party was here to stay and would not fold up its tent, yet it did. Now the tent is long folded and the party has succumbed to the two and a half party system.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one thing that came back to haunt the person who wrote the letter and the Deputy's comments last night may also come back to haunt him.</P>
      <P>The so-called socialists in the Labour Party and Democratic Left had the best chance ever in the history of our country to redistribute the wealth but what did they do. They gave a miserable £1.50 increase to old age pensioners representing no real increase in the value of the pension.</P>
      <P>I absolutely reject the arguments that social spending should be held back. This Government is committed to supporting those who are the most disadvantaged in our society. That is why, despite the economic and budgetary downturn, we have provided a record amount of investment in social welfare in each of the last two budgets &ndash; £850 million of extra expenditure per year, well over 1 billion and almost four times the level of the largest social welfare budget package brought in by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>In the last 24 hours I have listened to some of the radio comments and what one person said stood out for me. He said, &ldquo;One of the good things about this budget is the significant increases in social payments&rdquo;. That was said by none other than Deputy Noonan. He then went on to say &ldquo;the individual detail in this budget is not the issue&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the difference between us and Fine Gael. As far as we are concerned we look after the individual. Many individuals have <Col N="166" /> been ringing up and complimenting the Minister on the budget and in particular the social welfare changes. This again confirms that our position is looking after individuals rather than looking after the general position. Deputy Noonan welcomed the increases in his radio interview and he suggested that it was his party who encouraged us to bring forward the child benefit increases. His record does not bear this out. In the last budget of the Government of which he was a member only £1 was added to child benefit. That was in 1997. Last year we gave 25 times that amount and another 25 times this year. I know the truth is bitter but the reality is that for all the Deputy's palaver he is clinging on to the commentators. He hopes that at the weekend the commentators will berate the Government. The reality is that when the Opposition was in office it gave a family with three children an extra £7 in child benefit per month. For the last two years we have given £80 per month to that same family.</P>
      <P>The social insurance fund was established 48 years ago, in 1953. For all but the last five of these years contribution income to the fund was insufficient to meet demands on the fund. During the first 43 years of the fund's existence, the shortfall in income has been met from Exchequer funds. In other words, it was met by transfers from funds raised from general taxation, that is, the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, inflows to the social insurance fund have exceeded outflows. This remarkable turn-around of a decades old pattern of Exchequer subvention is a result of this Government's prudent management of the economy, with the result that the social insurance fund now enjoys an accumulated surplus of over £1 billion or 1.4 billion even after paying out this sum. In these circumstances, it is entirely appropriate that a part of this surplus should be returned to the source from which earlier shortfalls were met &ndash; the value in real terms of transfers in the opposite direction since 1953.</P>
      <P>This year's social welfare budget package is equal to last year's record amount &ndash; £850 million. In a year when the public finances are so tight, it would not have been possible to achieve this level of social spending without recourse to borrowing if the transfer from the fund had not taken place. Are Deputies suggesting that instead of doing this we should have given lower increases in pensions? Are Fine Gael and Labour saying we should go back to the days when old age pensions were only increased by £1.50 per week and child benefit was increased by only £1 per month? Or are they suggesting that we should have left the money sitting in the social insurance fund and resorted to borrowing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour has reached new heights of hypocrisy on this issue. Last Sunday, the Prada-Meinhoff party planned a raid of no less than £815 million on the pension reserve fund. Not only that but Labour's financial terrorists threatened to raid the entire £5.5 billion in the fund which has been put aside for old age pensioners. Yesterday &ndash; three days later &ndash; Deputy McDowell opportun<Col N="167" /> istically objected to the transfer of a much lesser amount from the social insurance fund to the Exchequer despite the fact that Deputy McDowell admitted that the social insurance fund also goes to pay future pensions. In that respect he was inconsistent in his submission.</P>
    <P>The facts are that, notwithstanding this transfer, the social insurance fund will remain in a very healthy financial position. Deputy McDowell in his press release of Sunday said:</P>
    <P>In view of the projected deficit figures facing the Minister this year Labour believes it is not sensible for the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to meet his commitment to set aside 1% of GNP to meet pension requirements. We call on this contribution to be set aside to pay for the capital programme.</P>
    <P>Shame on Deputy McDowell and on the Labour Party for raiding money that is set aside for old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>This morning Deputy Quinn referred to some of the newspapers and to a certain extent I would view that as a sign of somebody with a paucity of views on the budget. Again that just confirms what happened last night. It is often said in this House that when the Dáil finishes early on budget night, as it did last night, it is a good budget. Deputy Quinn mentioned, as he called him, the left wing economist, Moore McDowell and he quoted from him. I can quote from another economist, Colm Rapple. By no stretch of the imagination could he be regarded as a right wing economist. I compliment him for his intuitiveness. Last Sunday in <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> he wrote an article wherein he exhorted the Government to do exactly as it did. He said that logically the surplus should be used to improve existing benefits, introduce new ones and perhaps even subsidise improvements in non-contributory social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>He also said this would enable the Minister for Finance to provide better social welfare improvements because now was the time for the PRSI surplus to pay back on its earlier subsidies. I compliment Mr. Rapple, with whom I do not often agree, on his comments about the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>Even after the changes in this year's budget are taken into account, the projected accumulated surplus in the fund at the end of 2002 will be more than £1.2 billion. The House will agree that the Government's prudent and successful management of the economy over the past four years has provided the foundation upon which the healthy state of the social insurance fund rests.</P>

We promised that all social welfare pensions for older people will be raised to £100 per week by 2002 which we have also delivered on in this budget.

      <P>The qualified adult allowance for a person over 66 was increased from 72% of the old age pension to 77% and now represents 85% of the old age non-contributory pension. As I promised in last year's budget, this will be increased in coming years to the full non-contributory pension rate to benefit women in the home who do not qualify for a contributory pension. These increases are in addition to a series of other measures introduced in recent years designed to enable more people to qualify for pensions, which include the introduction of a special half-rate pension for self-employed and pre-1953 contributors who narrowly failed to qualify for a pension. Non-contributory pensioners have also benefited from the new arrangements to assess capital under the means test for non-contributory pensioners.</P>
      <P>In last year's budget I gave a commitment to increase the widow's and widower's pension for those over 66 to the full rate of contributory pension and we have moved further on that with a special increase of £12 for them. The needs of younger widows and widowers have not been forgotten either. People with children can experience particular financial difficulties at the time of the loss of their spouse. In recognition of this, in December 1999 we introduced a special widowed parents grant to help bereaved parents with financial costs at this very difficult time. In this year's budget we are increasing this grant to 2,000 &ndash; almost doubling the payment from its current level of £1,000. This increase came into effect from budget day.</P>
      <P>Over the period from 1997, general social welfare increases have increased well ahead of inflation and indeed ahead of increases in gross average industrial earnings. In this budget, despite the difficult times caused by the world economic downturn and the resulting pressure on resources, we are giving very significant increases to those who are least well off. Indeed the increases being provided this year are greater than last year's record amounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are providing a general increase of £8 per week in respect of social welfare customers under pension/retirement age. In percentage terms, the £8 increase is between 7.4% to 9.4%, depending <Col N="172" /> on the payment concerned; this is between 3.1% and 5% ahead of inflation. This is unlike when Fine Gael and Labour were in office. They gave no real increase in those payments. In addition we are providing a special increase of £9.50 for those on the lowest rates of social welfare &ndash; supplementary welfare allowance and short-term unemployment assistance. This brings the lowest social welfare rate up to £93.60 &ndash; 118.80 .</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This increase of £9.50 is in line with the majority recommendation of the Social Welfare Benchmarking and Indexation Group, which was established under the PPF and reported last September.</P>
      <P>There is considerable merit in raising all payments, as and when this is possible, with the objective of ensuring a reasonable relationship, in due course, between the average living standards in the community and the level of social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Not only have we made substantial progress towards the PPF target of £100 for lowest social welfare payments, we have almost reached this target this year and I have no doubt but that the target will be exceeded in the remaining budget in the period of the programme. This budget is fully in keeping with our commitments under the PPF.</P>
      <P>It has been a source of some complaint in the past that social welfare increases used to come into effect later than budget changes. We were all berated that increases were announced in December and not delivered until much later. Last year, I brought forward the implementation date of social welfare weekly rate increases to the start of the tax year, that is, 6 April. Now that the tax year has moved to the start of January the budget increases in weekly rates of payment are also being brought forward to 1 January at a cost of £80 million. This means that in 2002, social welfare clients will be paid their increase for the full 52 weeks of the year compared to 29 weeks when we came into office in 1997.</P>
      <P>When we came to office in 1997, the level of child benefit was £30 for each of the first two children and £39 for each of the subsequent children. Last year, we announced the most substantial increases in child benefit in the history of the payment. This year I am delighted to announce that we are again giving record increases of £25 per month for the first two children and £30 for subsequent children &ndash; bringing the rate of payment to £92.60 for the first two children and £116 for subsequent children &ndash; 117.60 and 142.30, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates of payments have been increased threefold over our period of office and we have already achieved in full the child benefit commitment set out in the PPF. To illustrate the scale of <Col N="173" /> these increases I refer Deputies to 1997 when the former Government gave a family with three children an extra £7 in child benefit per month. Last June, we gave similar families an increase of £80 per month and in this budget we have again given them another £80. The effective date of payment for the child benefit will go from September in 1997 to effective from April in 2002, the earliest date from which it was administratively possible to introduce these increases. I am also making a change in the arrangements for entitlement to child dependant allowances to people getting short-term weekly social welfare payments. Currently these allowances are lost as soon as the young person reaches their eighteenth birthday. but from next April this will be extended to the end of the academic year in which the young person reaches the age of 18 years. This is a first step towards increasing the age limit to 22, as promised in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>This Government has promised time and again to continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos in this country and to develop supports which provide practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the duality of life for others. Over the last four budgets we have fulfilled this promise. As a result of changes introduced in these budgets, the number of carers receiving carer's allowance and carer's benefit is up by a massive 107% and, to date, expenditure is up by 184% since this Government took office.</P>
    <P>The means test for the carer's allowance has been eased significantly in recent budgets with improvements in the income disregards. I am again moving further and increasing the disregards so that a single person can have a disregard of 191, £150, and a couple can have a joint income disregard of 382, £300. This measure will be of benefit to 5,700 carers.</P>
    <P>In addition. I am increasing further the respite care grant for carers, which we introduced in June 1999 by 127, £100 to 635, £500, and to 1,270 £1,000, for carers who are caring for more than one person. This payment will be made in June 2002 to recipients of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and carers who are providing full-time care and attention to those in receipt of a constant attendance allowance or prescribed relatives allowance.</P>
    <P>This Government has introduced a number of dramatic improvements in the free schemes during its time in office. The schemes have been made available to all people resident in the State aged 70 years and over, regardless of income or household circumstances. This important change reinforces this Government's commitment to supporting older people in their wish to remain in the community.</P>
    <P>This year I am delighted to announce that I am implementing a further three recommendations from the review of the free schemes. The principal one is the introduction of a household benefits package.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not abuse it. Contrary to recent media reports, which led to concern on the part of some groups representing older people, this measure does not involve the abolition of the free schemes in favour of a single cash payment and I would not favour such an approach. There was a totally erroneous media report which said that we were going to give a cash allowance to people instead of the free schemes. That is not correct. We are streamlining the entire free schemes into the household benefit package. The streamlining of the electricity allowance, telephone allowance and free TV licence scheme into one combined household benefits package will ensure that all recipients will receive the full range of schemes available under these three schemes. In other words, the qualifying conditions for the free schemes will be standardised to ensure that where a person qualifies for one of the free schemes, they will qualify for all the free schemes. This measure will strengthen the community care objectives of the free schemes and will introduce simplicity and clarity.</P>
      <P>I am also increasing the value of the  electricity-gas allowance. This allowance was last increased in 1972 to the current 1.500 units each year. From February 2002 I am increasing the allowance to cover up to 1,800 units of electricity per annum, in addition to normal standing charges and VAT. This improvement recognises that households now use more electrical appliances and that overall electricity consumption has increased over time. I am conscious of the role that the fuel allowance plays in assisting to alleviate poverty.</P>
      <P>In last year's budget I extended the duration of the fuel season by three weeks and this year, in addition to improvements in primary payment rates, I propose to increase the basic fuel allowance from £5, 6.35, per week to £7.09, 9, with effect from the 1 January 2002. This is the first time since 1985 that the basic fuel allowance has been increased. It is estimated that 294,00 people, mainly pensioners, long-term unemployed and lone parents will benefit from this increase at a cost of £17.46 million, 22.17 million, per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of measures in the budget which helped to increase the issue of employability by ensuring that people who have skills will be able to take up new jobs. On the issue of poverty and social exclusion, the numbers of people experiencing consistent poverty has fallen <Col N="175" /> from 15% in 1994 to 8% in 1998. I expect that the figures due out soon will show a significant decline in that figure. In the overall reaction to the budget, it is not often that we get compliments from organisations. Some of the references in the press statement from the Combat Poverty Agency give the budget a broad welcome. They commend the policy direction for increasing social welfare payments in line with wages. It is particularly pleased with the proportion of spending dedicated to social welfare measures in this budget and it says significant progress has been achieved towards helping the less well off. It says the budget will make significant progress in reducing poverty. Over the years the differential between the tax package and social welfare package has been skewed in favour of tax. For the first time in many years, the social welfare package is well ahead of the tax package.</P>
    <P>I have other points to make on this and perhaps I will have an opportunity to do so next week when we are dealing with the legislation in relation to some of the changes. There will be a second Bill, mainly to address the child benefit changes, in the new year. I commend the budget. For the fifth time in a row, I am delighted to be able to say that I have been successful in securing the largest social welfare package ever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It must have been very difficult for a man like the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who prides himself on telling it as it is, to struggle to the end of his Budget Statement yesterday. Whatever else he delivered yesterday, he certainly delivered a terminal blow to his reputation as a straight talker.</P>
      <P>Whoever holds the Finance portfolio in the next Government, it will not be Deputy McCreevy. What a suicide pass he has dispatched to his successor by attempting to disguise the alarming deterioration in the public finances by claiming a phoney surplus of 170 million. It is reminiscent of the fiddling engaged in by his nemesis, Mr. Haughey. However, thanks to EU requirements, he must give the projections for the two succeeding years. They betray the scale of the manipulation in which he has engaged and the size of the poisoned chalice being handed to his successor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget projects a deficit in 2003 of 2.98 billion and in the succeeding year, 2004, of 3.682 billion. They are enormous deficits predicted by the Minister. That is the line in the budget that will most worry people who are concerned about the health of the economy, not to mention the people who will inherit this from the Minister. He is forecasting an enormous 3 billion deficit in the year after next. Nobody in the House, including the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, believes that the 170 million predicted for next year will happen. If he was as far out as a lighthouse this year, how could anyone reasonably believe he might be within scoring distance next year? Given that he <Col N="176" /> has forecast a 3 billion starting deficit for 2003, it indicates the scale of the problem we face.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is more resentful of criticism than he acknowledges. Determined to finish five budgets on a no borrowing note, he instructed his officials that the budget be prepared on that assumption. Money had to be looted from wherever it could be found and special legislation will need to be introduced retrospectively to permit it. The piggy bank had to be raided in Dame Street and the poor box had to be raided in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Quinn, brought in the first budget surplus in modern times in 1997. Given the boom then under way, which continued up to the beginning of 2001, no Minister for Finance who succeeded Deputy Quinn, no matter how profligate, could do other than continue to bring in successive budgets in surplus. It is not a matter to boast about or something for which one deserves plaudits. The buoyancy in taxes over these years and the revenues during the unprecedented boom meant that Robin Hood could not have contrived to bring in budgets in deficits. Yet, the Minister sought yesterday to make a virtue of it.</P>
    <P>It was imperative for his self-image to pretend that his last budget continued the no borrowing supposed achievement. In his Budget Statement he said, &ldquo;We promised five budgets and we have delivered five budgets and without borrowing. My five budgets to date are the five chapters in my first book.&rdquo; As Deputy Quinn said this morning, he is well equipped to write a book on fiction anyway, although I am not sure I would agree with Deputy Quinn that it would win the Booker prize.</P>
    <P>Having instructed his officials to prepare a budget above the line that is notionally in surplus, it became necessary to fiddle the figures, manipulate the accounting, cook the books and raid any fund lying around. The business group editor of <i>Independent Newspapers</i>, Brendan Keenan, concluded this morning that the cumulative raids on the social insurance fund, the Central Bank reserve fund, the Central Bank's windfall from the euro changeover and the taxing on a current year basis of employers for corporation profits tax purposes amount to &ldquo;a grand total of 3 billion&rdquo;. That is the real scale of the manipulation in which the Minister engaged to produce the effect that fits in with his self-image of the man who never borrowed when he was in Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>Moore McDowell, an erstwhile supporter of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, at least on economic matters, this morning called it &ldquo;borrowing in all but name&rdquo;. He continued, &ldquo;In reality we have a budget deficit of well over £1 billion&rdquo; and he concluded, &ldquo;In political terms, his conduct of the budget has completely undermined his reputation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Not only has the Minister manipulated the figures, but also major areas of policy. He has been <Col N="177" /> caught looking both ways. The most dramatic reversal is the provision in housing where people are suffering so much in hugely overpriced rented accommodation and are despairing in lengthening queues for public housing. The Minister has reversed his position in this regard and also the Bacon proposals on mortgage interest relief in what I believe is a vain hope of addressing the crisis that already exists in the private rented sector. It is a straightforward reversal of what he did only a couple of years ago. He produced a crisis and he thinks he can turn it around by simply reversing engines. However, this will not seep through for a long time and hardship will continue to be endured by people in private rented accommodation, where people are being evicted or put into very inadequate hostel or bed and breakfast accommodation because they cannot pay the rent.</P>
    <P>Did you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, think you would see the day when a poor quality three bedroom house in my constituency would cost £800 a month? A woman, who returned from Coventry two years ago, came to see me a couple of weeks ago. She is renting such a house, but a couple of weeks ago the landlord increased the rent by £100. That is the difference between her being on the side of the street and being able to stay in the house. That is repeated all over the city and I suppose it is not much different in other cities. That is the effect produced by the combination of Dr. Bacon, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. The Minister thinks that by reversing it now, it will have an impact before the general election. It will not. Many of these people have put their money into property outside the State, as the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, knows. It will not be reversed in that time. As a sole attack on the housing problem, it will produce the same effect again in terms of the first time buyer.</P>
    <P>This is the second major 180 degree turn by the Minister for Finance in the housing area of public policy. Having threatened developers hoarding land with punitive capital gains tax two or three years ago, the Minister undid himself last year at the point when housing output was beginning to decline and when an incentive was necessary to keep supply up and to end the drip feed of building land into the marketplace. The Minister reversed himself last year and the hoarding of land has resumed. Major developers, who have an umbilical close relationship with the major party in Government, did not believe he would introduce the punitive capital gains tax. He could have left it on the books as it would have had some effect. However, he removed it last year.</P>
    <P>It is not just that the Minister is bringing in the type of budget for which he long condemned his once leader, Charles Haughey, but he is engaged in several contradictory policy stances. I have given housing as an example of one such contradictory policy stance. Another example is the reduction last year of the standard rate of VAT <Col N="178" /> from 21% to 20%. This year he did the exact opposite on the extraordinary make-believe rationale that the &ldquo;reduction was not being passed on&rdquo;. What evidence does the Minister have for that statement? It seems an extraordinary statement for a Minister for Finance to make that a VAT rate of 20% was not passed on to customers, that traders, retailers and others were improperly and illegally profiting from it, that he knew about it but did not do anything and that this justifies reversing his decision of last year from 20% to 21%. Nobody believes that. We have a more educated consumer population now than we had in the past. It is a preposterous argument by the Minister that people believe they were being charged 21% VAT. It did not happen.</P>
    <P>As regards income tax, the Minister spent four years cutting rates and boasting that he had a mandate to do so. He is largely right. However, he has now reversed engines and targeted the moneys he raided from the social insurance fund on personal and PAYE allowances and on broadening the tax bands. He spent four years deriding this side of the House for advocating such targeting on the lower to middle income earners but, confronted with the inevitability of meeting the people at a general election, he does another 180 degrees turn and targets minimal resources on the lower to middle income bracket. The Minister and the Tánaiste have made a living from and dined out on how they cut tax rates and the fools on this side of the House, who tried to advance a principled argument that cutting tax rates was not necessarily the way to reform the tax code or to benefit low to middle income earners, were derided both here and in the south of France. They now come in here and have the cheek to tell us that is what they were in favour of all the time. When the Minister meets people outside the K Club, he will find out that has not gone down as well as he thinks.</P>
    <P>The Minister argues it would be unconscionable not to continue to invest in the new national pension reserve fund. However, at the same time, he mounts a smash and grab raid on the pension fund which is in place. Apart from the legality and propriety of what he proposes, it is accepted by the Government that there will be increased demand on the social insurance fund in the years ahead. He has already provided for a rise in unemployment. Most economic commentators agree with him. There may be a difference in terms of the extent of the rise in unemployment but it appears, and we know from redundancies already notified, that there will be a significant rise in unemployment. Neither the Minister or I know when the downturn will bottom out and things will lift off again. There will be a greater demand on the social insurance fund. Yet he chooses this time to raid a fund which is provided for in law and the purpose of which is stated in law. These are the social contributions of workers and employers which were not intended for the purpose of digging the Minister out of a hole he has created for himself. It is a shame that the <Col N="179" /> Minister is using the raid on the social insurance fund to provide a pre-election sweetener for his backbenchers. It is highly suspect and at least improper and immoral to use workers' and employers' social contributions in this fashion.</P>
    <P>The fifth contradiction by the Minister is that last year he came into the House and promised to leave low sulphur diesel at the low rate. However, this time he comes in and, without batting an eyelid, adds 5p to it. Hauliers, who are already up in arms, do not understand that another 1.5p will be added to it in March. Yet, the Minister does not have any difficulty reconciling the two positions, just as he does not have any difficulty reconciling the extraordinary decision about cider. Of all the areas where he might have levied some additional revenue given the hole he is in, why did he choose cider? I heard the director of the company talking on the radio today about the fact that the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach visited the plant in Clonmel. He said he believed that both of them had an understanding of the labour-intensive nature of the plant at Clonmel, the indigenous nature of the industry. Yet they put a huge 21p increase on the pint of cider. I am at a complete loss to understand that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has permitted publicans &ndash; the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, has facilitated him because he is the acceptable face of public relations &ndash; to increase the price of the pint by whatever they like at any time they choose. Ministers for Finance have not put excise duty on the price of drink since 1993, yet 21p was put on an indigenous drink from Clonmel. Although Deputy Quinn might have had his tongue in his cheek to some extent when he said this was vindictiveness against the people of South Tipperary for the manner in which they rejected Fianna Fáil on two occasions, it is beginning to look a bit like that.</P>
    <P>Most amazingly of all given the duration of his contribution, there was not a word in the Minister's Budget Statement to explain how he got himself into this hole. This time last year, he forecast a budget surplus of 3.2 billion. Additional income from the sale of State assets was a positive embarrassment since, as the Tánaiste memorably put it at the time, &ldquo;The country is awash with money&rdquo;. How many here remember the phrase? In selling off the ICC, the TSB and the ACC, what did we need the money for? The Tánaiste's political soul mate, the Minister for Finance, told us to have a party. Headlines referring to Champagne Charlie who said we should all party were commonplace. Where did all the money go? It was this atmosphere of champagne and partying that led to the daft proposal for a vanity project at Abbotstown where £1 billion was to be spent on the construction of a stadium which would hold the population of western Europe. It was this upbeat mood that allowed us to proceed with the construction of a monument to the country's best known sports fan. The Department of Fin<Col N="180" /> ance must be horrified. Is it going to permit irrevocable contracts to be signed before a new Administration comes into office? That is the question that must be answered.</P>
    <P>It was like the final days of the court of Louis XIV. Champagne Charlie partied on and the good times were going to last forever. People were doing so well that there was never going to be a downturn. As the Taoiseach said, &ldquo;The stadium will not cost £1 billion but, if it does, we will build it anyway&rdquo;. In a classic pass out to the wing, which would do justice to the best rugby centre, the poor Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, has been left to carry the ball as the whole thing comes crashing down. Now the Taoiseach will not answer questions on the issue in the House, diverting them instead to Deputy McDaid. The Minister has done his best to be loyal and I can understand why, but it is a daft vanity project and he knows that. What a mess has been created.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest household budget survey reveals that in the third quarter of 2001, 1,786,600 persons were at work, a figure that has been increasing annually by 48,700. That is a splendid performance by any yardstick. It shows that those who have been losing their jobs have been finding alternative employment. The numbers in employment have not only been maintained, they have expanded. In that case, where has all the revenue gone? Where is the 3.2 billion? There was not one word or a single line in the Budget Statement to explain how it evaporated. I do not know how the Minister permitted such a huge surplus to be frittered away. We have not received any explanation from the Taoiseach or any other Minister. Imagine the howls of derision in his heyday from Deputy McCreevy, as he was in Opposition, if a Minister from these benches had presided over a 50% increase in public spending in three years together with the disappearance of a 3.2 billion surplus. Imagine how the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance would have reacted in Oppo<Col N="181" /> sition if confronted with that set of figures. They would have had a ball.</P>
    <P>This budget is not about consistency, good management, prudence or equity, it is about presentation in the face of the coming electoral contest. Fianna Fáil knows about power and, as history shows, no Charlie in the party could ever refrain from fiddling the books to buy the people's votes if that was what it took to stay in power. The party does not worry about the debris to be picked up after the election because engines can be reversed. The only important thing is to retain power. Remember the man who campaigned in 1987 on the premise that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped. He directed you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to make the most savage cuts between 1987 and 1989, from which the health service has never recovered. Fianna Fáil is now in campaign mode, indeed, some would say the Taoiseach has not stopped canvassing since 28 June 1997. When it comes to campaign mode, distortion of reality is grist to the mill.</P>
    <P>In his contribution today the Taoiseach claimed authorship in Opposition of the concept of a national minimum wage and further claimed to have persuaded me to promote that during the rainbow Government's term in office. Nothing could be further from the truth and, unfortunately for the Taoiseach, I have dug out what he actually said at the time. On 28 October 1995, the then <i>Cork Examiner</i>, under the headline &ldquo;A National Minimum Wage is not the Answer says Ahern&rdquo;, quoted the then Leader of the Opposition as follows:</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil leader, Bertie Ahern, last night delivered a strong attack on the call by the Minister for Social Welfare, Proinsias De Rossa, for a minimum wage. Young people, he declared, should not be deprived of a chance of having a job by misguided legislation designed to save the Department of Social Welfare money.</P>
    <P>That is actually what the Taoiseach said, yet he came into this House today and said he persuaded me of the merits of a minimum wage. As with so many things affecting this Taoiseach, it was precisely the other way around.</P>
    <P>The income tax changes are modest and I understand why in the present climate. The 634 million provided for in a full year is almost balanced out by the 592 million the Minister is taking from roughly the same people through petrol, cigarettes, cider and VAT changes. Combined with the effect of the next phase of the pay round, the effect of the tax changes is fairly neutral. There are certainly no windfalls to taxpayers, no matter how the figures are presented. The legacy the Minister for Finance will bequeath to his successor ought to be compared to that left by Deputy Quinn. Despite facing a general election, Deputy Quinn introduced a sound budget showing a surplus for the first time in modern history. Forecasts for succeeding years were for healthy <Col N="182" /> surpluses, which, in the event, were realised beyond what anyone could have imagined at the time. An additional 80,000 people were at work that year and the economy was in full flow.</P>
    <P>For the incoming Minister, Deputy McCreevy, it must have seemed like a dream. No Minister for Finance had ever been handed such a strong economy and such propitious finances to enable him to make a permanent impact, enhance fairness and equality and address needs in society. The Minister proceeded for four years to distribute wealth upwards and now bequeaths a most difficult scenario to any new Administration. The four years were not intended to end in grief, but perhaps it was inevitable they would. Prior to the intervention of foot and mouth disease, the Taoiseach had perhaps hoped he would be safely back in Government before the chickens came home to roost. At the expense of his reputation as a straight talker, the Minister for Finance has attempted, by raiding the poor box, to conceal the true state of the economy. He has failed and someone else will be left to pick up the pieces.</P>
    <P>It was in terms of the campaign mode into Fianna Fáil has switched that the Tánaiste groggily told Morning Ireland the Labour Party wanted to raise taxes. Nobody in the Labour Party has ever said that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Labour Party and Deputy McDowell have said is if the quality of public services is at issue, we would not refrain, where necessary and in a targeted way, from levying additional tax. That is as a result of the widening gap and the growing inequality identified by many authoritative groups during the lifetime of the Government and during the time when the most propitious resources of any Government were available. It is important that someone says that, if taxes must be levied on those who can afford to pay them, to pay for access to health care on something other than a two-tier basis, a roof over one's head or a medical card if one's child is sick, we will not refrain from doing so. However, it is an entirely different matter to try to attribute to Deputy McDowell or anyone in the Labour Party that we said we would raise taxes. That is the type of game we have seen the Tories play against the Labour Party.</P>

He is reading the minds of the people wrongly. That is not the thinking of the people because I sincerely believe they want a national stadium. I have said before, and Deputy Rabbitte has also alluded to it, that we will not build the national stadium at the expense of the health services, infrastructure or water or sewerage schemes. We will not build it at the expense of local, national and regional projects.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Aylward and Foley. The budget for 2002 is the fifth and final budget of the Government and brings to fruition an ambitious programme of social reform and financial planning. Ireland is often cited as a model for other countries to aspire to and emulate, and this has not come about by accident. We are in a period of economic uncertainty and need a safe pair of hands at the helm. Projections and forecasts have been made by many commentators and, while all factors must be taken into consideration, we do not have the luxury of taking anything for granted. Therefore, a priority of the Government has been providing for the future while making sure the most vulnerable members of our society are also looked after.</P>
      <P>These objectives are more than met in the budget. Members should look at what has been done in health, social welfare, child benefit, pensions and income tax. If budgets are part of a Government's legacy, then we can be proud of what has been achieved in the past five budgets and of what this says about us as a Government.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, I again emphasise what my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, said yesterday when he recognised the important contribution tourism makes to our economy. One in 12 people work in this sector, and before the tragic events of this year, we had a record year for tourism in 2000. We broke the million mark for American visitors to Ireland, and since the Government came into office, there has been a 25% increase in visitor numbers. We were well on course for another record-breaking year when events in 2001 changed things utterly.</P>
      <P>As the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, pointed out yesterday and on other occasions, £3 billion was earned in foreign revenue from tourists in Ireland in 2000. While the agricultural, industrial and information technology sectors are very important to any island economy, large subsidies and grants are given to agriculture and millions of pounds are used to persuade multinational companies to locate here and enter the information technology area especially, visitors to this country spend money in various communities, a certain amount of which eventually ends up in the Exchequer. Some £3 billion in foreign revenue was earned in 2000 through the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in the year we had to put in place emergency measures to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. These measures, together with the adverse publicity abroad, impacted severely on the tourism industry. The Government took swift action by giving me additional funds to run a 12.7 million reassurance campaign in all our major markets, and it worked. Initial forecasts of a 14% decrease in visitor numbers were revised <Col N="185" /> downwards to 4% and all the evidence pointed to a bumper fourth quarter for the industry.</P>
    <P>Then came the tragic events of 11 September. The tourism industry throughout the world has borne the brunt of the terrorist attacks. However, as I have said many times before, we have a very vibrant industry and the fight-back has begun. The provision of an additional 11 million for tourism marketing in yesterday's budget shows the Government's commitment to playing its part in the recovery. When taken together with the provisions in the departmental Estimates, the total Exchequer tourism budget for 2002 will be close to 110 million. The additional funding will be used to enhance promotion of the regions, increase the successful sports tourism initiative and provide additional finance for all-island marketing. I welcome the fact that key tourism industry groups have already endorsed these additional measures.</P>
    <P>I am extremely pleased with the additional funding for regional tourism provided in the budget. It matches our policy of ensuring that the benefits of tourism are spread throughout the country. Although all regions have benefited from tourism growth in the past 10 years, it is evident that some areas have not done as well as others. In this regard, I am also delighted that, after intensive negotiations, we have received EU clearance for the 127 million tourism product scheme. Under the scheme, funding will be available for tourism projects which enhance the potential of less developed tourism areas by supporting the development of significant attractions or clusters of attractions in such areas.</P>
    <P>Tourism Ireland Limited, the new all-island tourism marketing company established under the Good Friday Agreement, and Bord Fáilte, which retains responsibility for product, niche and regional marketing, have recently announced details of their programmes for next year. These plans incorporate the use of the new all-island tourism brand promotional material launched in Dublin and Belfast on 7 November. The Government has also recently approved the amalgamation of CERT and Bord Fáilte to create a single strong development agency for the tourism industry. This change in the institutional arrangements will underpin the future development of the industry.</P>
    <P>Next year, two high profile sporting events will take place here as a result of the sports tourism initiative which I introduced two years ago. The Seve Ballesteros Trophy which is played between Britain and Ireland and the rest of Europe, and the Amex world golf championship which carries a prize purse of $5 million, both come at a very opportune time for the industry. This highly successful initiative has put Ireland on the map for major sporting events. Under the provisions of the budget its funding has been increased to 7.62 million and extended to 2007 to enable longer-term commitments to be made by Bord Fáilte. Looking to the future we can also anticipate hosting the Ryder Cup in 2006.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> We have had nine remarkable years of uninterrupted growth in tourism. We have a strong and vibrant industry with an excellent product base and I am confident that we will overcome recent setbacks. Yesterday's budget announcement will give a welcome further boost to that confidence. Being the first Cabinet Minister with responsibility for sport, I am extremely proud of our record in promoting and developing the profile of sport in this country, from local level participation in sport right up to our training services and support for elite athletes, and support for the national governing bodies of sport.</P>
    <P>During the year the Irish Sports Council formulated a new high performance strategy which will be launched next week. The ISC took on board the concerns expressed by the sporting bodies. We now have a high performance strategy which will compare more than favourably with the strategies of countries worldwide who have continued success in international sport.</P>
    <P>Since the Government took office, it has allocated grants totalling 133 million to over 2,000 different projects. The Government has invested in sport which is continuing to reap the rewards. Funding of 3 million is being provided in the budget to the Irish Sports Council for the implementation of the high performance strategy.</P>
    <P>After the Sydney Olympic Games I asked the Irish Sports Council to undertake a review of the performance of the Irish teams. This was done and a central theme coming through from the national governing bodies of sport, with whom I met to hear their views, was the need for additional investment in coaching and training services as well as support for elite athletes and the national governing bodies of sport.</P>
    <P>Over 2,000 clubs and community groups in nearly every town, parish and village in the country have benefited under the sports capital programme. In the recently published Estimates for 2002, the provision for this programme, which runs in parallel with other major programmes, has increased by 31%. The record of the previous Government on sporting facilities is, sadly, not one to boast about. The vast majority of its members, particularly on the Fine Gael benches, had no interest in sport. They managed to allocate a mere 21.5 million under the programme over their three years in office. I am delighted to see, however, that Deputy Noonan has experienced a Pauline conversion to sport at this late stage. I hope he will be able to continue if he ever gets the chance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2003, the biggest sporting event in the world will be held in this country. In preparation for the <Col N="187" /> Special Olympics summer games work is progressing apace on the development of the National Aquatic and Leisure Centre in Abbotstown. The 50 metre swimming pool is almost completed and we will be ready to welcome the athletes and make the games one to remember for all involved.

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the budget's provisions. I have been a Member of the House for almost 25 years during which time we have had many strange kinds of budgets and mini-budgets. This is a first, however, because never before has the same Minister for Finance introduced five consecutive budgets. That is a record and a remarkable achievement. The Minister will definitely go down in the record books as having presented the best set of budgets in the history of the State.</P>
      <P>I have listened to many contributions to this debate and I am amazed at how short some people's memories are. I recall budgets of the 1980s when on a number of occasions more than one budget was presented in the course of a year. Governments fell because of various issues that arose from the budgetary provisions. I remember when we were taking taxes from people all the time; we had tax rates of 65% plus on the high rate, and in excess of 30% on the lower rate. At one time, things were so bad we were waiting for the International Monetary Fund to step in to look after our affairs.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand it, therefore, when I hear people talking about bad times in relation to our present position. These are certainly not bad times and yesterday's budget proves that. I heard people say that the Minister for Finance should have recommenced borrowing, and they also criticised the manner in which he acquired funds. I would not like to return to borrowing and I compliment the Minister on his decision not to do so. He knows from experience the disastrous consequences that arose from borrowing in the past and, therefore, he has shied away from that course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can recall the massive emigration in the 1980s and the level of social welfare increases that did not remotely approach the rate of inflation. Miserly figures were offered for children's allow<Col N="188" /> ances at the time. We can now see the economic turnaround that has occurred along with five generous budgets, without any borrowing, for which the Minister is to be commended.</P>
    <P>I welcome, in particular, the budgetary provision of 100,000 for the oldest agricultural show in Ireland, at Piltown in south Kilkenny. I could not let this occasion pass without thanking the Minister for that contribution.</P>
    <P>Within the past few days, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has announced an agreement with the Irish Farmers Association for the acquisition of land for the provision of motorways under the national development plan. That is a job well done and it will expedite the acquisition of lands and the development of motorways which are very necessary.</P>
    <P>The budgetary objectives, as outlined in the Minister for Finance's speech yesterday, are laudable and include the development of our infrastructure. Other budgetary objectives are aimed at improving public services and promoting equity as well as encouraging private enterprise and investment, creating additional jobs and doing so in a way that sustains fiscal policy. The budget safeguards the vulnerable in our society, prioritises our needs and continues to invest for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to again raise the question of the whereabouts of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report on motor insurance costs. I do not think there is any subject on which there is so much confusion as to where the truth lies in the contending arguments about the undisputed very high cost of insurance in this economy. It impacts most negatively on young drivers. Young drivers have to bear an intolerable burden in terms of securing insurance cover, which in some cases is extremely difficult, but in no case is feasible without paying an inordinately high premium. As we and the Minister of State are aware, the business of getting insurance these days is the difference between being able to go to work and not being able to go to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people driving some distance, not least because of the very high price of housing, need insurance cover and yet they are frequently confronted with premiums that seem outrageous, on the face of it. We do not seem to be able to get to the bottom of it. The industry contends one thing, the consumer organisations and others representing young drivers contend the opposite. Every single Member of the House has young people to his or her advice centres and clinics explaining to them that after the cost of purchas<Col N="189" /> ing a car the business of securing insurance cover is beyond their reach.</P>
    <P>The Minister has replied in terms of criticism of the suitability of the MIAB to do the job. That criticism only emerged as a result of the MIAB's interim report which seemed to be critical of the industry and accused it of withholding documents and so on. At the time, I argued for an investigation based on powers to compel the production of documentary evidence and the attendance of witnesses and the Minister said: &ldquo;no, the MIAB is still on the job&rdquo;. In the House on 3 May 2001, he said: &ldquo;I am confident we will produce a good report before the end of the year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister of State taken that report from the MIAB, because this has gone on an unconscionably long time? Young drivers are hurting. I am aware of the record of young male drivers and that the rate of claims is disproportionate to the neighbouring island and other countries but it still seems unfair that for the many thousands of conscientious careful young drivers who need a car to get to their place of work that they cannot afford insurance cover. Is there any remedy for these people in the report, if he has taken it? If he has not taken it, what is the delay and when will he take it? Another PR campaign mounted by the industry recently would seem to suggest, in one reading, that all insurance cover for all kinds of motorists is inherently unprofitable. I do not know and I cannot understand if it is that serious. Certainly no modern economy can function without a system of reasonably priced insurance cover for people who are engaged in the use of motor vehicles for work and pleasure purposes. We have to address this issue. I am using this opportunity to ask the Minister to tell the House where the report is and whether he can offer any hope to young drivers in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appointed the Motor Insurance Advisory Board in September 1998 with a wide membership that is representative of the various groups interested in and affected by motor insurance, including representatives of consumers, commercial motorists, young drivers, the Garda, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Environment and Local Government and our own Department, driver trainers, accident victims, the motor industry and the insurance industry. The board is chaired by Ms Dorothea Dowling, claims manager of Córas Iompair Éireann and one of the board members. One of the board members is a professional statistician.</P>
      <P>The board is in the course of preparing its final report to me on motor insurance issues generally and on the relationship between premiums charged to each category of driver and the claims experience for that category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the ongoing difficulties with receiving and validating data from the industry, I decided to extend the remit of the board until the <Col N="190" /> end of this year to permit it to complete the analysis of the data. There were delays in receipt of data, which in turn delayed the process of validation and analysis of the data. It will be appreciated that validation and analysis of the millions of pieces of data submitted by the industry takes time. I understand progress is being made and that the board's final report and recommendations should be presented to me early in the New Year. When the report is presented to me I will give urgent consideration to the board's recommendations and make appropriate proposals to the Government.</P>
    <P>It is premature to speculate as to the impact the report and the recommendations may have on the cost of insurance for young drivers. European Union law prevents us from intervening in matters of pricing or underwriting of insurance. However, apart from the work of the MIAB, I look forward to progress on addressing the underlying costs of insurance, with a view to improving the cost of motor insurance. In particular, the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board will make a substantial contribution to reducing the delivery costs of personal injury compensation, which now account for up to 40% of the total cost of paying claims.</P>
    <P>I look forward to presenting the report as soon as I receive it and doing an analysis thereon thereafter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming in to take this Adjournment matter. I am disappointed the Ceann Comhairle is not in the Chair because he is the only one who would remember when the first approach was made to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for funding for the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will outline briefly the history of the scheme. As far back as 1965 the consulting engineers prepared a preliminary report for a regional water supply to serve Goresbridge, Paulstown and Kellymount. It sat for a number of years. During that period I became a Member and made representations to many different Ministers for the Environment and Local Government. On 11 February 1982 an updated report was submitted to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It sat again until 28 October 1986 when contract documents were submitted to the Department for approval at an estimated cost of £1,394,000. The scheme was again put on the back burner. On 26 March 1997 the Department of the Environment and Local Government approved funding to carry out source protection of the scheme which was requested on 28 May 1993. This letter also requested Kilkenny County Council to submit updated contract documents for the main scheme which had been submitted on 28 October 1986. In February 2001 the latest revision of contract documents was submitted to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Those facts speak for themselves. <Col N="191" /> For whatever reason, this scheme has been left on the back burner for so long that I despair of it ever getting approval. This large rural area encompasses a small number of villages and towns and the people there have experienced serious water supply shortages over a long number of years. By any yardstick, I am sure the Minister of State would agree they are very patient to have waited so long for a scheme that was originally mooted in 1965. As a good deal of money was available over a period of years, it is difficult to understand that schemes such as this were not approved and funded by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>We encourage people to move to live in rural Ireland. It is a case of Dublin <i>versus</i> the rest. In a county such as Kilkenny, we encourage people to move to the towns and particularly to the capital, Kilkenny city, and there it is a case of Kilkenny <i>versus</i> the rest. Kilkenny is bursting at the seams. The cost of houses has gone sky high and building land is not available. There is plenty of good building land available for people who want to live in a rural area, but the planning process prevents them from doing so as there is no funding available to provide the necessary infrastructure. That relates to several schemes, not just this one. I raised on several occasions in the House the lack of infrastructure such as sewerage facilities and I raised on the Adjournment the need to increase grants for group sewerage schemes, but I seem to be making very little progress.</P>
    <P>There is not much more I can say because the scheme's history speaks for itself. It is time officials in the Department realised there are places called Gowran, Paulstown, Goresbridge and Kellymount and made arrangements to provide the necessary funding to Kilkenny County Council to allow this scheme to proceed after 37 years. That is a reasonable request and one to which I ask the Minister of State to respond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Aylward for raising this matter. The provision of modern environmental infrastructure to support economic objectives has been a major focus of Government investment over the past four and a half years. Total planned spending on water services infrastructure over the period of the current national development plan amounts to almost 4.4 billion. This investment is aimed at supporting economic and social development, employment generation and the achievement of high environmental standards. The additional water production capacity created during last year alone equalled the average daily requirements of a population equivalent to 309,000 persons. This represented, in one year, 36% of the corresponding figure for the entire 1994 to 1999 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002 is the first phase of a rolling pro<Col N="192" /> gramme to give effect to planned NDP spending on water services up to 2006. Total investment proposed for County Kilkenny under the first phase of the programme amounts to just over £31.7 million, 40 million, in respect of ten schemes. Over half of this, almost £19 million, 24 million, is in respect of schemes that will deal with water supplies, in particular to Kilkenny city and south County Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I should clarify the name of the scheme under discussion. I understand that the townland of Kellymount, referred to by the Deputy, incorporates part of Paulstown. No proposals have been submitted by Kilkenny County Council to my Department for a scheme for Kellymount. Any submissions from the council in this regard refer to Gowran-Goresbridge-Paulstown.</P>
    <P>Contract documents for a scheme at Gowran-Goresbridge-Paulstown were submitted to my Department by the council in the mid-1980s but have not been approved. The Deputy will be aware that the current water services investment programme, announced in July 2000, for Kilkenny took into account the list of water and sewerage schemes adopted as priorities by the council at that time. Local authorities were asked to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny County Council submitted an assessment of needs in April 1999; this did not address the need for a scheme for Gowran-Goresbridge-Paulstown. Following a strategic review of water supplies in the county, the council submitted a further assessment of the needs in February 2000. This latest assessment placed a proposal for water conservation, storage reservoir and safety measures for Gowran-Goresbridge-Paulstown at number three on the priority list of 11 schemes for the years 2000 to 2006. This proposal was estimated to cost £552,000, 700,000. The council's priority list of six schemes for the longer term period 2007 to 2020 also includes, as priority number three, work to Gowran-Goresbridge-Paulstown, consisting of mains replacement and extra storage, estimated at £368,000, 467,000.</P>
    <P>The works covered by the contract documents produced in the 1980s, which were updated and resubmitted to my Department in February this year, incorporate the work encompassed by proposals identified in the council's needs assessment, along with other works. The published investment programme for County Kilkenny contains two water supply schemes to advance through planning, the Kilkenny city regional water supply scheme estimated to cost £6.5 million, 8.25 million, and the south Kilkenny water supply scheme, to serve Belview port and estimated to cost £11 million, 14 million. Taking into account the level of competing demand, the need to prioritise individual proposals on a national basis and having regard to statutory and health requirements and developmental needs, these schemes were regarded as the most essen<Col N="193" /> tial in terms of Kilkenny water supply needs when the programme was drawn up.</P>
    <P>The current programme is only the first phase of an investment plan in water services that will be progressively rolled forward up to the end of the NDP in 2006. The proposal for the Gowran-Goresbridge-Paulstown water supply scheme will be considered in the context of the next phase of the programme, in light of the council's identified priorities at the time. The Deputy can also be assured that the points which he has made here this evening will also be taken into account at that stage.</P>

      <P>The information that an illegal dump with hospital waste and industrial waste has been found at Belcamp is extremely worrying. There are serious questions to be asked of a number of people and agencies concerning land ownership. The following questions must also be answered: when the dumping commenced; when it ceased; who did the dumping; did they have a licence or permit as required under EU Waste Regulations, 1979; was planning permission granted to the landowners to allow for dumping; and what went into the dump?</P>
      <P>The area in which this dump was found, although now part of a major road, was originally a narrow country laneway, which was very quiet and generally not often used. It was lightly populated and dumping could have taken place without being observed. The IDA, which seems to be an innocent party, commenced the purchase of five plots of land in this area six years ago and finalised the last deal six months ago.</P>
      <P>Last June, MC O'Sullivan commissioned a study by Ecosafe Systems Limited following the discovery by Pierse Contractors of waste material on two areas of land when they were laying the north fringe sewer for Dublin Corporation. This report was provided to Dublin Corporation yesterday, 5 December, and to the Fingal county manager this morning, 6 December.</P>
      <P>It appears that in 1982 a private waste disposal company approached two landowners to use the land depression of a river to tip material. The problem arises because the private waste disposal company was clearly disposing of hazardous materials such as blood vials, plastic blood infusion pipes, syringes, bedpans and clinical waste. Also found were packing and labelling material from a number of factories in the general area, waste from Dublin Airport, oil drums from mechanical workshops and aeronautical mechanical parts. It appears this dumping ceased in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> I have been informed by the IDA that the two areas affected by this dumping have been closed off and made safe in order that children and other people cannot gain access. Further investigations are continuing to ascertain the identity of the private waste disposer and what the two local people knew about what was being dumped on their lands. Legal advice is also being sought as to what actions, if any, can be taken against the disposal company and-or the landowners. Under the Waste Management Act, 1996, licences are required by people disposing of waste, those who offer their land for such disposal and those operating a dump. Section 59 gives local authorities responsibility for enforcing the Waste Management Act, and section 55 gives powers to local authorities to require those responsible for the land to remove and render safe such land where waste is causing environmental pollution.</P>
    <P>It is not clear yet the full extent of acreage on which dumping took place, but it is interesting to note that before purchasing the land, the IDA carried out trial bore holes and found nothing. Dublin Corporation also carried out bore hole trials before work on the sewer commenced, and it also found nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Owen, for giving me an opportunity to express the alarm and concern of my neighbours and myself about this matter. I am a resident of the area in Clonshaugh-Belcamp and I was shocked to hear that this amazing discovery had been made six months ago, in June. The main concern is that about 100 settled Traveller families live immediately south of this dump site in the Carrapark-Belcamp area, but nearly 4,000 households live alongside in Darndale, Belcamp, Priorswood, Clonshaugh and the Bonnybrook parishes of the Dublin Corporation administrative area. As one of those residents, I am amazed and bitterly disappointed that the city manager, John Fitzgerald, whose staff is directing the north fringe project, did not think it fit to bring this serious discovery to the attention of county councillors at the June meeting of our north central area committee or, at the latest, in the city council in July.</P>
      <P>It is also extraordinary that the north fringe drainage project was restarted in early August with a different type of pipe and concrete supports through the affected territory without city or Fingal councillors being informed. Apparently the pipe was laid through this territory, with the waste material being moved to one side and the pipe being dropped in underneath it. It was then covered up again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both in physical and other terms, this appears to be a serious cover-up. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has a serious responsibility to find out what happened. Deputy Owen, in Fingal County Council, and I in Dublin County Council will ask serious questions of our county and city manager as to the reason we were not informed of this danger at the earliest possible opportunity in June and the reason at least 4,000 households <Col N="195" /> were exposed to this danger for a further six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Owen and Deputy Broughan for raising this matter this evening. I am aware of media reports today concerning the discovery of hospital and other waste on at least part of the 120 acre site at north County Dublin which is owned by the Industrial Development Authority. It has been suggested that this illegally dumped waste dates back to 1992.</P>
      <P>My Department has not received a formal communication from Fingal County Council or the IDA on this matter. I understand that investigations are ongoing to determine the extent of waste disposal on this site and the implications arising, but it would appear that there is no recent dumping associated with the location. Because the site has been in IDA ownership since 1997, it would seem likely that all of the illegal activity concerned predated the Waste Management Act, 1996. Prior to the 1996 Act, each local authority was responsible for the planning, organisation, authorisation and supervision of the waste operations in their functional areas. Similarly, under the 1996 Act, functions in relation to waste regulation and its enforcement have been assigned to local authorities, or in relation to licensing of significant waste activities, to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has no direct function in these matters.</P>
      <P>With regard to unauthorised dumping generally, I share the widespread concern at the more recent cases that have come to light. Such activity is both illegal and grossly irresponsible. Local authorities must employ the necessary resources to ensure that they effectively oversee movement of waste and associated activities within their functional areas and take determined action, utilising the very significant powers and remedies available to them, to counter unauthorised activity.</P>
      <P>To facilitate effective enforcement, environmental authorities have significant powers to enter and inspect lands and premises, and to board vehicles. There are very severe penalties in respect of illegal dumping. A person guilty of such an offence would be liable, upon conviction on indictment, to a fine of up to £10 million and-or up to ten years imprisonment. Even on summary prosecution, significant penalties can arise. This week, a contractor was fined and jailed for a total of 18 months in respect of three offences under the 1996 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A land owner who is complicit in unauthorised dumping could be liable to prosecution in addition to the person disposing of the waste on the land, and could be required to properly dispose of the waste concerned and undertake any necessary environmental remediation. In the event of default, a local authority can act directly <Col N="196" /> and recover the costs involved from the person concerned.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I am taking a number of steps to support local authorities in taking effective action on unauthorised waste activities.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the proposed landfill levy will generate significant revenues, and the Minister intends to direct much of this funding to support local authority enforcement initiatives in the waste area.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that where a local authority uncovers evidence of systematic and large scale dumping, it should be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for an informed decision towards prosecution as a serious offence rather than dealt with as a summary offence. To that end, my Department has consulted the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to prepare guidelines for local authorities regarding relevant procedures and preparation of evidence.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department has formally requested the Criminal Assets Bureau to consider whether, in the public interest, they should investigate the possibility of systematic and illegal profiteering being involved in unauthorised waste dumping.</P>
    <P>Recent regulations on permitting commercial waste collectors will also facilitate better control of waste movements and should prove valuable in combating illegal dumping. Permitting authorities will be entitled to refuse to grant a permit to an applicant found guilty of specified waste offences, including unauthorised dumping, and may revoke a permit that is granted.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the relevant public bodies fully appreciate the seriousness of this problem, that recent cases will be rigorously pursued and that effective action will be taken against those responsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The discovery of natural gas on the Corrib field 38 miles due west of Erris Head has given rise to great hope, controversy and a number of legitimate concerns. One of the groups for which I speak here is the Erris Inshore Fishermen's Association, which has about 150 members and represents fishermen from Blacksod Bay to Ballyglass and Porturlin and its environs. Most of these fishermen have trawlers ranging from 50 feet down in size, with crews of three or four. They have no objection, as such, to bringing natural gas ashore in the national interest but they have a legitimate concern about the proposal by Enterprise Oil to put the discharge pipe from the terminal at Ballinaboy at a point six kilometres west from Glengad Point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The site for the terminal was chosen by Enterprise Oil on the basis of economics and ease of laying grounds. However, due to the canal connection at Belmullet and the flow direction of Achill Sound, Broadhaven and Blacksod Bays do not empty into the open sea on the ebb tide or fill from the open sea on the flow. Broadhaven <Col N="197" /> Bay empties into Blacksod Bay and fills in the reverse direction.</P>
    <P>On a test carried out by Enterprise Oil, the dispersal of the dye from that test was found a considerable distance inside Sruwaddacon Bay, which means that any discharge from the pipe at the point proposed by Enterprise Oil will flow back into Broadhaven Bay. It means also that the scrubbing of the gas at the terminal point will include discharges of mercury, barium, cadmium and cobalt. The produced water will also have a heavy solidity content and regardless of the quantities, this will affect juvenile fish stocks. I assume that as further blocks of seabed are explored in the years ahead, and when other natural gas sources are found, these will be connected to the existing terminal point 38 miles west of Erris Head.</P>
    <P>My point is that the Minister, at least for the moment, is the political protector of the livelihoods of the Erris inshore fishermen who have a very legitimate concern. As Enterprise Oil will lay two pipes from the well 38 miles west to Ballinaboy, it should be feasible, both economically and in the best interests of the fishermen's livelihood, to lay a third pipe, a discharge pipe, back into the well at source. It would mean that none of the contaminated or heavily salinated water would be discharged into Broadhaven Bay. Without the pipe, tidal conditions and the terrain of the land would wash the water back into the bay, inevitably affecting juvenile fish stocks and thus the livelihoods of the fishermen. The laying of a third pipe would also be in line with the OSPAR Convention for best available techniques. In 1999 £5 billion was spent on underwater and seabed technology and the project carried out at Troll in Norway has proven to be a success.</P>
    <P>Mayo County Council has granted planning permission for the terminal, which is being appealed. While we genuinely share the vision and concept of bringing gas ashore, equally, we should take the very legitimate concerns of these 150 fishermen, their families and livelihoods into account. The way to do this effectively and permanently is to bring the discharge pipe back out to the well at source and return the discharge waters to the well from whence they came in the first instance.</P>

      <P>The detailed environmental impact statement, EIS, submitted to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, by Enterprise Energy Ireland on behalf of the company and its partners, Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited and Marathon International Petroleum (Hibernia) Limited was placed in the public domain by the company for consideration by interested parties which have until 27 December next to make written submissions or observations to the Minister. The company was also required to furnish the EIS to bodies prescribed in law, which also have until 27 December to provide written comments <Col N="198" /> to the Minister. Written submissions or observations received within the period will be referred to the company for comment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should be aware of the special public meeting arranged by the Minister which is taking place in Teach Iorrais, Geesala, this evening. It will be attended by representatives of the expert marine licence vetting committee and will report to the Minister. It will advise local people as to how to make submissions or observations on the EIS. To maximise the benefit to be derived from it, the meeting was arranged for approximately halfway through the consultation process on the EIS. In making written submissions or observations interested persons should clearly identify adverse effects they expect to arise from the project and how they should be addressed.</P>
      <P>The EIS, together with submissions or observations and the company's comment thereon, will be fully and independently examined by the marine licence vetting committee with the assistance of consultants. The committee will report to the Minister in due course to allow him to make a decision and its report will be published. Until this examination has been completed, the Minister will not be in a position to take a view on whether the EIS is acceptable, or comment on the likely effects of the project on investment by fishermen or other persons in the area.</P>
      <P>The Minister has asked me to assure the Deputy that if he gives the go-ahead for the project, it would be subject to detailed conditions to address any likely adverse impacts. In granting a petroleum lease for the project on 16 November 2001 under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, the Minister made it clear that the development of the reservoir could not commence until after he had approved a detailed plan of development and that the project would require the following authorisations from him: a foreshore licence under the Foreshore Acts, 1933 to 1998, to cover development on the foreshore, including pipeline laying; consent for the construction of the pipeline under the Gas Acts, 1976 to 2000; and consent to construct sub-sea structures under the Continental Shelf Act, 1968.</P>
      <P>All sub-sea facilities would be controlled and monitored from the onshore terminal via an electronic hydraulic remote control system. Following processing in the terminal, the gas will flow through a transmission pipeline to connect to the natural gas ring main at Craughwell in the heart of south Galway. In addition to the plan of development application, the applications for a foreshore licence and consent to construct the pipeline are required to be accompanied by an EIS, as described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, the EIS is intended to cover all elements of the project from the wells, including the onshore terminal. In addition to the foregoing, planning permission must be secured from An Bord Pleanála for the onshore terminal at Ballinaboy Bridge and an integrated pollution <Col N="199" /> control licence from the Environmental Protection Agency, a process which will also involve a separate statutory consultation process. No gas can be produced in the Corrib gas field without specific approval from the Minister, which is known as consent for first gas and can only be given when the Minister is satisfied that all the authorisations to which I have referred have been secured and there is full compliance with all the conditions therein.</P>
    <P>The successful bringing into production of the Corrib gas field would bring significant commercial and strategic benefits to the economy as a whole and also serve as an important component in the economic development of the west, facilitating the supply of natural gas for the very first time to domestic, commercial and industrial users in the region, including making gas available for power generation.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has made a very reasonable case and explained to the House the various move<Col N="200" /> ments in tidal flow and the interconnection between the bays in this very beautiful part of the country. We should adopt a positive attitude because the conditions attaching to mineral development and the exploitation of natural resources in this country are such that we must efficiently exploit them economically and ensure they are environmentally correct for the country, the people and our natural environment. I will recommend to the Minister that he takes on board the Deputy's request.</P>
    <P>The lease issued last month is the only one issued under either the Department's 1975 or 1992 licensing terms and effectively the first new production lease issued in the last 30 years. As such, it represents a milestone in Irish offshore exploration and production and confirms the Government's long-standing commitment to exploiting the natural resources of our country for the benefit of our people.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 7 December 2001.</P>

      <P>The need to safeguard water supplies has been the subject of a series of guidelines, over the years, by my Department to local authorities, which are responsible for the management and operation of water supply infrastructure, and for the first line response to any incident that would affect the security and quality of supply to the public.</P>
      <P>These departmental guidelines for ensuring the safety and security of water supply systems are periodically reviewed in response to new circumstances and continue to be developed in light of emerging threats. The action plans of the local authorities, adopted in accordance with the guidelines, form part of the major emergency plans and will be activated as part of the response to an emergency.</P>
      <P>In the light of recent events, local authorities were asked to review their major emergency plans and local plans, including plans for security and protection of water resources and drinking water supplies, to ensure that they were up to date and effective.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 40 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Draft regulations to introduce a levy on plastic shopping bags were released for public consultation on 18 September last. These propose that <Col N="202" /> the levy, to be charged at 15 cent per bag with effect from 4 February 2002, will apply to all plastic bags suitable for use by customers at point of sale in retail outlets, with certain specified exemptions such as smaller bags used for non-packaged fresh food products. Provision is not made for an exemption for degradable bags, as the levy proposals have a strong anti-litter emphasis.</P>
    <P>A two-month consultation period was provided to give interested parties an opportunity to make comments or observations in relation to the draft regulations. A number of interested parties have sought changes to, or exemptions from, the regulations. For this reason, it is neither desirable nor appropriate for me to address any specific submission in advance of final decisions in relation to all submissions that have been received. I am now considering all submissions made and I intend to make the final regulations shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The results of the statutory assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 1999 indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. From ongoing contacts with local authorities my Department estimates that needs may have increased by some 20% between March 1999 and March 2001. An accurate estimate of the position will be established by the next statutory assessment of housing needs, due to be undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 2002 in accordance with detailed guidelines to be issued by my Department shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authority housing output, including both new building and acquisitions, is expected to reach some 5,000 units this year compared to 3,207 units last year. Voluntary housing output this year should be the highest level ever recorded at about 1,200 units compared to 951 last year and 579 in 1999. The Government is <Col N="204" /> fully aware of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given to tackling this need through the local authority housing programme and other important complementary initiatives. I am confident that the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme, together with the increased output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of around 11,000 households to be met this year.</P>
    <P>The total number of households to be provided with accommodation under the various social housing programmes this year &ndash; 11,000 &ndash; represents between 20% and 25% of the total numbers on the waiting lists. The extent of the impact on the total numbers on the waiting lists will not be clearly known until the results of the coming statutory assessment of needs are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 23 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>Under planning legislation, each planning authority is obliged to prepare a development plan setting out an overall strategy for the planning and development of its area. Such plans would include the policy of the authority in relation to the provision of one-off single houses. Decisions on individual applications are also a matter for each authority in accordance with its development plan or for An Bord Pleanála in the case of an appeal. I have no proposals for amendment of these legislative provisions.</P>
      <P>As regards single houses in rural areas, it is essential that the farming community and those working on the land should be able to live in the country. However, a continuation of the current trends in one-off housing, particularly with regard to urban generated development, that is, development by those from and working in urban areas, will have significant implications in terms of a range of issues such as transport, the possibilities for strengthening many of our towns and villages, landscape and tourism and protection of ground and surface waters. All off these issues will be further considered in the context of the national spatial strategy now being finalised. The report &ldquo;Sustainable Development &ndash; A Strategy for Ireland&rdquo;, published in 1997, indicated that in general there should be a presumption against urban-generated, one-off rural housing adjacent to towns.</P>
      <P>I have not had discussions with An Taisce regarding housing in rural areas. My Department did receive a submission from An Taisce arising from the recent consultation process on the emerging indications as to how more balanced regional development might be achieved in Ireland. The submission from An Taisce included comments on development in the countryside including the issue of one-off housing. All of the responses received during this consultation process are being carefully considered, within the process now under way of further developing proposals for inclusion in the national spatial strategy itself.</P>
      <P>As regards a possible organised campaign of objection to rural housing, all planning appellants are by law required to state the subject matter and full grounds of their appeal and the reasons, considerations and arguments on which these are based. An Bórd Pleanála has an absolute discretion to dismiss an appeal where it is of the opinion that the appeal is vexatious, frivolous or without substance or foundation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The prevention of personation at elections is an important protection of the democratic process, and I have accordingly been keeping the operation of personation provisions under review.</P>
      <P>These provisions allow a presiding officer of his or her own volition, or if so required by a personation agent, to request any person applying for a ballot paper to satisfy them as to their identity by producing any one of a number of specified documents. A person may also be required to answer certain prescribed questions, take an oath or make an affirmation as to their identity. Where a person fails to produce such a document or the presiding officer is not satisfied that the person is the person to whom the document relates, a ballot paper is not issued. Presiding officers have powers to direct a member of the Garda Síochána to arrest a person where they have reasonable cause to believe that personation is or has been committed and electoral law also provides for the offence of personation and appropriate penalties.</P>
      <P>In relation to the consideration of applications for entry to the supplement to the register of electors, comprehensive advice has issued from my Department to registration authorities. For each such application, authorities have been advised to check basic eligibility criteria, seek further information from the applicant and consult with the enumerator for the area if necessary. While authorities are encouraged to rule on applications as soon as possible, a decision should not be made until they have completed all the enquiries considered necessary. Furthermore, in considering applications, registration authorities are empowered to require a person to furnish additional information, to produce a certificate of birth or naturalisation or to make a statutory declaration. As with personation, electoral law provides for offences and penalties in relation to the registration of electors.</P>
      <P>In any consideration of electoral procedures, there is a balance to be struck between facilitating eligible persons to vote and protecting the system from electoral abuse and it is in this context that the operation of the existing controls will be monitored and improved, where necessary.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for protecting water against pollution arising from the landspreading of agricultural waste rests with the person carrying on the landspreading activity. It is also an offence under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts for a person to cause or permit polluting matter to enter waters, directly or indirectly. It is an offence under the Waste Management Acts for a person to hold, recover or dispose of waste in a manner which causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution.

      <P>Primary responsibility among public authorities for the protection and improvement of water quality is assigned to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related legislation. Powers are available under the Acts to local authorities to serve advice, prevention or warning notices. Some local authorities have made bye-laws to protect water quality against pollution caused by agricultural activities.</P>
      <P>The environmental protection agency has relevant powers and duties in the context of its licensing and other functions under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992. The EPA's IPC licensing system has been progressively extended in recent years to apply to intensive pig-rearing and poultry-rearing installations.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development promotes good agricultural practice in the context of the REP scheme and the administration of agri-assistance schemes generally.</P>
      <P>In the context of ongoing implementation of EU and national waste legislation, I am examining the need for additional, enforceable statutory controls in relation to the recovery of animal manure and related agricultural activities. The recovery of such organic wastes is generally exempted from the licensing requirements of the Waste Management Act, 1996, and is not yet the subject of general statutory provisions which directly address these activities. Draft regulations in preparation in my Department at present will address issues such as the landspreading of slurry, the storage of organic waste and related agricultural activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of ongoing implementation of Directive 91/676/EEC &ndash; the Nitrates Directive &ndash; there is a need to develop and implement action programmes to protect water quality against pollution by agricultural activities, with a primary emphasis on better management of manures and other fertilisers. These action programmes must be implemented in relation to the whole country or to areas designated as &lsquo;vulnerable zones' ie areas where waters are significantly affected by nitrates from agriculture. I will shortly <Col N="208" /> finalise proposals as to the areas to which the directive will be applied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 non-national road grant allocations to Cork County Council have increased by 70% from £16.3 million, 20.7 million, in 1997 to £27.9 million, 35.4 million, in 2001. The 2001 allocation is an increase of 20% on the 2000 payment figure of £23.27 million, 29.546 million.</P>
      <P>In determining non-national road grant allocations, the primary objective is to ensure that all local authorities, including Cork County Council, are appropriately resourced in relation to their ongoing and special needs. This process is guided by a range of criteria, including road pavement conditions, traffic volumes, length of road network and suitability in relation to criteria for EU co-financing. This multiplicity of criteria, together with the variable impact of project specific schemes on expenditure from year to year, necessarily entails divergence between local authorities in grants per kilometre under the non-national roads programme. In addition, allocations made under the grant category &ndash; non-national roads to support housing and other development, particularly to counties in the greater Dublin area, where there is a significant demand for housing, further complicate comparisons on the basis of the length of the non-national road network in each county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for Cork County Council to prioritise within the context of the grant allocated the works to be carried out within the overall county. It is the intention that the funding being provided to Cork County Council will, in conjunction with the council's own resources, facilitate the improvement of the non-national road network in County Cork, including West Cork. My Department has no proposals to re-classify the existing regional or local roads in West Cork including the Enniskeane-Bandon Road. A sub<Col N="209" /> mission from Cork County Council seeking additional funding under the restoration programme is being examined in the context of the 2002 non-national road grant allocations which I intend to announce early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Details of the Government's proposals for major reforms in the private rented sector were announced on 5 January 2001 in response to the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector. The Government accepted all of the commission's recommendations other than those relating to capital acquisitions tax and with some modification of those relating to interest deductibility and capital gains tax rollover relief. It was also decided that landlords should only have to comply with one registration requirement rather than the dual requirement recommended by the commission.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress has since been made in implementing the commission's recommendations. A number of measures relating to tax and supply incentives were introduced in the Finance Act, 2001. These included a reduction in the stamp duty rate for new residential investment properties, tax relief on rental income in respect of refurbishment capital expenditure, the re-introduction of interest relief on borrowings in the case of certain properties meeting specified conditions and rollover relief on capital gains tax in respect of qualifying reinvestment in the sector.</P>
      <P>The Government announcement envisaged a two year timeframe to reach the stage of enacted legislation and indicated that the Private Residential Tenancies Board would be set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis pending the enactment of the legislation to establish it statutorily. My Department is working to this schedule and, accordingly, the <i>ad hoc</i> board was activated in October. At present, it is in the process of setting up its operational procedures and structures and it expects to be in a position in early 2002 to commence accepting disputes referred to it on a voluntary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Implementation of the other reforms approved by Government requires new legislation, including amendments to the existing landlord and tenant legislative code. The general scheme of a Bill, which I hope to be in a position to submit for <Col N="210" /> Government approval early in the new year, is being finalised in collaboration with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has responsibility for the landlord and tenant legislative code. This, when enacted, will allow for the implementation of a four year security of tenure measure, revised tenancy termination provisions with graduated notice periods, explicit tenancy obligations applying to landlords and tenants, rent setting and review provisions and new tenancy registration requirements. It will also provide on a statutory basis for the Private Residential Tenancies Board, which will be available to deal with all disputes arising between landlords and tenants and provide advice and information in relation to the rented sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 34 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that Wicklow County Council is currently dealing with two cases involving the unauthorised disposal of health care waste, and it is suspected that there may be a third site where such waste may have been disposed of. There are reports in the media today of the discovery of hospital waste dumped at a location in north Dublin. I am not aware of any other such cases over the past year.</P>
      <P>The possibility of contamination of ground and surface waters is an obvious concern in such cases. I understand that there is currently no evidence of water contamination arising from the sites identified in Wicklow. I am not currently aware of the circumstances of the Dublin site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the general concern regarding these and other instances of unauthorised dumping of <Col N="211" /> waste. Such activity is both illegal and grossly irresponsible. Dumping of clinical waste is, because of its nature, particularly reprehensible. Under section 59 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, each local authority is responsible for the supervision and enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the holding, recovery or disposal of waste within its functional area. Local authorities must deploy the necessary resources to ensure that they effectively oversee waste movements and activities within their functional areas and take immediate action, utilising the very significant powers and remedies available to them under the 1996 Act, to counter unauthorised activity.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the proposed landfill levy early next year will generate significant revenues, and it is my intention to make a large proportion of this funding directly available to local authorities to support dedicated and measurable enforcement initiatives aimed at controlling fly-tipping and unauthorised waste activities. I have asked the City and County Managers Association to submit proposals to me in this regard.</P>
    <P>Recent legislation will facilitate better control of waste movements and should prove valuable in combating illegal dumping of waste. Under the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations, 2001, commercial waste collectors were required to apply to local authorities for a waste collection permit before 30 November. Local authorities can require permit holders to ensure that waste collected is transferred only to an authorised waste facility, and to maintain detailed records in relation to the quantity and nature of wastes collected, and the manner in which it is dealt with. A local authority is entitled to refuse to grant a collection permit, or to revoke one that had been granted, in the event that an applicant or permittee is found guilty of any one of a number of specified waste offences, including unauthorised dumping.</P>
    <P>As an immediate step, my Department has formally requested the Criminal Assets Bureau to consider whether, in the public interest, they should investigate the possibility of systematic and illegal profiteering being involved in unauthorised waste dumping.</P>

      <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the National Roads Authority &ndash; NRA &ndash; under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act, 2000. I am aware of the proposal referred to in the question. The proposal to waive tolls at certain times would require an amendment to the relevant tolling agreement, which would be a matter for the NRA to consider in the first instance given their statutory role and powers.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the Exchequer could subsidise the peak-hour zero toll proposal by foregoing some of the gross toll revenue &ndash; GTR &ndash; share which is received by the Exchequer. This GTR share arrangement is set out in the tolling agreement, which is a legal agreement between the operator of the tolling facility, National Toll Roads plc &ndash; NTR &ndash; and NRA and any amendment of which would be a matter for the bodies concerned to consider. As the NRA is the body which is statutorily competent in this area and given that a legally binding agreement is involved between the NRA and NTR, I do not consider it be appropriate to express an opinion at this stage on the merits of this proposal.</P>

      <P>The commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to improve voter participation is being progressed as part of my Department's ongoing responsibility for the administration and improvement of electoral law and through extended advertising campaigns relating to the register of electors. The Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2001, addresses barriers to voter registration and voting that exist within the current system and provides for a range of issues which will make a positive contribution to encouraging voter participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the measures included in the Act are provisions for photographs and party emblems on ballot papers, earlier opening of polling stations, the display of a large print copy of ballot papers in polling buildings, additional information on polling cards, companion voting for persons with literacy difficulties, voting by poll workers and provision that a registered voter who changes address during the life of a register of electors can apply for entry in the supplement. In addition, <Col N="213" /> the Act provides a statutory basis for the introduction of electronic voting and vote counting, the system for which is currently undergoing extensive testing.</P>
    <P>My Department, as part of the PPF initiative, has also undertaken extended publicity campaigns in 2000 and 2001 to promote voter registration. The campaign in 2000 specifically targeted young people and disadvantaged communities and stressed the importance of registration, the key dates in the registration process and how to get on the register and supplement. The budget for this year's campaign was increased by 70% and involved an innovative TV, flyposter and on-line media campaign.</P>
    <P>While I am satisfied with the progress made to date, my Department will continue to keep under review measures which will contribute to improving voter participation.</P>

      <P>The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which were published on 25 March 1999, are assigned to provide a long-term strategic planning framework for the development of the greater Dublin area. They were commissioned by the Dublin and mid-east regional authorities and their constituent local authorities. The question as to whether any change should be made to the strategic planning guidelines is primarily one for the Dublin and mid-east regional authorities.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, the relevant provisions of which were commenced on 1 January 2001, requires that where a regional authority has made regional planning guidelines, it shall, not later than six years after the making of such guidelines and not less than once in every period of six years thereafter, review such guidelines and when so reviewing, it may revoke the guidelines or make new regional planning guidelines.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive statistical analysis of road accidents is provided by the National Roads Authority in its annual road accident facts reports, which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The NRA 2000 report carries a Garda estimate that at least 42% of the 362 fatal accidents which occurred in that year involved contributory action on the part of a driver. Reports relating to previous years indicate a broadly similar pattern.</P>
      <P>NRA road accident facts reports do not include information regarding the licence status of drivers involved in road accidents. However, a special NRA report entitled, Young Driver Accidents 1997, published in May 2000, is available in the Oireachtas Library. It includes limited details on the licence status of young drivers involved in road accidents where this information was available to the Garda. Within the constraints of this available information, which covered only 52% of young drivers involved in accidents, the report found that 38% of young car drivers and 65% of young motorcycle drivers injured in accidents, held provisional licences. This limited analysis relates only to drivers between the ages of 17 and 24 and not to provisional licence holders generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 21 November I launched a pre-Christmas road safety campaign which was organised by the National Safety Council in co-operation with the Garda. This will see a period of intensified enforcement and promotion of road safety focusing on the three key areas of drink driving, speeding and seat belt wearing in the lead up to the Christmas period.</P>
      <P>The Government has set a target to reduce by 25% the number of fatal accidents occurring between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. These accidents are commonly drink related. Information for 2000 shows a 17% reduction compared to 1997 in the number of fatal road accidents occurring between these hours.</P>
      <P>The level of detection by the Garda Síochána for drink driving has been steadily increasing in recent years. The number of detections in 2000 at 10,433 represents a 24% increase on 1998. More than 10,700 drink driving detections were made to the end of October 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Road Traffic Bill, 2001, which is being debated in the House, extends the grounds on which a member of the Garda Síochána may require a driver to provide a preliminary breath specimen to include situations where a driver is involved in a road accident or where the Garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed. This is in addition to the present grounds where the Garda has formed an opinion <Col N="221" /> that a driver has consumed alcohol. Breath testing on the more selective basis provided for in the Bill is an effective and targeted manner in which we can use the resources available to us and equates to standard practice in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Evidential breath testing, EBT, involves the determination of alcohol concentration in expired breath. EBT was operational in four Garda stations by the end of 1999 and in 25 stations by the end of 2000. The EBT system is being extended to more stations throughout the country during 2001 and it is intended to bring the total in operation to 40 by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The National Safety Council's drink driving campaign, called SHAME, forcefully presents a message that drinking and driving carries high risk consequences and is socially shameful. Pre and post-testing of this campaign indicates a significant positive shift in attitude in the targeted groups and in the wider community towards the issue of drink driving.</P>
    <P>The increased levels of enforcement which the Garda has put in place, advertising campaigns such as those carried out by the National Safety Council and the proposed move to selective random breath testing will strengthen the fight against drink driving.</P>

      <P>Directive 91/676/EEC, the Nitrates Directive, has the objectives of reducing water pollution induced by nitrates from agricultural sources and preventing further such pollution, with the primary emphasis being on the management of manures and other fertilisers. The directive requires member states to establish a code of practice for farmers, carry out monitoring of nitrate levels in waters and develop and implement action programmes to reduce and prevent pollution of waters by nitrates. These action programmes must be implemented in relation to the whole territory of the member state or to areas designated by the member state as vulnerable zones, that is, areas where waters are significantly affected by nitrates from agriculture.</P>
      <P>A number of areas in five counties, Carlow, Cork, Kerry, Louth and Waterford, have been identified as appropriate for designation as nitrate vulnerable zones on the basis of affected groundwaters. Further consideration is being given by an expert panel to the full extent of areas, by reference to surface waters and groundwaters, to which appropriate action programmes should be applied. The panel comprises officials of my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Geological Survey of Ireland and Teagasc. I will shortly finalise proposals as to the areas to which the directive will be applied.</P>

      <P>The rights of tenants of such accommodation and the protection available to them are in the first place governed by the terms of the lease or other agreement under which the tenancies are held. These are subject to the provisions of the landlord and tenant code, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

      <P>Government proposals for major reforms in the private rented sector, arising from the recommendations of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector, were announced on 5 January 2001. These reforms include improved security of tenure arrangements and the establishment of a Private Rented Residential Tenancies Board to deal primarily with disputes between landlord and tenants. Pending the enactment of the legislation required to give statutory effect to the reforms, I set up the Private Residential Tenancies Board on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in October.

    <P>In the case of security of tenure, it is proposed to grant a tenant, whose tenancy has not been terminated in the first six months, a right to continue in occupation for the remainder of a four year period, unless the landlord needs to recover possession for specified reasons such as for own or family member occupation, to sell or to redevelop etc. Successive four year tenancy periods are envisaged, during the first six months of each of which the tenancy may be terminated without cause. A graduated notice period, related to the length of the tenancy, will apply, ranging from a minimum of four weeks, 28 days, to a maximum of 16 weeks, 112 days. Rents will be no greater than the market rate and reviews will take place no more than once a year unless there has been a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation. The implementation of these provisions will result in a major step forward for the private rented residential sector with improved <Col N="224" /> security of tenure for tenants and greater certainty for landlords.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have a wide range of powers to secure accommodation for persons who are homeless, whether as a result of eviction or otherwise. In addition to the direct provision of housing, local authorities can make arrangements with voluntary organisations to make accommodation available for homeless people, provide financial or other assistance to homeless people and, if necessary, arrange alternative private accommodation.</P>
    <P>Under the Government's homeless strategy, local authorities and health boards are drawing up local action plans to deal with all aspects of homelessness. The plans for the main urban areas have been completed and are now being implemented.</P>

      <P>My Department arranges, through local authorities, an annual count of Traveller families. This count is undertaken on the last Friday of each November. The annual count is a statistical return which identifies the number of Traveller families in various types of accommodation and on the roadside. It does not identify the type of accommodation required by such families.</P>
      <P>Under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, local authorities are required, not less frequently than every three years, to assess general housing needs in their areas, including the needs of Traveller families. Section 6 of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, requires local authorities, when making this assessment, to include an assessment of the need for permanent and transient halting sites. The next statutory assessment of housing need will take place in March 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of road deaths in 2000 was 415. This is a 12% decrease on the 1997 level of 472. In 2000, 1,640 people were seriously injured on our roads, which represents a 24.8% reduction on 1997 levels. Provisional returns for this year show that 372 people have been killed on the roads to 3 December compared with 387 for the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The Government is strongly pursuing the implementation of its Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002, the first ever national road safety strategy to be adopted by the Government. The strategy has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety, whose first progress report, July 1999, second progress report, August 2000, and third progress report, July 2001, detail progress with key actions. Copies of these reports have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The third progress report shows that real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the Government strategy. The level of roads deaths reduced by 12.1% between 1997 and 2000, and serious injuries decreased in the 1997-2000 period by almost 25% relative to a reduction target of 20% by end 2002. The interim targets fixed by the strategy for achievement by 2000 have been exceeded.</P>
      <P>Progress is also ahead of target in extending low cost accident measures across the national road network, with 268 schemes completed by end 2000 and a further 88 approved. On the other hand, surveys have shown that considerable improvement will be needed in order to achieve road safety targets for reducing speeding and increasing seat belt wearing. Drink driving, despite stricter enforcement, also remains a major problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Garda enforcement activity has been intensified and improved in accordance with the road safety strategy. Over 224,000 on the spot fines issued in relation to speeding offences in 2000, compared to 175,000 in 1999 and 130,000 in 1998. Fixed speed cameras are in operation on four of the main national routes out of Dublin and on the M50. Speed limit enforcement is also being supported by an increase in mobile speed detection, the use of laser speed detection as well as in-car and motorcycle cameras. At the end of 2000, approximately 84,000 on the spot fines had been issued for non-wearing of seat belts since the introduction of this measure in July 1999. The number of detections for drink driving in 2000 <Col N="226" /> increased by 24% over 1998. EBT was operational in 25 Garda stations by end 2000 and it is intended to extend this to 40 stations by the end of 2001.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy also provided for the implementation of a penalty points system in support of road safety enforcement. The Road Traffic Bill, 2001, which will provide the statutory basis for this measure, is currently before the House. My Department is also working to ensure the availability of a national driver file, complete with penalty points functionality, within the present year.</P>
    <P>Ensuring compliance with the targets of the road safety strategy commands the full effort and support of the Government and its agencies. By reference to the estimates set out in the strategy in 1998, over 100 lives are now being saved each year as a result of implementing the strategy compared to a continuation of trends prior to 1998.</P>

    <P>The need for children to develop good road safety habits at the earliest possible age was recognised in the Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002. In the second progress report issued in July 2000 on the Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002, the high level group on road safety recommended that vulnerable road users, including children, be added as a further area of focus for the strategy and additional measures and resources should be directed at this new target area.</P>
    <P>The National Safety Council was assigned the lead role by the Government strategy for road safety for the development of a resource pack on road safety for input into the social, personal, health and education programme in the new primary school curriculum. The resource pack, Be Safe, was launched in September 2000 and more than 30,000 copies of the pack have been distributed to primary school teachers, principals and boards of management.</P>
    <P>The NSC has also developed a secondary school transition year resource project on road safety. This resource was pilot tested in 20 secondary schools throughout the country and was launched on 10 September 2001. It will complement existing activities in secondary schools.</P>

      <P>The need for a particular focus on vulnerable road users, including cyclists, was a specific recommendation of the high level group on road safety in its second progress report on the Government strategy for road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual road accident facts report prepared by the National Roads Authority reveals that in the last six years 119 cyclists have died as a result of traffic accidents, of which 37 were killed in Dublin. In 2000, the number of cyclists killed was ten which is the lowest number of fatalities reported in 40 years and comprises just 2.4% of all fatalities compared to 8% a decade ago. Of <Col N="229" /> these ten fatalities, I understand five were in respect of accidents involving goods vehicles with two of those occurring in Dublin.</P>
    <P>My Department, in association with the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, has published a design manual for cycle facilities entitled, <i>Provision of Cycle Facilities &ndash; National Manual for Urban Areas, March 1998</i>, which was circulated to all local authorities. The manual is intended to assist local authorities to provide cycle facilities to a uniform and high standard. Ensuring the safety of cyclists was an important consideration in developing the manual, which drew on international practice, particularly from the Netherlands and the UK.</P>
    <P>The manual sets out comprehensive guidelines for the design and provision of cycle facilities, specifically addresses the need for continuity in relation to cycle facilities and shows examples where this can be achieved with particular reference to the question of continuity through junctions and at pinch points. The DTO is now <Col N="230" /> reviewing the cycle manual in the light of experience since 1998. All of the reports mentioned are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The declined cases agreement was established in 1981, between the then Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism and the authorised motor insurance companies. A committee composed of representatives of all insurers who are party to the agreement, and chaired by the Irish <Col N="231" /> Insurance Federation &ndash; IIF, was established to administer the agreement.</P>
      <P>The procedure is that before a case may be considered under the agreement, it is necessary to forward five written refusals from motor insurers directly to the Irish Insurance Federation indicating the order in which the companies were approached together with details, where applicable, of previous insurance held.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in some instances, motorists have experienced difficulty in receiving letters of refusal. However, I have been assured by the IIF that, since written refusals are required in order for a case to be considered, it is incumbent on insurance companies to provide those refusals on request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In August of this year I visited Brazil and was accompanied by the chairman of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara &ndash; BIM &ndash; and a fisherman from Galway. Four leading and prominent fishing industry representatives were invited to accompany me to look at the opportunities for the industry in general. However, owing to unscheduled business commitments, three people were subsequently unable to travel.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the trip was to explore fishing opportunities in Brazil for Irish vessels, to investigate boat building options with Brazilian shipyards, to examine exporting opportunities to Europe, particularly within the whitefish sector, and to look at best practice in the Brazilian catching and processing sectors. The trip had been under consideration since July and was confirmed in August, with travel arrangements being finalised in the week preceding departure.</P>
      <P>To date my Department has met my air travel costs amounting to £4,112.17. My accommodation expenses have not yet been paid by my Department but will be done so shortly. I will forward the details to the Deputy in due course. A further £1,591.56 was paid for translation and consultancy services in consultation with the Irish consular services in Brazil. BIM met the travel and accommodation costs of its chairman. In relation to the fisherman, I am informed by BIM that they met 40% of the travel costs incurred by him.</P>
      <P>A copy of the itinerary of the visit is included for the Deputy's information and I will make arrangements to forward a copy of a report of the trip to the Deputy in due course.</P>

As the responsibility for the cost of the trip rests with BIM I have asked the board to reply directly to the Deputy on the specific details.</P>
      <P>The Department officials who accompanied me were Ms Julie O'Neill, Secretary General, Mr. Maurice Mullen, principal officer with responsibility for aquaculture policy and Mr. Eamonn Confey, private secretary to the Minister. Mr. Pat Keogh, chief executive officer and Mr. Pat Ridge, chairman of BIM also participated. The fish farmer was Mr. John O'Carroll who is chairman of the marine farmers group of the Irish Salmon Growers' Association.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 73 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware the Port of Waterford Company is statutorily responsible under the Harbours Act, 1996, for the management, control, operation and development of the harbour as a commercial State port company. I have sought a report from the port company in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy and I am advised as follows: A settlement offer of £200,000 together with costs was made to the Cheekpoint fishermen with a view to resolving these actions <Col N="234" /> without any further court hearings. I am advised that it was made quite clear to the plaintiff's representatives that the port would not involve itself in the distribution of funds and that each fisherman would have to agree to the distribution of funds between themselves and &ldquo;sign off&rdquo; by way of a discharge or waiver form.</P>
    <P>The port company further informs me that the plaintiffs appointed Mr. Tom Greene to act as arbitrator and that the arbitration has taken place. The matter of deductions from individual payments and the amount of compensation made are matters appropriate to the arbitrator and-or the plaintiffs' legal advisers.</P>
    <P>I am advised that a settlement agreement has now been signed by the plaintiffs' legal representatives and the port company which will, subject to the terms of this agreement, enable the settlement to be paid to the said legal advisers. As regards the issue raised by the Deputy regarding the appointment of drift net fishermen representatives, this dates back to 1992 and involved Waterford Harbour Commissioners as the predecessor body to the Port of Waterford Company and representatives of fisherman from Cheekpoint.</P>
    <P>The Port of Waterford Company has informed me that it has no knowledge or had no involvement in the appointment of the representatives of the driftnet fishermen.</P>
    <P>As stated in previous replies to the Deputy, in the course of protracted negotiations, no objections were raised to those representing the fishermen and in these circumstances the port authority conducted negotiations and agreed the eventual settlement in good faith and in the belief that the negotiators were representatives of all the effected parties.</P>
    <P>I trust that this finally clarifies the position for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The product under reference is an ethical prescription medication authorised for use by the Medicines Board.</P>
      <P>The product is a lipase inhibitor, acting upon digestive enzymes so that fat absorption is reduced. It is indicated in obese patients who have a body mass index &ndash; BMI &ndash; in excess of 30kg\m2, or overweight patients with associated risk factors such as diabetes or hypertension. Treatment may commence after the patient demonstrates an ability to markedly restrict fat in their diet by dietary weight loss of at least 2.5 kg over four consecutive weeks. The product assists continued weight loss by further reducing dietary fat intake and aids the patient to retain his or her dietary habits.</P>
      <P>Since 1994 the Defence Forces have been actively pursuing a policy of increased personal fitness and maintenance of an appropriate weight to height ratio as indicated by BMI. The maximal BMI acceptable for members of the Defence Forces to undertake their fitness assessments is 30. Personnel whose BMI is in excess of 35 are liable to discharge as being below Defence Forces medical standards.</P>
      <P>While individual metabolic rates are variable, the employment consequences of sustained obesity for a member of the Defence Forces are uniquely serious. The most valuable resources of the Defence Forces are trained military personnel. Resources invested in correcting a remediable condition such as obesity can be a more efficient solution overall than discharge and replacement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The product was first ordered by base medical stores in April 1999. I am advised that 38 Defence Forces personnel have been prescribed the prod<Col N="237" /> uct since its authorisation by the Irish Medicines Board approximately three years ago.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have, for many years, taken a very proactive approach in relation to the maintenance of personal fitness and a healthy lifestyle within the military community. The provision of this prescription medication to a very small minority of personnel, where it is properly indicated, is part of this programme. The military medical authorities have advised that it is medically ethical and cost-effective.</P>

      <P>An application under the scheme of alternative enterprises, housing-handling facilities, was received from the person named in the local office of my Department in Waterford on 12 March. When the application was examined a number of defects were found. In addition, further clarification is necessary from the applicant in relation to other information indicated in his application.</P>
      <P>I will now list some of the defects found and information that requires further clarification. The application states 0.75 hectares owned and nine hectares rented. The applicant's area aid declaration for 2001 shows 5.5 hectares farmed. The exact area owned must be clarified. Proposed investment works require planning permission and plans for a dung stead were not included in the application. A dung stead is essential for animal waste storage in respect of this application. An agreed assessment of tax liability issued by the Revenue Commissioners for tax year ended 5 April was omitted. If the applicant cannot obtain this document in the near future alternative documentation may be submitted as follows: an income tax computation-statement of the computation-accounts for tax year, ended 5 April and certified by an accountant-tax consultant; or if the applicant is a PAYE taxpayer his P60 for the tax year ended 5 April, together with a letter from his accountant-tax consultant confirming that he had no other off-farm income for the tax year mentioned.</P>
      <P>The application has been returned to the person named. If his agricultural consultant-planner rectifies the errors indicated and provides satisfactory clarification in relation to the other information sought, it will be open to the applicant to resubmit his application to my Department where it will be examined again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Scrapie has been present in sheep here for some 200 years and there is a low incidence of it in Ireland. However, it is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy Notwithstanding the lack of scientific evidence linking it to BSE or CJD in humans its profile has increased among consumers in recent times.</P>
      <P>Against a background of a level of consumer concern about TSEs generally, and in order to maintain the high reputation of Irish sheepmeat, I have decided to restrict and depopulate flocks which have had a case of scrapie since 1 January 1999. These flocks will not be permitted to repopulate for a period of two years after depopulation. Other flocks which have a history of scrapie are being examined and may also be slaughtered out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following restriction of the flocks in question my Department was asked by the IFA to enter into discussions on the details of a compensation package on the basis that the IFA represented the flockowners in question. The approach maintained by my Department throughout such discussions has been to facilitate early depopulation of the flocks in question by offering a package which encompasses compensation for the market <Col N="240" /> value of each depopulated flock and for loss of profit over subsequent years. This package also addresses a number of other concerns expressed by the flockowners through the IFA. As a State aid it will also be necessary that such a package be cleared by the EU Commission, in which regard the question of whether the compensation envisaged is objectively reasonable will be of key importance. Discussions with the IFA on the compensation package concluded on 21 November and the precise details of the package were confirmed to the IFA in a letter dated 27 November. It was understood that the content of this letter was to be promulgated among all of the flockowners in question by the IFA. It is a matter for each flockowner to decide whether he or she wishes to accept the Department's offer.</P>
    <P>The Department is conscious of the pressures on the flockowners in question given that their flocks have been restricted for some time. Even before the recent round of discussions on all elements of a compensation package got under way, and in response to an approach by the IFA on behalf of certain named flockowners, the Department offered to arrange for the urgent depopulation of these lambs at rates proposed by and subsequently agreed with the IFA. Surprisingly, none of the particular flockowners concerned has to date availed of this offer.</P>
    <P>As for the individual referred to in the Deputy's question, in the event that he is not aware of the offer made to IFA I am arranging for him to be contacted with details of the compensation package on offer.</P>

      <P>I met a deputation from Wexford County Council in February 2001 to discuss matters arising from the serious flooding which occurred in various locations in County Wexford, including Enniscorthy, in November 2000. Arising from that meeting a steering group was set up comprising officials from Wexford County Council, Enniscorthy Urban District Council and the Office of Public Works to progress the investigation of the flooding problem in Enniscorthy. Owing to restrictions relating to foot and mouth disease, however, there was some unavoidable delay in progressing the matter immediately. In May 2001 the Office of Public Works forwarded to Wexford County Council, for circulation to the steering committee, a draft brief for the engagement of consultants for the proposed study of the Enniscorthy flooding problem. The steering committee met to consider the brief and is due to meet again on 11 December 2001 when it is hoped to finalise the brief. Following this, the tender competition for consultants must be advertised in the EU journal. The appointment of a consultant will be subject to the availability of funding at the relevant time.</P>

      <P>The disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme is currently under review by an interdepartmental group which is chaired by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The group is examining all aspects of the scheme including the qualifying medical criteria. I understand the work of the review group is at an advanced stage. I have been informed that there are up to 360,000 persons in Ireland who could be regarded as disabled to some degree or other. I do not consider it prudent to make any further comment at this time.</P>

      <Quest>if, in respect of section 598 of the Tax Consolidation Act, 1997, he will confirm that qualifying assets are defined as assets but not shares or investments used in the trade, profession or employments carried on by the individual and the individual's family company; if he will provide an example of the assets which may be included in the Act; if it includes land and buildings owned by the individual but used solely in the trade carried on by the person's family company; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the interpretation by the Revenue Commissioners of the relief involved has effectively stymied the transfer of numerous family businesses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>This question is similar to those raised by Deputy Kenny in Questions Nos. 59 and 60 to which I replied on Thursday, 8 November 2001. In my reply I set out how the relief afforded by sections 598 and 599 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, operated and I explained what type of assets were covered &ndash; and not covered &ndash; by the relevant provisions in determining capital gains tax retirement relief.</P>
      <P>Moreover, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their interpretation of the issue raised in the question has been consistent since the sections were introduced in their original form in the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975. Their interpretation is that assets held outside a family company are considered &ldquo;investments&rdquo; and are not, therefore, qualifying assets for the purposes of the relief. To the best of their knowledge, this interpretation has never been challenged through the normal appeal mechanism provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware that the &ldquo;transfer of numerous <Col N="244" /> family businesses&rdquo; has been, thereby, &ldquo;effectively stymied&rdquo;. The Deputy will be aware that in my budget in December 1997 I halved the rate of capital gains tax from 40% to 20%, a move that has considerably eased the tax burden where it arises on transfer of property.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a completed inheritance tax return has been submitted by the solicitor acting for the beneficiary, in which liability has been assessed in an amount of £20,086.20. The commissioners have no power to mitigate the amount due. In the circumstances of this case the commissioners are willing to accept payment of the outstanding liability under an instalment arrangement. Normally, these payments would attract interest, but because of the circumstances of this case, they are concessionally prepared to accept payment of any instalment without interest accruing. Alternatively, the commissioners are prepared to postpone collection of the unpaid tax, if the taxpayer is agreeable to the registration of a charge on the property inherited, in favour of Revenue, equal to the outstanding liability. Normally, interest would accrue on such a charge. However, if this option is availed of by the taxpayer, then it is proposed to waive the interest requirement.</P>

      <P>The rate of VAT on the construction of a new house is currently 12.5%. Under the EU sixth VAT directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply, goods and services which were zero rated on 1 January 1991 can continue to be zero rated. However, the directive prohibits the introduction of new zero rates. Since a zero rate did not apply to construction on 1 January 1991, it is not within my power to relieve the VAT liable on the construction of a new house, irrespective of the status of the applicant.

The findings of the report, together with the first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry, have informed my Department's policy on the provision and further development of services for attention deficit disorder-attention deficit hyperactivity disorder &ndash; ADD-ADHD. In this regard, additional funding of approximately £4.7 million, 6 million is being made available in 2002 for child and adolescent psychiatric services. This funding will enhance existing consultant-led teams and provide for a number of additional consultant-led teams throughout the country. A copy of the report will be sent to the ADD-ADHD support groups shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy's questions both refer to youth homelessness. Since 1997 and this year this Government has invested an additional £92 million &ndash; 116.82 million &ndash; revenue in child welfare and protection services. This has provided for a wide range of developments including alternative care services and family support and preventive services. The Government's commitment to tackling the problems of social exclusion in this area was underlined by the launch of the National Children's Strategy at the end of last year and the passing of the Children Act, 2001.</P>
      <P>In January 1998, the Government established the young people at risk programme, the centre piece of which is the young people's facilities and services fund. An allocation of £7.2 million &ndash; 9.14 million &ndash; was made from this fund to launch the Springboard Initiative under which originally 14 projects were established with a further three developed in 2001. The objective of these projects is to assist children and young people to remain at home, out of trouble and in school by providing a proactive, inter-agency response to support these young people and their families. The projects provide for the establishment of formal collaborative structures involving relevant public agencies, the voluntary sector and the local community and the identification or establishment of a local centre which will act as a focal point for the delivery of services to children, young people and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recently published national health strategy proposes a number of actions to expand family support services. These include the refocusing of child welfare budgets over the next seven years to provide a more even balance between safeguarding activities and supportive programmes and the further development of Springboard projects and other family support initiatives. The Government has shown significant commitment to tackling youth homelessness. It has done this by targeting resources at the youth homeless service in the context of the development of the <Col N="251" /> broader child welfare services. The main difficulty in regard to youth homelessness has been in the Dublin area and £6.6 million &ndash; 8.38 million &ndash; has been made available to date to the eastern region to address this problem.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive package of child care service developments was agreed in 2000 to tackle youth homelessness and some of the key provisions of the package are as follows: a director of homelessness was appointed in 2000 and each of the three area health boards have appointed an additional assistant chief executive to allow for the enhanced provision of child care and youth homelessness services; outreach services are being expanded and restructured to ensure vulnerable young children are aware of all the new facilities and can avail of them; a provider forum which brings together the key statutory and voluntary service providers in the youth homelessness field has been established; each of the three area boards has carried out a review of existing facilities, and properties have been sourced to provide additional hostel-residential care accommodation. Taking account of emergency, short-term, downstream and mainstream child care residential facilities between 60 and 70, approximately, extra places have been provided; multidisciplinary teams are being developed to target young people at risk and-or out of home. Family resource centres, specialist services for children with addiction problems are being put in place.</P>
    <P>Services for homeless children are also provided by the other health boards and generally these are provided as part of the child protection and welfare services. Emergency and other facilities have been developed in Cork, Limerick, Galway and other centres to cater for youth homelessness. Additional funding has been allocated to support these services.</P>
    <P>On 31 October I published the youth homelessness strategy which complements the Government's strategy on adult and family homelessness. Homelessness &ndash; An Integrated Strategy, published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The strategy provides a strategic framework for youth homelessness to be tackled on a national basis. The goal of the strategy is &ldquo;to reduce and if possible eliminate youth homelessness through preventative strategies and where a child becomes homeless to ensure that he-she benefits from a comprehensive range of services aimed at reintegrating him-her into his-her community as quickly as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Each health board is currently in the process of drawing up a two year youth homelessness implementation plan following consultation with relevant statutory and voluntary providers in line with specific actions required under 12 objectives in three broad categories: preventive measures, responsive services and planning and administrative supports. The three area boards in the eastern region will develop a joint regional implementation plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> The strategy also requires that a range of other bodies in the public sector, including schools, the National Education Welfare Board, local authorities, the city and county development boards to either support the actions of health boards or take specific steps themselves.</P>
    <P>At national level, given the cross sectoral dimensions of youth homelessness, the National Children's Office will have lead responsibility for driving and co-ordinating the actions necessary to ensure the successful implementation of the strategy. The types of service needed to respond to youth homelessness including those referred to by the Deputy will be examined in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since mid-1997 over £92 million, 116.82 million, additional revenue funding has been invested through the health boards in the development of the child welfare protection and family support services.</P>
      <P>Capital investment of approximately £30 million &ndash; 38.09 million &ndash; is being made available by this Government through the health boards to put in place additional high support and special care places to provide for a small group of children who need more intensive intervention. The number of high support and special care places has increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of 88. Included in this figure is the 24 place purpose built special care unit at Ballydowd in the eastern region which is being opened on a phased basis and the seven place special care unit for girls in Cork.</P>
      <P>An additional 46 places are planned as follows: in the eastern region a high support facility providing 24 places at Portrane is nearing completion; the Midland Health Board, North-Eastern Health Board, North-Western Health Board and the Western Health Board are co-operating to provide 12 high support places on a single campus in Castleblayney; the Mid-Western Health Board will be providing an additional five high support places and five special care places for adolescent boys. Places in these facilities are due to become available by mid-2002.</P>
      <P>While health boards have experienced some difficulties in recruiting suitably trained staff progress has been made in this area through recruitment abroad and the expansion of training courses. As the Deputy will be aware a new career and pay structure for child care workers was introduced earlier this year. This aims to ensure that more people are attracted into child care and to ensure that child care workers are trained to an appropriate level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recruitment and retention of staff for high sup<Col N="253" /> port and special care units is also being looked at by the special residential services board which will advise and improve the co-ordination of special residential services for children convicted by the courts and for non-offending children in need of special care and protection.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>the actions he proposes to take to provide proper recognition of the role of homeopathic medicine; and his proposals in relation to the recognition of qualifications and the extension of proper cover for medical card holders for such treatments.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a system of registration established in this country with regard to homeopathic medicinal products. Companies seeking to market such products should make application to the Irish Medicines Board for appropriate registration. In order for homeopathic medicinal products to be included in the common list of items reimbursable under the community drug schemes, the products must comply with a list of criteria. These range from the uses for and licensing of medicines to the pricing of products. The product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. In addition the product should be an allopathic medicinal product and subject to a product authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board. Homeopathic products do not meet these criteria and, accordingly, are not eligible for inclusion on the common list.</P>
      <P>As a preliminary step in the process of developing a system of registration for complementary and alternative therapists which could include homeopathic practitioners, I established a forum which met in June 2001 to examine and explore practical issues involved including education and training. As detailed in the health strategy there is a number of factors which any registration system should take account as follows: the categories of therapists to be covered; the evidence base for each therapy; the educational qualifications, training and experience of therapists; the scope of practice involved; the protection of the public and promotion of a quality service, including the efficacy of the therapies offered; regulations governing alternative therapists in other countries; and the current proposals for statutory registration of health and social care professionals in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Arising from the work of the forum I have requested the Institute of Public Administration to prepare a report on proposals for the way forward taking into consideration the formal views of the representative groups that participated in the forum. It is intended to publish this report by March 2002 next.</P>

      <P>Since May 2000 communicable disease screening is offered on a voluntary basis to asylum seekers as part of the initial reception process during their stay at reception centres in Dublin. This service is offered in the interests of the asylum seekers themselves, their families and the community generally. Health boards outside the ERHA area were requested to ensure that screening is offered to asylum seekers accommodated in their area and who have not availed of screening during their stay in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach adopted in relation to communicable disease screening for asylum seekers was reviewed recently by the national advisory committee in relation to public health aspects of screening for asylum seekers and amended guidelines were prepared and issued in September 2001. These guidelines recommend that screening be offered for tuberculosis, hepatitis B, polio and varicella zoster &ndash; chickenpox. The guidelines do <Col N="255" /> not preclude other investigations deemed necessary on clinical or public health grounds.</P>
    <P>With regard to immunisation, the guidelines recommend that the immunisation status of asylum seekers should be determined and that where indicated, vaccination against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme should be provided. Figures provided by the Northern Area Health Board, on behalf of the ERHA, indicate that the number of asylum seekers screened at reception centres in the last five years is as follows.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £90-114.28 &ndash; £120-152.39 &ndash; £150-190.46 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention. The new rates represent a 25% increase and were introduced on 1 April last.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>In relation to the particular case raised by the Deputy, as the provision of health services in the Cork area is a matter for the Southern Health Board, I have asked the chief executive officer of the board to investigate the case and respond to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The Irish Medicines Board &ndash; IMB &ndash; routinely monitors the safety of all medicinal products through review and evaluation of suspected adverse drug reaction &ndash; ADR &ndash; reports notified in association with their use. These reports together with additional information from other sources &ndash; foreign reports, literature publications, study reports etc. &ndash; provide a basis for any regulatory action deemed necessary to allow a medicinal product to continue to be used, with an acceptable margin of safety, in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As well as these routine methods to review the safety profile of the drug concerned and identify any emerging safety issues associated with its use, the human medicines advisory committee &ndash; HMAC &ndash; of the IMB recommended that a post-marketing surveillance, PMS, programme for the drug concerned should be undertaken in Ireland. This PMS programme was initiated in August 1999 and is ongoing. Information collated in respect of 378 patients treated with the drug concerned has not given rise to any new safety concerns or impacted on the IMB's previous assessment of the risk of development of symptoms of depression as currently set out in the product information.</P>

      <P>To date, the Irish Medicines Board &ndash; IMB &ndash; has not received any reports of fatalities suspected in association with use of the anti-malarial medicine referred to by the Deputy. The IMB is however, aware of recent newspaper reports referring to a fatality in a 27 year old Irish man following treatment with the drug concerned. As details of this case have not as yet been provided to the IMB by the coroner, it is not possible to comment further on this specific case at this stage.</P>

    <P>Discussions regarding the new taxi licensing regime have taken place between my Department and a range of taxi and other interests on a number of occasions since 21 November 2000 when the new regulatory regime was introduced.

My Department <Col N="260" /> remains available for further meetings, as necessary.</P>
    <P>Public service vehicle regulations have been amended to address a number of the issues raised in these discussions. Mitigation measures were introduced in the Finance Act, 2001, and a scheme of taxi licence fee refunds by certain local authorities was also put in place early in 2001.</P>
    <P>I have made clear that I am committed to the development of further quality improvements for taxi services for the benefit of both the general public and service providers alike in the medium term and, in that context, I will shortly finalise a consultation document. There has also been detailed consultation between my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to aspects of the proposed disabilities Bill which are of relevance to the provision of taxi services for disabled persons.</P>

      <P>Under section 59 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, and without prejudice to the right of the Environmental Protection Agency to perform the functions conferred on it under the Act, each local authority is generally responsible for the supervision and enforcement of the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the holding, recovery or disposal of waste within its functional area. I have no direct function in this regard. Accordingly, it is a matter in the first instance for local authorities to address the incidence of unauthorised waste disposal activities, using the very significant powers and remedies which are available under the 1996 Act.

      <P>The Waste Management Act, 1996, places a general duty on holders of waste not to hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes, or is likely to cause, environmental pollution. It is a matter for waste holders to make appropriate arrangements for the recovery or disposal of waste. Arrangements for the disposal of clinical waste, including healthcare risk waste, are a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Under current procedures, healthcare risk waste should be carefully segregated from other wastes within each hospital. Detailed guidance on the segregation and packaging of healthcare risk waste has been in circulation to all appropriate public hospitals for some time. Non-hazardous wastes may be disposed of using commercial waste contractors.</P>
      <P>Under joint arrangements agreed by the Department of Health and Children here and the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland, a single contract for the management of healthcare risk waste, other than radioactive waste, is in place in both jurisdictions. The contracted company collects segregated healthcare risk waste from publicly funded hospitals, sterilises it, carries out an element of materials recovery and recycling, and landfills the sterilised residue. It is understood that private hospitals also avail of this service.</P>
      <P>The company concerned is required to operate its collection and treatment service to the highest environmental and health and safety standards. Its facilities are licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors compliance with licence conditions.</P>
      <P>I have no function in relation to the management of radioactive hospital wastes. The Waste Management Act, 1996, does not apply to radioactive substances. However, I understand that all hospitals in Ireland have to comply with the requirements of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, for the provision of licences for the use and disposal of radioactive materials. The exercise of controls in this regard is a matter for the RPII.</P>

      <P>Local authority housing output, including both new build and acquisitions, is expected to reach some 5,000 units this year. This level of output is underpinned by an increased level of work in progress which should lead on to an estimated 6,000 completions-acquisitions in 2002. All of these completions will impact on the numbers on the local authority waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme together with the increased output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of approximately 11,000 households be met this year and more than 13,000 households in 2002. The total number of households to be provided with accommodation under the various social housing programmes this year &ndash; 11,000 &ndash; would represent between 20% and 25% of the total numbers on the waiting lists. In addition, of course, to those being housed from the waiting list there is also a flow of new applications onto the waiting lists. An accurate estimate of the position in relation to waiting lists will be established by the next statutory assessment of housing needs which is due to be undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 2002.</P>
      <P>Local authorities do not generally maintain waiting lists for houses being sold under the affordable housing scheme. Houses are advertised in the local press as they become available and invitations to purchase are invited. Local authorities prioritise these applications taking account of household circumstances, housing need and ability to repay the net price involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>Fire and emergency services are provided primarily by the local authorities acting, as appropriate, in conjunction with the other emergency services locally. My Department supports these services through a range of functions, including sponsoring the legislation underpinning the fire service, funding &ndash; which I have substantially increased during my term of office &ndash; the development and updating of an emergency planning framework and guidelines and the promotion of training and other initiatives. I am satisfied that the fire and emergency services stand prepared and capable of providing an adequate and effective response to emergencies.</P>
      <P>However, in pursuing my Department's role of oversight of fire and emergency services, earlier this year I initiated a major review of fire safety and fire services in Ireland. The final report of the consultants engaged to assist in the review is expected very shortly and it will help inform the development of policy for the future direction of the local authority fire and emergency services.</P>
      <P>In relation to planning for emergencies, in the light of recent international events, my Department has asked local authorities to review their major emergency plans and local plans to ensure that they were up to date and effective. In addition, the Government task force on emergency planning meets on a regular basis to ensure that preparations are in place for a co-ordinated response to possible nuclear, chemical or biological threats. The task force monitors the current security assessment of threats and ensures that plans are in place for emergency services response to any threats arising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan provides for expenditure of almost 4.4 billion over the period 2000-06 on water services infrastructure, the bulk of which will be incurred on the treatment of wastewater. This is approximately three times the total comparable spend during the 1994-99 period and will see spending in 2001 reach more than twice the 1998 level. Exchequer expenditure this year is expected to reach a record 500 million.</P>
      <P>The wastewater schemes included in the water services investment programme, 2000-02, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, were drawn mainly from the assessments of needs produced by local authorities in response to my Department's request to all authorities to prepare and submit prioritised proposals for dealing with their capital water and wastewater requirements. The assessments have helped to quantify the amount of investment needed to augment existing schemes and to provide new facilities.</P>
      <P>Funding for wastewater infrastructure under the water services investment programme is focused on meeting the requirements of the urban wastewater treatment directive. A number of significant wastewater schemes have already been substantially completed under the new programme in locations such as Drogheda, Dundalk, Leixlip, Oberstown and Loughrea. The provision of the necessary facilities is well advanced in locations such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway. The NDP provides for an investment of 1.7 billion to complete the remaining wastewater schemes required under the directive.</P>
      <P>The current investment strategy, covering the period 2000-02, is the first phase of a rolling three year programme that will be advanced progressively up to the end of the NDP in 2006. Additional schemes will be added to the programme in future phases on the basis of prevailing priority needs at the time.</P>

      <P>There is a general requirement under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts not to cause or permit any polluting matter to enter waters, and all sewage treatment systems for single houses must be designed so as to respect this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of efficiency achieved by different wastewater treatment systems for single houses will vary from case to case depending on the system installed, site and soil conditions, the level of treatment provided and the quality of management and maintenance. It is not practicable to <Col N="265" /> specify effluent standards for traditional septic tank systems as is done for municipal wastewater treatment installations. Accordingly, direct comparison is not possible between the environmental performance of the respective systems.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has published a series of wastewater treatment manuals setting out guidance on the management, maintenance, supervision, operation and use of wastewater systems in different situations. An EPA manual on treatment systems for single houses has recently been published and is available in the Oireachtas Library. This contains a range of recommendations designed to assist local authorities, system designers and householders to optimise wastewater treatment and to minimise environmental risk from effluent deriving from single houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the negative impact that heavy goods vehicles can have, particularly in urban areas. For example, the Road Accidents Facts 2000 report, which has been published by the National Roads Authority, and a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library, shows that 74 of the total of 415 road accident fatalities occurring in that year involved goods vehicles.</P>
      <P>Some 90% of freight in Ireland is carried by road. A balanced approach must be adopted, therefore, that takes into account environmental, health and safety issues while at the same time facilitating the movement of goods. Measures are included in the national development plan which will, on completion, significantly improve the traffic situation in both urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>The NDP includes an amount of £4.7 billion &ndash; 1999 prices &ndash; for the improvement and maintenance of the national road network in the period 2000-06. This is a threefold increase in the level of investment in national roads provided for in 1994-99. This funding will ensure development by 2006 of the major inter-urban routes to motorway-high quality dual carriageway standard, further major improvements on other national primary routes and improvement of national secondary roads, with emphasis on routes which are of particular importance to economic and regional development, including links to the strategic corridors, roads serving key ports, airports, tourists areas, industry and multi-purpose roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This upgrading of the road network will involve the bypassing of, and the removal of through-<Col N="266" /> traffic from, many towns and villages. The National Roads Authority is now progressing with the implementation of the national roads development programme as set out in the NDP. Under the Roads Act, 1993, the NRA has overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads. My Department provides an annual block grant for the NRA for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In the case of Dublin, the Dublin port tunnel, when it is completed in 2004, will very significantly reduce the number of heavy goods vehicles using the city centre. A regional freight study is to be undertaken by the Dublin Transportation Office as part of its integrated transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area to 2016. This study will identify appropriate routes and identify measures for the better management of general goods distribution for freight trips to and from Dublin Port, Dún Laoghaire Port and Dublin Airport.</P>

      <P>The national development plan provides for an investment of approximately £24 billion &ndash; 30 billion &ndash; at current prices in the development of economic and social infrastructure over the period 2000 to 2006. Of the total planned investment, approximately £19 billion &ndash; 24 billion &ndash; is for infrastructure programmes coming within the remit of my Department, including national and non-national roads, water and waste water, housing, waste management and urban and village development. Satisfactory progress is being made by local authorities and the National Roads Authority on the implementation of these programmes. Expenditure on these programmes in 2000 amounted to £1.75 billion &ndash; 2.222 billion &ndash; which was in line with NDP targets. Good progress has been maintained in 2001; provisional figures indicate that combined expenditure to the end of September 2001 on national roads, housing and water services amounted to £1.237 billion &ndash; 1.571 billion &ndash; or 62% of projected expenditure for 2001 as a whole. A Supplementary Estimate, will benefit the following services: national roads will get an additional £95 million &ndash; 121 million &ndash; and water services will get an additional £63 million &ndash; 80 million.</P>
      <P>The abridged Estimates for my Department for 2002, published on 15 November, together with the additional allocations announced in the budget, provide for an increase of over 18% in 2002 in spending by my Department over the 2001 revised Estimates provision. Taking account of the already unprecedented volume of investment in NDP infrastructure programmes this level of funding will ensure a continuation of activity at a high level under these programmes. This continuing high level of capital investment reflects the Government's commitment to the implementation of the NDP, in particular the infrastructure elements of the plan that are crucial to future competitiveness and social progress.</P>

The report arising from the investigation reflects the outcome of four individual investigations: on animal health by the veterinary laboratory services of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development; on soil, herbage, feed and water by Teagasc; on human health by the Mid-Western Health Board; and on environmental quality by the EPA. Issues in relation to the individual elements of the overall investigation are matters for the organisations <Col N="269" /> concerned.

      <P>Stringent standards in relation to the quality of drinking water are prescribed by the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988. Standards are prescribed in relation to 55 separate parameters. The regulations impose a duty on sanitary authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure that supplies of drinking water generally meet those standards save in emergency situations or other exceptional situations specified in the regulations, including situations where a departure is granted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. A departure from the prescribed standards may be granted to take account of special circumstances arising from the nature and structure of the ground in the area from which the water supply emanates and of circumstances arising from exceptional weather conditions. A departure which would constitute a public health hazard may not be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information in relation to the departures granted to Limerick County Council, Sligo County Council and Sligo Corporation is set out in the following table. The departures are granted subject to the conditions that the sanitary authority shall continue to monitor the parameters involved, and take all possible measures to keep exceedances for the parameters at the lowest possible level. The departures relate to the parameters colour, iron and manganese and are valid until 31 December 2003. The granting of departures in relation to these parameters will not arise subsequent to that date because of the commencement on 1 January 2004 of the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations, 2000 and the consequent repeal of the 1988 regulations. The new regulations classify the parameters colour, iron and manganese, and 17 other parameters, as &lsquo;indicator parameters' and will permit a more flexible regime in relation to parameters. The new regulations will also transfer the function of granting departures, to the Environmental Protection Agency in so far as these are required under the new regime.<Col N="270" /></P>

      <P>As stated in reply to Question No. 236 of 27 November, the Local Government Act, 2001, will confer a statutory right of public attendance at meetings of the full council. However, the Act requires local authorities to adopt new standing orders in order to give full effect to the new provisions dealing generally with local authority meetings and proceedings. It is not realistic that local authorities would have new standing orders drafted, presented to their elected councils for consideration and passed by the councils by January 2002, and for this reason the new provisions have been scheduled to come into operation in April 2002.</P>
      <P>While there is currently no explicit statutory right of access to local authority meetings for the public at present, in practice the public generally have access to meetings of local authorities and various arrangements are in place locally to facilitate their attendance. Pending mobilisation of the procedures under the 2001 Act I would encourage local authorities to continue to provide reasonable access to meetings by the public.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. While my Department has responsibility in relation to the formulation of the policy under which the SWA scheme operates, the day to day administration of the scheme, which includes deciding entitlement to SWA and the authorisation of payments in the case of successful applicants, is a matter for the health boards. There is no provision for my Department to pay interim payments of rent or mortgage interest supplements to people pending a decision on a claim.</P>
      <P>While administrative difficulties leading to occasional delays can arise in local districts from time to time for a variety of reasons, in general there should be no delay in making such payments by health boards. The conditions for receiving rent and mortgage interest supplement, and the associated administrative arrangements, will be examined as part of the review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is currently being undertaken as part of my Department's series of formal programme evaluations. Any changes that are needed will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for this matter lies with my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, but it was not possible to transfer the question to his Department in time. I have, however, been supplied with the following material for reply by my colleague the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The administration of the registration system, including the registration of deaths, is a matter for An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir &ndash; the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages &ndash; and for local registrars who operate under his general direction. The details to be registered in relation to a death are set out in section 30 of the Births and Deaths Registration (Ireland) Act, 1863, and the schedule to that Act. These include date and place of death, name and age of the deceased, occupation and cause of death. Certified copies of entries in the register of deaths &ndash; death certificates &ndash; include all details contained in the relevant entry in the register of deaths. I presume the Deputy is referring to the inclusion of the cause of death on these certificates.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs have been engaged in the review of the entire registration system. The review is examining registration law and the structure of registration on a national basis in order to identify the changes needed to capitalise on the use of modern computer technology to capture registration information in an electronic format at the point of registration. The objective is to implement a modern, efficient, effective and customer focused service geared to the needs of the 21st century. The modernisation of the registration service will improve the efficiency, flexibility, access and management of the records and the associated indexes. The modernisation project has received submissions from a number of parties following the launch of its consultation document last May covering a range of issues and this consultation process is continuing. The possible issue of certified extracts from the registers of deaths, as proposed by the Deputy, in relation to events registered from a prospective date is being considered in the context of the modernisation of the civil registration service.</P>

      <P>Section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2001, provides that a presumption of corruption will arise in certain circumstances, including in relation to the exercise of certain functions under the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Commencement of subsection 4(2)(f2&gt;c) is dependent on all the relevant sections of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, also being in operation. However, there are a number of relevant sections of that Act which are not yet in operation. Accordingly, subsection 4(2)(f2&gt;c) cannot be brought into operation at present. It is my intention to make an order bringing subsection 4(2)(f2&gt;c) into operation as soon as all the relevant sections of the Act have been commenced.</P>

As with all proposals for funding provided within the multi-annual budgeting system, continued funding is dependent on a number of factors, including value for money, no policy change in respect of the provision, the organisation's compliance with the relevant public financial procedures governing such grants and the availability of exchequer funding within the overall exigencies of public finances.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment &ndash; CE &ndash; schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million &ndash; 58,407,951 &ndash; per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million &ndash; 40,631,618 &ndash; in this school year. My Department has now issued circulars to all primary schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements. In line with the new arrangements, the school referred to by the Deputy will receive a further payment towards the cost of ancillary services shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million &ndash; 2,539,476 &ndash; to respond to the recommendations of the consultants. The Deputy will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to <Col N="280" /> complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain participants may be entitled to continue working in their schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under the scheme. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
    <P>Schools that used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from special education section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>In order to be eligible for free school transport, pupils at primary level must reside at least two miles from and be attending their nearest suitable national school. Where children are ineligible for free transport they may be allowed concessionary fare paying transport subject to the agreement of the nearest school being secured. It is also subject to spare seats being available after all eligible pupils have been accommodated and to no extra state cost being incurred in facilitating the pupils. An extension to an existing service may only be considered where a pupil has a medical condition which would prevent him-her making their own way to a pick up point and where he-she is attending his-her nearest suitable school.</P>
      <P>The pupil in question resides in a school area other than the school attended and would be eligible for free transport to his appropriate school only. He is currently availing of concessionary fare paying transport to the school of attendance. As the pupil concerned is not attending his nearest suitable school it is not open to my Department to extend the route as requested.</P>

      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students. The action group considered that the target group of 'those most in need' could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of those receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over, subject to specific conditions. The condition relating to means, for all applicants, states that, for the purpose of the current academic year, total reckonable income, in the tax year to 5 April 2001, must not exceed £7,400. In this regard, reckonable income equals gross income less the standard social welfare and health board payments excluded for the ordinary maintenance grant, less, where applicable, social welfare child dependent allowance payments. I will arrange for my Department to forward to the Deputy full details of the eligibility criteria for the special rates of maintenance grant.</P>

      <P>The planning unit of my Department is currently in the process of determining the long-term projected enrolment figure of Coláiste Eamann Ris. This figure will not only identify the size of the sports hall to be provided at the school, but is also required by the school in order to complete an educational worksheet. A senior edu<Col N="285" /> cationalist from my Department will then draw up schedules of accommodation based on this worksheet, at which stage; the extent of the additional accommodation to be provided will become clear. It is not possible, therefore, to estimate the cost of any future works at this early stage.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the child referred to by the Deputy. Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national educational psychological service, NEPS, is available to all post primary schools recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise <Col N="286" /> on the management of any difficulties that pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate, it can also advise on any educational supports that might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible. In order to progress this case further a questionnaire has issued to the child's mother which will help identify his educational needs and provide my Department with her written permission to contact schools and NEPS on behalf of her child.</P>
    <P>My Department allocates concessionary teaching hours to second level schools to cater for the needs of special needs pupils enrolled therein. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each case is considered on its merits and determined on the advice of the psychological service. The authorities of the school referred to by the Deputy applied for additional teaching resources to cater for a number of pupils with identified special needs. My Department has recently approved one wholetime teacher equivalent to cater for the educational needs of these pupils needs, including the pupil referred by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort. Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated, while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the rules for national schools, no pupil can be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for <Col N="289" /> the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school. In addition, my Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases. Typically, this can arise where a pupil has been excluded as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made. In these circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with the schools and through the Inspectorate to assist in the re-instatement of the pupil in the school, or alternatively, his-her placement in another school. In more difficult situations the National Educational Psychological Service is available to assess pupils in order to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner.</P>
    <P>I have brought forward a comprehensive range of legislative measures in the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, to address generally issues related to school attendance and discipline in schools. The legislation provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board with responsibility for monitoring school attendance on a countrywide basis. The board will employ educational welfare officers, who will be deployed locally to assist all recognised primary and second-level schools. The Act will require schools to report suspensions that last at least six days to their local educational welfare officer. The automatic involvement of the educational welfare officer in these situations will provide a key means for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of school. Under section 15(2)(f2&gt;d) of the Education Act, 1998, a board of management of a school, with the agreement of the patron, shall publish and provide the policy of the school concerning expulsion of students, subject to the proviso that this decision may be appealed to the secretary general of my Department under section 29(1)(f2&gt;a) of the Act.</P>

      <P>My Department has received an application for a building project at Aghina national school, County Cork. The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The <Col N="290" /> allocation in the current year is £370.5 million &ndash; 470.4 million. This is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding has enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects, and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day.</P>
      <P>Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including a building project at Aghina national school, which is in the late stages of architectural planning, will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes and when all budget decisions have been taken by the Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 195 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compensation as provided for in the Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001, is through an <i>ex gratia</i> scheme. The position in law is that this scheme involves no finding of fault and no declaration of liability. The scheme is designed to address the fact that the institutions concerned, <Col N="291" /> in many ways, departed from the normal requirements of child care. It acknowledges that because of this many people who were in institutional care have, through much of their lives, carried serious psychological scars. The scheme seeks to provide reasonable financial compensation for that injury.</P>
    <P>It is not the case that awards will be made without validation or on the basis of untested evidence. As the Bill currently stands a claimant to the redress board must first establish that he or she was a resident in an institution covered by the Bill, that he or she is suffering or has suffered some significant injury, physical or psychological and that the injury is consistent with the abuse as alleged. This will involve significant medical and psychiatric evidence. The claimant may present his or her own medical evidence and the board may have assessments carried out on its behalf. Enough is known of the conditions of deprivation and extreme corporal punishment in some of the institutions in the past to accept without deep inquiry the link between current or past injury and residence in the institution. Section 22 of the Bill as currently worded prohibits any person from revealing any information provided for the board. This section will ensure that all matters dealt with by the board will remain confidential. Discussions with all interested parties regarding these and other aspects of the Bill are ongoing and I am prepared to consider these issues again during Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>There are no plans at present to examine the validation process of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. The commission, which was established by an Act of the Oireachtas, is independent in the exercise of its functions. As regards validation and the protection of rights of all participants the commission will apply procedures which are akin to those applying in the High Court. These will ensure fair procedures and protection of constitutional rights for every witness. The commission comprises a confidential committee and an investigative committee. The role of the confidential committee is to listen to a person's experiences of abuse in institutions in total confidence. This committee will not inform anyone, or any institution, that a person has made an allegation against them and will not name anyone in any report. The commission's investigative committee will fully investigate complaints and allegations made to it. Persons, or institutions, accused have the right to get advance notice of <Col N="292" /> what a complainant has to say, and to question the complainant if they wish to do so. Legal representation is allowed for both sides. At the conclusion of its work, the commission will report to the public.</P>

      <P>An application by the school authorities of Patrician Academy, Mallow, for grant aid to develop facilities at the school has been received in the planning and building unit of my Department. The initial examination of the application has been completed in the planning section. As part of this process, all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends in the area, have been taken into consideration. A long-term enrolment projection has recently been forwarded to the school authorities for their views. As soon as a projection figure is agreed, a decision will be made on how best to provide for the accommodation requirements of the school. A decision regarding the appointment of a design team for any proposed building project at the Patrician Academy will be taken in the light of available finances and other competing priorities.</P>

      <P>The school authorities are seeking retrospective grant aid toward the cost of roof repairs carried out in the existing accommodation. The matter of funding is currently under consideration. I understand that no formal application has been received from the school authorities in respect of sewerage works. The project for the provision of a new school for the Convent of Mercy secondary school, Mallow, County Cork is currently at stage five &ndash; bill of quantities. The question of authorising the project to proceed to stage six &ndash; tender action and report &ndash; is currently being considered and a decision will be conveyed to the school authorities as soon as possible. In the meantime my Department's building branch will be in touch with the school authorities shortly regarding these remedial works.</P>
