      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met Ambassador Richard Haass, President Bush's envoy on Northern Ireland, in the State Department on Tuesday, 11 September. I subsequently wrote to President Bush, offering him and the people of the United States the deep condolences of the Irish people on the terrible events of 11 September.</P>
      <P>By our collective observance of the National Day of Mourning, the people of Ireland eloquently expressed our deep sense of sorrow and outrage at the terrible events, and Dáil Éireann, at the specially convened sitting of 18 September, expressed its solidarity with the President, Congress and the people of the United States at this difficult time. Naturally, since 11 September, the Government has been keeping in close contact with the US Administration, particularly in the context of our Chairmanship of the UN Security Council. The Government is also, of course, in touch with the US Administration on an ongoing basis with regard to matters relating to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I expect to visit the United States in early November. My programme for this visit, including any possible meeting with President Bush, has not yet been finalised. However, I expect to fulfil a range of engagements in Boston, New York and Washington.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach made contact with the American Administration about the massive financial subsidy being made available to Continental Airlines and Delta Airlines, who are in direct competition with Aer Lingus on the North Atlantic route?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have had no discussions with the US Administration, but the Minister for Public Enterprise is well aware of what has happened. She and her officials have found out precisely how that agreement was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has there been any contact from the American Administration with a view to renegotiating the bilateral air agreement between Ireland and the United States, which is erroneously called the Shannon stopover? Has that been raised by the Americans with any member of the Government or at any level of the Administration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach speaks about these issues when he is in contact with other Governments. It is not the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who would raise these issues with the American Administration. It would either be done through the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Taoiseach's office. The Taoiseach is answering questions in the House and my supplementary questions are within the remit of those questions. The Taoiseach is willing to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Government, through its chairmanship of the Security Council, raised with either the British or the American Governments the ongoing bombardment of Afghanistan? Has the Government supported the concerns expressed by others, among them the Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, that the bombing should cease to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered properly to that beleaguered country? Is the Government concerned in any of the contacts it may or may not have had, either through the Security Council or directly, at what now appears to be a war against the people of Afghanistan, in view of the ongoing bombing, rather than an attempt to capture Osama bin Laden?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All matters relating to the Security Council are, although I am familiar with them, being dealt with by the Minister for</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We still have collective responsibility. Outside this House the Taoiseach will happily take responsibility for answering questions about anything, including commenting on sports matches in another jurisdiction. Surely it is not too much to ask that he might answer the odd question here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I wait for a reply to my question? This and the previous Administration campaigned successfully across the five continents to secure support from more than 100 countries to win a seat on the Security Council. In the month that Ireland chairs the meetings of the Security Council it surely must have crossed the Taoiseach's mind to raise the ongoing war against Afghanistan with the United States Government <Col N="180" /> if the contacts he has had are of concern. What else, if anything, has the Taoiseach raised with the United States Government in the light of what is taking place in the name of the West?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In this month, in particular, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is talking to members of the Security Council and members of the American Administration on a daily basis. He has had several conversations with Colin Powell and other members of the Administration. He is handling those matters. I am aware of a certain amount, but the issues concern not only the Taliban regime and Afghanistan, but also the Sahara, Iraqi sanctions and so forth. Yesterday, I believe, there were discussions on a number of them. They are being dealt with on an hourly basis by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Of course, I am involved, but the Government is, correctly, co-ordinating these matters through the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the hourly contacts the Taoiseach has had in recent days on this issue&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume he is briefing the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach also met with President Arafat last night. If it is not too much of an intrusion, did the Taoiseach express concern about the ongoing bombing in Afghanistan? There are unconfirmed reports, as recently as</P>
      <P>2 p.m. today, that a hospital was bombed in Kabul and five patients were killed. Have these matters been raised by the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not raised these matters because I am not dealing with them. I have made that point clear. However, last week the Minister arranged that all humanitarian issues be dealt with by the Security Council, as the Deputy himself suggested. All relevant NGOs, including the International Red Cross, have been closely involved. Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi is now involved on behalf of Mr. Kofi Annan and the Security Council. An enormous amount of work has been done on the humanitarian issues. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will gladly give detailed answers to these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be anxious to answer questions on this matter. However, in his regular contacts with the Heads of the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom and in continuing to express the sympathy of every Member and party in this House on the atrocities which happened in the United States, will the Taoiseach also articulate the widespread concerns of aid <Col N="181" /> agencies, including Trócaire, and of the former President, Mrs. Mary Robinson, regarding the level of civilian casualties and the 7 million civilians who risk starvation as winter approaches in Afghanistan? Will he bear in mind that humanitarian issue when he next discusses the aftermath of 11 September and take note of the recommendations of Irish aid agencies in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On that issue, Ireland has been to the forefront in using our position as President of the Security Council. Last Monday week, 12 hours after the first bombing, the Minister for Foreign Affairs made sure the humanitarian issue and the concerns of NGOs were raised at the Security Council. The Minister is particularly conscious of the concerns of those aid organisations which have been working in Afghanistan largely unnoticed for a number of years. We gave our largest ever donation of aid last October, when these matters were receiving very little attention on the world stage. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is conscious of these concerns. We have raised this issue at the Security Council and will continue to do so. The Minister has organised meetings with the International Red Cross and with Irish aid organisations to make sure their views are known. We will continue to do that. My answer to the Deputy's question is yes, I will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the lay-offs announced or threatened by US companies in Ireland, would the Taoiseach consider an enhanced role for the IDA in its north American offices, to ensure the number of such job losses is minimised? Will he, in particular, take steps to ensure the present difficulties are not used by US companies to transfer jobs in Ireland to lower cost countries in circumstances where these companies have legally binding agreements for the maintenance of certain employment levels in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are monitoring this matter on a daily basis and dealing with the companies where we think there are risks or difficulties. We have instructed our IDA and Enterprise Ireland people, at home and abroad, to monitor all companies which have a foreign direct investment. Ministers have been involved in meeting a number of those companies which are experiencing difficulties. Most companies which are suffering short-term difficulties are highlighting the issues to us themselves and are outlining the actions they are trying to follow to sustain their positions in the longer term, even when they have difficulties in the short-term.</P>
      <P>There has been talk of some companies moving to lower cost countries but we have not come across any yet. We are conscious of this. It has not arisen yet but we will monitor the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach sought the advice of the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board on this matter and, if not, why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="182" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I met some members of the economic board and some of those close to it when they were here on other business last week. I hope to meet them again next month. Members of the board and their partners in business have been very helpful in ensuring all available information and assistance have been given and that all possible action has taken place, for which I am grateful. The Deputy is as conscious as l am that many decisions have emerged from Washington, New York, Boston and elsewhere. It is helpful that inside information is received as early as possible in order that we can endeavour to deal with issues. Members of the economic advisory board and their associates have been helpful and went to the trouble of coming here last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow a brief final supplementary from the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that appropriate arrangements are in place for the promotion of Irish tourism in the United States during this time of crisis? No word other than &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; is suitable to describe what is happening to the tourism industry. Will the Taoiseach state whether the new all-Ireland tourism body, Tourism Ireland Limited, is up and functioning? There are rumours that the body has a chief executive, board and budget, but no staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very conscious of what needs to be done in the United States as regards tourism, but I do not agree with the Deputy's suggestion that we engage in a marketing campaign just now. Meetings in New York, Washington and other places in the United States are being cancelled. The idea of a huge marketing effort at this time, therefore, is inappropriate. Arrangements are being made for the next tourism season in the normal way, focusing on how to attract American tourists to this country. Indications for next year already suggest that a supreme effort is required. We know what has happened on previous occasions when there have been difficulties in the United States. Other ways of marketing with which the Government can assist have been suggested, but tourist numbers will be down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked about tourists from the United States. He is aware that 6,000 people in that country were recently blown out of their offices. American people are not in the humour to travel to the west of Ireland, or anywhere else, even within the United States. We are trying to engage in a programme that will enable us to pick up on the mood when it changes. The promotion of Connemara in New York at the moment is not exactly a great idea.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> The revulsion of ordinary Irish people was expressed to the American people on many occasions following the atrocities of 11 September. In the light of how events have developed, has the Taoiseach conveyed to the Administration in the United States our revulsion about a further slaughter of innocent people in Afghanistan during the last eight days? Does he plan to do so in the next few days and when he visits the United States? Does he accept that he carries a share of moral responsibility as he quite publicly supported the bombings and offered the use of Irish airports to the United States without a discussion in the Dáil? Does he feel he has a responsibility to raise sharply with the Administration in the United States the gravity of the situation in Afghanistan, apart from the bombings, as a famine is threatened? As the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights warned, the number of deaths could rival Rwandan proportions. Does the Taoiseach accept he has a responsibility to bring these concerns to the attention of the United States Administration rather than blindly following the war plans of Britain and the United States?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend during his visit to raise the issue of the US foreign policy? Will he ask why many people in the Arab world in particular cannot take seriously the moral posturing of the United States or of the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair? They are purporting to seek Osama bin Laden, who is allegedly responsible for the atrocity, when they continue to harbour proven mass murderers such as Augusto Pinochet in the West.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly, the people of Afghanistan are primarily victims of drought, civil war and the policies of the Taliban regime that were in operation prior to 11 September. This is the third year of drought and 3 million people were suffering from famine and 700,000 others were at severe risk because of the policies of the Taliban regime and its lack of care for its own people. An enormous aid programme was already in place, with the United States as the biggest sponsor, to try to assist them. The Irish humanitarian effort has been under way since October 2000 through our NGOs and aid organisations. We will continue to assist and help in whatever way possible.</P>
      <P>Ireland will also use its position on the Security Council in that regard and the Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has asked Ambassador Brahimi to try to help. Some $151 million has been devoted to the humanitarian aid programme. Ireland will continue to highlight the plight of the people through international bodies and later this week at European Union level.</P>

      <P>Regarding Question No. 1, is the Taoiseach aware of a recent Forfás report that indicated that while the US companies in Ireland employ more than 100,000 people, Irish multinationals in the United States employ up to 60,000 people? In light of the massive growth in Irish multinationals, particularly in North America, does the Taoiseach have any plans to restructure the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board to create a synergy in certain areas between the mutual investment in the two economies to try to offset the losses that are about to occur because of the downturn in the communications industry in particular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board, we have endeavoured in recent years to get the best possible people, regardless of whether they were involved in multinationals in the United States or Ireland or in indigenous companies. We and the embassy are always on the look out for people who are prepared to give their time and effort. In many cases, the people concerned give an enormous amount of their time free. We constantly look for people who could broaden the focus. I am not opposed to the Deputy's point and it would be good to find people who could help those balances. The downturn in the ICT area is severe at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have many good contacts with people on the board and others associated with them. I spoke to some of them last week and their view is that we must ride out this period and sustain <Col N="185" /> as much as possible while also considering new opportunities that they have identified. The companies I met have a sense that this is a difficult period but it will improve. They feel they can regain momentum in a relatively short period, although the events of 11 September certainly represent a setback.</P>

      <P>Did the Taoiseach, in his meetings with members of the US Administration, receive representations in regard to actions Ireland might take to assist in the detection and apprehension of those involved in the attacks on the US and the networks supporting them? In the context of biological terrorism, has the Government considered tightening up our postal legislation to ensure Ireland is neither used as a base for nor becomes a victim of biological attacks, notably those involving anthrax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first issue, representations were received at European level. The Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers is meeting today to consider areas of co-operation in regard to terrorism. An enormous amount of work, involving liaison and information sharing about suspect people, has been done in this area in the past month at international level. That work is ongoing. Arrests have been made in this country and Irish intelligence forces have co-operated with their international counterparts. Although I do not believe there is a significant number of people in this country involved in this area, certain people, details of whose identities have been circulated internationally, are under investigation.</P>
      <P>The issue of biological attacks is being examined. The viral laboratory which represents Irish expertise in this area is liaising with the expert group in the Department of Health and Children. Laboratory employees, who have substantial knowledge in this area, are advising on the best course of preventative action and remedial action in the event of an attack.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise that matter with my colleagues. Although I am not aware of the existing penalties in this area, I presume they were not intended to cover biological attacks, although in the mid to late 1970s regulations were introduced to deal with people who sent explosives through the post or used the post for the purpose of bomb hoaxes. However, those regulations were not designed to deal with the devastation which would result from biological attacks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the efforts of the Government, and the unique position Ireland holds as President of the UN Security Council, hours after the bombing commenced last week, we were able to ensure the Security Council not only got a briefing on the action by the UK and the US, but we were also able to look at the humanitarian issues that have existed there for some time, to see what more needed to be done. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been involved in co-ordinating the effort to assist those groups. The level of aid the Government has provided in this case is higher than for any previous humanitarian mission. We have been conscious at all times to do everything we can to prevent hardship and loss of life arising from this. At the same time, we understand the allied action is an act of self-defence under UN charter 51, and is in compliance with UN resolutions 1368 and 1373.</P>
      <P>We hope the military action by the United States and its allies will lead, as quickly as possible, to a situation whereby the people who perpetrated the attacks in New York can be arrested and handed over. That is what would stop the bombing campaign. The Deputy has heard President Bush, as I have, saying that if these people are handed over the situation on the ground will change. It appears that Osama bin Laden has been protected for several years, long before 11 September, by the Taliban regime which has ignored several UN resolutions. That is the dilemma. We would like to see compliance with those resolutions. The Taliban, if not overthrown, should at least comply with what they have been asked to do, which is hand over Osama bin Laden. If the Taliban were interested in their people they would do so but, quite frankly, I do not think they are and that is why three million people have been starving. Some seven million may now be in difficulties. Deputy Quinn's position is a fair one, but we have to remember that the United States has been doing more than anyone else to try to help the unfortunate people who happen to live under the oppressive Taliban regime.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 19, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On 26 July, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and I attended the plenary meeting to monitor implementation of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>All the social partners were represented at the meeting and its purpose was a review of progress and plans under the broad headings of competitiveness, waste management and housing. The Government and the social partners attach special importance to these areas of particular challenge.</P>
      <P>For my part, I emphasised the important role which social partnership can continue to play in bringing about further progress in these and other areas. To that end I made clear the Government's firm commitment to realise the ambitious reform agendas set out, not only in the PPF, but in the national development plan. At the same time I felt it necessary to caution against sectional interests being pursued at the expense of the wider community.</P>
      <P>The next PPF plenary meeting will take place tomorrow. The three main items on the agenda are drugs, the strategic review of FÁS and the likely impact on the Irish economy arising from the changing global situation, especially in the United States. In line with well established practice, a detailed progress report on implementation of the PPF has been produced for the meeting and has been lodged in the Oireachtas Library. This report sets out for each Department, including my own, the progress being made under each action point in the PPF.</P>
      <P>My Department exercises the lead co-ordinating role for overall implementation of the PPF and is responsible for supporting a number of cross-departmental issues, such as public service modernisation. In addition, my Department chairs the national implementation body which was established under the adjusted PPF terms of December last. The body continues to meet as necessary and its purpose is to ensure delivery of the stability and peace provisions of the PPF and to consider, in particular, the potential implications of any ongoing disputes of special national importance.</P>
      <P>As regards meetings, I meet representatives of individual social partner organisations on a regular basis, but I have no plans to meet the social partners collectively in the near future.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to involve the social partners in an attempt to avoid chaos in secondary schools if the ASTI withdraws <Col N="192" /> supervision and school managers are forced to close schools for insurance reasons? Arising from this issue, what progress has been made on benchmarking across the public service, including the teaching profession?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The benchmarking body is working to its remit and going through the analytical work necessary to form the basis of its report next year. That work is proceeding satisfactorily and without interference.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with directly involving the social partners is that one of the teachers' unions is not involved in the social partnership process or any of the committees. From previous difficulties we know it will not play a part in this process. However, the Minister is directly involved in trying to avoid any of the difficulties we experienced previously.</P>

      <P>We are taking many questions together and it will not be possible to raise points on all of them. In his speech to the social partners on 27 July, the Taoiseach referred to the national development plan as a key element in promoting the objectives of social partnership in general and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in particular. In reply to questions in the House, the Taoiseach allowed others to describe him as the effective project manager for the implementation of the national development plan.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach accepts that this is his task as Chairman of the Cabinet sub-committee on the implementation of the national development plan, then no doubt his attention has been drawn to an article in Monday's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i> to the effect that ten major roads projects are between three and six months behind schedule and that groups of engineers who were assembled and brought back to this country to work on these programmes are facing lay-offs and possible return to other countries. This is just one example of a raft of delays to which I could refer. In view of this report, which has not been refuted or challenged by the Government, will the Taoiseach in his capacity as project manager for the national development plan give an explanation to the House as to the reason for these delays? What course of action, if any, will he take to rectify them?</P>

      <P>I am not the project manager. We endeavour to assist the National Roads Authority and all the other bodies in their work. There are some delays, but at the same time there is an enormous amount going on. Some of the delays are due to a failure to come to an agreement with the farming bodies &ndash; this has held up a number of the contracts in a very substantial way. Those negotiations are ongoing. It has taken considerable time to acquire the expertise to put teams together. There is an enormous amount of road planning going on. There are about 30 projects across the State, particularly along the six main corridors, and we want to see that work continue. There are delays in some cases, but there are also projects substantially ahead of schedule. Most of the significant delays have been due to the fact that environmental impact studies and other environmental works could not take place during the summer because of difficulties and protests.</P>

The Government has endeavoured to make available very attractive financial arrangements to resolve the problem, on top of what are already fairly attractive payments. We have been endeavouring to find a solution. If we do not, the roads programme will be substantially delayed. The Cabinet committee, which I chair, certainly does not want this to happen. While there are some difficulties in other roads projects, we will be able to make up quite an amount of time. I hope with more attractive tendering prices we will also get better value for money than in recent years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The multifaceted campaign against international terrorism is being pursued across a wide front. Ireland is particularly involved through the United Nations and the European Union. We are also active at a national level. The UN Security Council reacted swiftly to the events of 11 September by unanimously adopting Resolution 1368 which condemned the attacks and called on all states to work together to bring the perpetrators to justice and prevent and suppress international terrorism.</P>
      <P>Following on from Resolution 1368, the Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1373 on 28 September. The resolution imposes obligations on member states under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and particularly emphasises measures which must be taken to combat the financing of terrorism. Member states are obliged to report on actions taken to those ends within 90 days. As President of the Security Council, Ireland moved quickly to ensure the establishment of the committee provided for in Resolution 1373 to monitor the implementation of the resolution. Both UN resolutions reaffirm the inherent right to individual and collective self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.</P>
      <P>Action at EU level has been equally intense. On 21 September EU Heads of State or Government reaffirmed their commitment to take concerted action against terrorism and make it a priority objective of the European Union. They agreed to pursue a wide range of judicial co-operation measures. These include Commission proposals for Council framework decisions on combating terrorism and the introduction of a European arrest warrant. I will be attending a special meeting of the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg tomorrow to review actions taken and planned in response to the 11 September attacks. Our meeting will report to the Ghent informal European Council on 19 October. The Government has moved quickly to set up internal arrangements to co-ordinate the follow through on our national responsibilities under the UN and EU initiatives, including seeking to provide additional time in the House to deal with the necessary legislative measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the security front, the United States and its allies began military action on 7 October against the military assets of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the terrorist bases of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network in that country. I regret <Col N="195" /> that such action proved necessary. However, the Taliban has refused for two years to comply with demands of the UN Security Council that it hand over Mr. bin Laden and his associates and close terrorist camps operating in areas under its control. It continued its defiance even after the terrorist attacks of 11 September, which Mr. bin Laden has since openly applauded.</P>
    <P>The Government has been assured that the military action being undertaken by the United States and its allies is targeted and focused and that every effort is being made to avoid civilian casualties. This is essential. The people of Afghanistan are not responsible for the atrocities of 11 September and are themselves victims of prolonged violence and the extremism of the Taliban regime. The Government is concerned that the people of Afghanistan should be able to live under a government which enjoys a broad level of popular support across the various ethnic groups which make up the country. The UN Security Council has been seeking progress in this area for some time. In this regard, I welcome the appointment by the UN Secretary General of a special representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and guarantee him Ireland's full support in his efforts. We will stay in close touch with him.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>The Government has also been working vigorously and proactively to help resolve the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. It has been, from the moment Ireland assumed its seat on the Security Council, to the forefront in ensuring the humanitarian position is given international priority. I raised the issue in the course of my various meetings in Washington and New York in September. As a result, we have arranged for ongoing briefings of the Security Council on the humanitarian position in Afghanistan. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, underscored this priority at the special meeting of EU Development Ministers, which was convened in Brussels on 10 October. The European Union has made 316 million available in response to the humanitarian emergency.</P>
    <P>This is a fast evolving situation in which it remains difficult to measure needs accurately. It requires a variety of flexible humanitarian responses which are being co-ordinated by the UN lead agencies in the field. Contingency plans have been put in place to meet the various possible scenarios of need. Food stocks are being put in place and the UN High Commission for Refugees is preparing for a possible initial increase in refugees of 1.5 million. The UNHCR is also working to open six new camps along the Pakistan border with capacity for 300,000 people. New camps along the Iranian border will similarly provide for 200,000 people. The World Food Programme is also working flat out to provide the necessary food stocks for those people at risk within Afghanistan's borders.</P>
    <P>Bilaterally, we have provided £4 million in <Col N="196" /> humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan since the start of this year. This is one of the largest contributions ever made by an Irish Government to a single emergency reflecting the enormous gravity of the crisis. We are vigorously pursuing a number of humanitarian priorities, namely, getting aid to the people of Afghanistan before the onset of winter, positioning emergency food stocks, protecting aid workers and the vulnerable population and keeping borders open to refugees. Irish NGOs are reviewing their programmes on a daily basis. Ireland Aid is in close daily contact with its partner NGOs and international organisations to ensure the aid we are providing gets to those who need it in the most effective manner.</P>

      <P>I focus on the humanitarian position in Afghanistan. While I appreciate the announcements made by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, on moneys from Ireland and additional moneys following the EU Development Co-operation Council meeting, I am concerned about the logistics. With winter approaching, it is clear that dropping food aid parcels will not solve the problem. Does the Minister recognise and accept that the most difficult part of the humanitarian problem is the logistics? Have there been any serious discussions on ways of overcoming these logistical problems to bring in the massive quantities of food aid which are needed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we have had a number of discussions. When I visited the United Nations at the beginning of our presidency I made arrangements to discuss these matters with the OCHA which is handling this problem. There is a huge logistical challenge. Precisely because of the magnitude of the problems the UN Secretary General appointed Mr. Brahimi as special co-ordinator of the effort. As the House will know, Mr. Brahimi brought forward a report on the reform of peacekeeping arrangements in the United Nations and is regarded as a very able administrator and official who enjoys the full confidence of the Secretary General.</P>
      <P>Ambassador Ryan spoke to Mr. Brahimi yesterday in his capacity within the Presidency. Mr. Brahimi will meet the Secretary General today and I will telephone him this evening. He is taking soundings from other members of the Security Council and intends visiting the area before returning to the Security Council within a week, probably next Tuesday or Wednesday, to put to it the proposals he feels are necessary having discussed the position with everyone concerned, including Iran and Pakistan, and taking into account the Indian dimension. It is, therefore, important to recognise that the UN Secretary General has moved quickly in appointing Mr. Brahimi with the necessary co-ordinating functions and that he is now dealing with the task. This function is in addition to the work already being carried out by the World Food Programme, the OCHA and the UNHCR.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware of concerns that food aid will get into the wrong hands. Two further specific questions arise. Is there a procedure in place to allow substantial transport of food aid and other equipment such as temporary shelters through aid corridors? Has there been progress on opening Afghanistan's borders with adjoining countries? These two central issues might contribute substantially to the resolution of the humanitarian catastrophe that confronts the people of Afghanistan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 11 September the Taliban regime has held a very strict view about who may cross the border. However, local personnel have been working with UN personnel inside Afghanistan since 1998. This has resulted in some successful efforts to get food into the country, but not to the desired extent given the number of vulnerable persons in Afghanistan who, according to estimates, will require assistance in the coming months. It is important to point out that food stocks are being put in place. The UN High Commission for Refugees is preparing for a possible increase in refugees of 1.5 million and seeking to open six new camps along the Pakistan border with a capacity for 300,000 people. New camps along the Iranian border will, similarly, provide for 200,000 people.

We are vigorously pursuing a number of humanitarian priorities, namely, getting aid to the people of Afghanistan before the onset of winter, positioning emergency food stocks, protecting aid workers and the vulnerable population and keeping borders open to refugees. A further major hindrance to this work, for which the Taliban has been vociferously criticised by the UN Secretary General, is its taking of food for its own purposes. Ireland Aid is in close contact with partner NGOs and international organisations daily to ensure the aid we are providing gets to those who need it in the most effective manner. During my discussions with the OCHA, Ms McCaskey with whom we spoke there, informed us that the OCHA believes somewhere in the region of 54,000 tonnes of food per month will need to be made available to Afghanistan. That will be a huge challenge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The General Affairs Council, which met in Luxembourg on 8 October 2001, declared its full solidarity with the United States and wholehearted support for the action being taken in self-defence and in conformity with the UN Charter and UN Resolution 1368. The Council stressed that the carefully targeted action launched on 7 October was not an attack on Islam nor the people of Afghanistan, whom the European Union is determined to support and sustain.</P>
      <P>I presume the second part of the Deputy's question refers to a story in <i>The Examiner</i> of 9 October which reported my response to a question as to whether the United States had the right to take military action against additional countries which it had identified as harbouring terrorists who had attacked it. I replied that, according to the circumstances, the United States had the right to take targeted and proportionate action either under its inherent right to self-defence or under Resolution 1368, providing it had the necessary evidence of that state's involvement in terrorist activity directed against it.</P>
      <P>That said, I very much hope the United States will not find it necessary to undertake military action beyond the targeted action under way in the areas of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban regime. The Government is firmly of the view that military action should be undertaken only as a last resort after all other means of persuasion have been exhausted. Regrettably, military action against the Taliban was the consequence of its sustained refusal to respond to the demands of the international community, even in the face of UN sanctions, to hand over Osama bin Laden and close the terrorist camps operating from within the territory under its control. The US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, emphasised to me on 7 October that the US and its allies were targeting AI Qaeda camps and Taliban military installations. The British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, conveyed a similar message to EU Foreign Ministers at our meeting in Luxembourg on 8 October. I am not aware of any evidence which demonstrates that other States were knowingly involved in harbouring those who planned or executed the 11 September atrocities. It has not been mentioned in my contacts with the US or its military allies, that other possible targets for military action are under active consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred in the second part of my question to the report in <i>The Irish Times </i>as well as to the report in <i>The Examiner </i>in which there is a clear difference between what the Minister has just said and what, for example, Jack Straw, the British Foreign Secretary, has said. Does the Minister think it is a reasonable interpretation of resolution 1368 that the United States could interpret any threat in any State and under the purposes of this resolution, take action such as it has taken already in Afghanistan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister speaks about the conditions attached to 1368 which refer to proportionality &ndash;<Col N="199" /> bringing to justice and the security of civilians &ndash; what information has he got most recently on the position of civilians, seeing that there are now 1.2 million more refugees than there were there originally and to which he has referred in a previous response?</P>
    <P>I note the Minister's colleague, the &ldquo;Minister for Aid&rdquo; is here. Does the Minister not feel that the international humanitarian relief and development aid effort has been almost irrevocably damaged by the militarisation of the aid programme &ndash; the suggestion that one can drop rations from the sky behind the line of advance of the Northern Alliance while at the same time the Taliban, through the closing of the borders, has impeded the world relief programme which cannot adequately distribute food?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the first question: I have the transcript of that interview in Luxembourg and the question asked was:</P>
      <P>If the United States were to go about its military campaign beyond Afghanistan, would you continue to support it?</P>
      <P>The answer was:</P>
      <P>Well obviously, as I say, what is required here is the exercise of self-defence and the question of the identification of the threat is a very important issue. As of now, the threat has been identified in respect of Al Quaeda and other groups being harboured by Taliban. If there was evidence to suggest that other regimes were harbouring these terrorists or training them, then clearly that is another situation that arises, so at the moment we are dealing with the situation as is.</P>
      <P>That is my answer to the question. The reason I say that is simply this: it is the hypothesis of what would happen if there were a country &ldquo;B&rdquo; involved. In international law, the international threat to peace and security has been identified as the events of 11 September. The inherent right to self defence is available to any country against whom a threat or a continuing threat is posed. If country &ldquo;B&rdquo;&ndash; and this is a hypothesis at this stage &ndash; were involved in harbouring the same terrorists who were responsible for the events of 11 September, then clearly the same legal principles apply. I went no further than that; that is not an advocacy of a position; it is simply a frank reply to a question.</P>
      <P>I was asked in what circumstances do the legal principles apply to other countries if any. They would only apply in the same circumstances and the same circumstances would have to be a regime which is harbouring these terrorists, allowing its territory to be used for training camps and is posing a continuing threat. There is no more nor less involved in that reply. It is a logical, rational reply in the situation and consistent with international legal principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The political reality we are dealing with at the <Col N="200" /> moment is that there is no evidence of any imminent attack on any other country or regime other than the Taliban regime and the Al Quaeda network. That is the situation as things stand today.</P>
    <P>I will speak about the food programme and perhaps the Deputy can remind me of what the second supplementary question was. The UN has provided assistance to the poor people of Afghanistan for more than 12 years, since 1988. It would be far better if this were done in the absence of military action and military action would not be required if we were dealing with a regime that complied with Security Council resolutions 1269, 1333, 1368 and 1373. Rather than jumping to the third step, if it was a regime with any concern for the needs of its own people, it would not harbour terrorists and international law would be able to deal with them. I still appeal to the Taliban regime to allow more humanitarian relief for the internally displaced people and the many millions of vulnerable people who will suffer even greater hardships unless this matter is resolved one way or the other.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Fully-committed membership of the European Union has been of great benefit to Ireland and will continue to be essential to our national development. That fundamental reality must form the basis of our approach to the present situation.</P>
      <P>The Government remains committed to the enlargement of the European Union, and we recognise that the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is necessary for enlargement to proceed. The Taoiseach and I made our position clear to our EU partners and to the applicant states in the period immediately after our referendum, including at the Gothenburg European Council, and we continue to do so on all appropriate occasions. Our partners have made clear their readiness to contribute in every possible way to help the Government find a way forward. They appreciate that time is needed to enable us to reflect fully on all the concerns which arose and to reach conclusions.</P>
      <P>That process of reflection is continuing. It is clear that many factors contributed to the defeat of the referendum and to the very poor turnout. By no means were all of these directly related to the treaty itself. Accordingly, it seems clear that our response to the situation will have to be multi-faceted. A central aspect of the process of reflection will be the work of the National Forum on Europe, which meets for the first time on Thursday. While I regret that Fine Gael does not for the moment intend to take part, the forum will allow for a very broadly based and wide ranging debate on Ireland's participation in the European Union, and on the overall functioning and future development of the Union, including in the context of enlargement. While we see the forum as ranging much more widely than the Treaty of Nice itself, we hope it will promote genuine and well-informed discussion of many of the issues which arose during the campaign and will contribute to an improved public understanding of the Union and its activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as it emerges that there may be matters related to the Treaty of Nice on which clari<Col N="202" /> fication could usefully be sought, without re-opening the text of the treaty, the Government would consider raising these issues with our partners at an appropriate time, bearing in mind their commitment to help find a way forward.</P>
    <P>As many of the issues which arose were related more to the longer-term future of the Union than to the Treaty of Nice, the Government also recognises the importance of ensuring that the Future of Europe debate, which is to culminate in a further Intergovernmental Conference in 2004, has as an overriding objective, the strengthening of the connection between the Union and its people. It must be grounded in a realistic appreciation of what people want and need from the Union. I have made this point strongly to my European colleagues, including at last week's meeting of the General Affairs Council.</P>
    <P>The Government, in line with the commitment I gave during the Second Stage debate on the Labour Party's European Union Bill, is also considering how Oireachtas scrutiny of European Union matters might be enhanced. It is the intention to come forward with initial proposals before too long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Has there been any analysis by the Government, in the four months since the referendum, of the theme which dominated the debate and why it is felt that the referendum was not successful? At this stage, has the Government any proposals under consideration to deal with the consequences of the referendum? I do not accept the setting up of a forum as being an answer from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly better than sitting alone in a corner and being ignored. I understand there is some EU Commission research due for publication shortly, in relation to public opinion surveys on the issues and what influenced people during the campaign and that should make interesting reading. I understand that Professor Sinnott of Trinity College is preparing, on behalf of the Commission, an analysis which will be in the public domain in due course. It is important that we should not be prescriptive at this stage. The advice offered to the Government was to take account of analysis from all sides. I do not believe the forum will bring about any artificial consensus and there are certain issues on which there will not be full agreement in this House. That is the democratic position and we have no problem with it. However, we need a structure for transparent and open debate on many issues, which will helpfully inform Members of the House, members of the forum and the general public and re-engage the public on the issues as to what is in our interest in going forward, recognising there are different views within Europe but that should not militate against the fact that our essential national interests are confirmed within membership of the European Union. If we had been prescriptive, we would now be accused of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> pre-empting the forum's deliberations on this aspect of its work, which will not be the only aspect of its work. I gave assurances to parties in the House who agreed to participate that we would not seek to corral or channel the debate in any particular way. Accordingly, we can have, on its merits, a good debate on all the issues from all perspectives and then, having listened and, perhaps, taken an interim report from the forum on those aspects of its deliberations, the Government can come forward in the context of its primary responsibility to put a position to the people, in due course. We will not be rushed to judgment in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not get involved in the forum issue. The Minister knows I do not agree that engaging in a non-binding open ended talking shop will achieve anything. Does he agree there is need for some Government leadership, for an analysis of the causes of the problem? The Minister should look at a very good paper which was completed on this, by Professor Laffan, some weeks after the referendum. Even more importantly, is there not a need for the Government to come forward with proposals for consideration as to how the matter is to be handled, with the aid of our European partners and domestically? That would provide some evidence of Government leadership on the issue at this stage. Is the Minister saying that will not be done, that everything will be lofted over to a sub-committee and buried in the forum for God knows how long? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it will not be left to rest indefinitely in the forum. The Government does not intend to have a break in the enlargement process, which must be completed by the end of 2002. It does not reflect very well on a party claiming pro-European credentials to suggest that nothing can be achieved in what the Deputy calls a talking shop. That the forum does not have executive power does not prevent it from doing a very valuable job. The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation did a very valuable job and the New Ireland Forum did an outstandingly valuable job. If Fine Gael is trying to find some rationalisation for not participating in this exercise, it should find a better one than that. I am sure many of the Deputy's colleagues in the European People's Party would be interested to hear why Fine Gael is not getting involved in the debate on the future of Europe. That is what is in the Nice declaration, which involves every member state and all parties associated with the European People's Party will be involved. The Fine Gael Party is looking foolish and it is time its members copped themselves on.</P>

      <Quest>the number of Irish-born people killed or injured on 11 September 2001 in the US following attacks in New York, Washington DC and Pennsylvania; the condition of those injured; the services the Irish Consular Service was able to offer and continues to offer to the families of those killed or injured; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the information compiled by my Department in Dublin and in the United States, we now believe that eight Irish-born people were killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York. We are not aware of any Irish-born people killed in the attack on the Pentagon or the crash near Pittsburgh. I stress that this figure is based on the names of Irish citizens compiled by and communicated to my Department. Unfortunately, although I believe this to be unlikely, there may have been other Irish citizens caught up in this tragedy who have not yet been notified to us and, there were, tragically, very many Irish-American victims of the outrage. I am aware of only one Irish-born person who was injured and hospitalised for a number of days and I am happy to say that this person has since been discharged and has returned to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Immediately the news of the attacks broke, my Department established a crisis centre to assist Irish people seeking information about friends or relatives who might have been affected. Emergency services were also set up by our Embassy in Washington and by our consulates in New York and Boston, and the whole system, between our US missions and the Department, operated in a fully integrated manner.</P>
      <P>A free phone help line service was set up in Ireland and a team of more than 50 volunteers, including staff from other Departments, worked around the clock answering calls and building up a database of more than 2,500 Irish people about whom concerns had been registered. The Department of Health and Children very helpfully provided a team of counsellors to assist relatives in coping with the trauma of the events and also provided advice and support to the staff of the crisis centre. I am deeply grateful to all involved, who enthusiastically offered their services and whose work was in the finest tradition of the Irish public service. Thankfully, the overwhelming majority of persons reported to the crisis centre turned up safe and well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In New York, the consulate attempted to verify the whereabouts of any missing Irish people. Consulate officials visited hospitals to verify reports of Irish injured. In a number of cases, they also visited addresses provided by relatives who were unable to make contact with their family member. To the extent possible, efforts were made to ascertain whether companies which had offices in the World Trade Center had any Irish employees affected by the disaster. Inquiries were <Col N="205" /> likewise made with construction companies and sub-contractors who might have been in the area at the time of the incident. The consulate held regular meetings and discussions with Irish immigrant groups to ensure maximum follow-up on reports of missing persons and casualties.</P>
    <P>Since 11 September, consulate staff have maintained close contact with the New York police department. We deeply appreciate the assistance provided by it in registering missing persons and checking lists of the dead and injured, in what was also a very difficult time for the police department. All possible assistance was provided to relatives who travelled to New York and many of them were met on arrival by representatives of the consulate. Not all families required assistance but, where requested, the consulate provided support, such as booking accommodation and meeting relatives at the airport. Assistance was extended not only to the relatives of Irish-born but also to relatives of US-born Irish citizens missing at the World Trade Center.</P>
    <P>When in New York at the end of September, I was able, and on behalf of the Government, this House and the people, to express my deep sorrow to Governor Pataki and Mayor Giuliani at the tragedy which had occurred and to express my sympathy to the families of the victims. I attended a special memorial service for Irish and Irish-American victims arranged by the consulate. I also had a detailed meeting with the Irish immigrant groups with which we had been working closely. I thanked them for the enormous support and assistance they were providing to the Irish-American community in the aftermath of the attacks. In recognition of this work, I announced a special Government grant of $300,000 to assist these groups in dealing with the consequences of this tragedy.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any information on the whereabouts of four Cavan men who were reported to have been seriously injured and sent to St. Vincent's Hospital, but about whom no further information has become available?

Is it the case that these people have not been discovered, that they were not injured in the attacks and that no family can be identified as having reported these people missing?

      <P>Following our intensive discussions with the parties at Weston Park in July, the two Governments put a package of proposals to the parties at the beginning of August which we believe can deliver the full and early implementation of outstanding aspects of the Agreement. We have since been working to secure further progress.</P>
      <P>On policing, we have reached a situation where appointments, including representatives of both communities, have now been made to the new policing board and a chair and vice-chair have been appointed. I am disappointed that all parties did not feel able to make nominations at this point. As I have said before, and as I firmly believe, all that is now available can, if implemented, comprehensively deliver the spirit and the substance of Patten. I commend the parties that have made nominations and I hope that when they see how matters evolve, others will also decide to come on board.</P>
      <P>On the institutions and on decommissioning, however, the situation remains less clear. Deputies will be aware that having failed to have a motion to exclude Sinn Féin passed by the Assembly and having withdrawn its Ministers from the Executive, the UUP has said its members will now resign from the Executive. This would be a most serious development. It is crucial that all parties ensure the institutions are allowed to operate fully, on a stable and inclusive basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> On decommissioning, and while the agreement reached between the IRA and the Independent Commission on Decommissioning in August on a method for putting arms beyond use was a hugely important development, the decision to take it off the table was disappointing. The Government, however, took considerable encouragement from the subsequent IRA statement in which it undertook to intensify its engagement with the commission. The reality remains that, as the Governments said at Weston Park, putting arms beyond use is an indispensable part of implementing the Good Friday Agreement, and this matter must be resolved in a manner acceptable to and verified by the Independent Commission.</P>
    <P>There is clearly an urgent need to make immediate progress. We need, in particular, to see early and tangible progress on the putting of arms beyond use to the satisfaction of the commission and we need to see the stability of the institutions secured. In the ugly events in the streets of north Belfast, and in the callous and cowardly murder of the journalist, Martin O'Hagan &ndash; events that compelled the Secretary of State to conclude that the UDA, UFF and LVF are no longer observing ceasefires &ndash; we are starkly reminded of the dangers of allowing a political vacuum to develop. Political drift can only play into the hands of those who seek to raise tensions and to bring the Agreement down.</P>
    <P>It is vital that confidence and momentum be restored and that all parties, collectively and individually, do all in their power to overcome the present impasse and to demonstrate to all sides that politics can be made to work, including in the critical demilitarisation area. The Government will remain in close contact with the parties and the British Government to see what more can be done to advance the situation.</P>
    <P>I join with those tributes that have already been paid in the House to political leaders in the North who have already or who are about to stand down from leadership positions. In this regard, Seán Neeson played an honourable role as leader of the Alliance Party. I wish his successor, David Ford, every success in his new role.</P>
    <P>I need hardly inform the House of the enormously high regard in which John Hume and Séamus Mallon are held throughout the country. In their long political careers, they have played an incomparable part in helping us to secure a just and lasting peace on this island. Redoubling our efforts to build on their work and to see the Agreement implemented in full must surely be the best and most appropriate tribute we can pay them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the tributes paid to John Hume, Séamus Mallon and Seán Neeson. Does the Minister agree that the leadership of the SDLP, in particular, did something tremendous for this country and these islands, especially in the years when, if the provisional republic movement had been able to claim a mandate from the <Col N="208" /> Nationalist people of Northern Ireland, the situation would have been much worse? In those circumstances, the SDLP held that line.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the widespread speculation that a start is about to begin to putting weapons beyond use. I am not sure from where that speculation is coming. Does he agree that the most recent speculation was from the Archbishop of Armagh this morning? Given that some individual or organisation is spreading this word, does the Minister know from where it is coming and does he believe it to be accurate? If, hopefully, it happens, does he believe it will be sufficient for political progress to recommence?</P>
      <P>On policing, I am sure the Minister shares my disappointment that it was not possible for Sinn Féin to either join the policing board or to advise its supporters to do so. Does the Minister agree that the probability is that there was never any intention on the part of Sinn Féin to do either of those things? In the republican heartland I know best, in east and south Tyrone, there is no belief among mainline republicans that such was the intention. Does the Minister accept there must be such a doubt in relation to that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is open for people to be sceptical and to remain convinced as regards this step in terms of actual decommissioning and the need for it to occur. People can have their doubts if they wish based on their experiences or their understanding of the situation. It is true that in the implementation of this indispensable part of the Agreement, we are talking about historic shifts being made by people who in the past have perhaps indicated that there was no prospect, certainly prior to negotiating the Good Friday Agreement. However, efforts are being made to ensure the Agreement is implemented in all its aspects, including on this issue.</P>
      <P>We have seen at times &ndash; too often perhaps &ndash; an attempt to relegate this Agreement to a single item agenda, which it is not. By the same token, it is not possible to suggest that the Agreement does not include this item. Given the Deputy's own experience, it would, therefore, be better for us to wait and see if those who have influence in these matters can bring the necessary trust and confidence that is absent back into the process and that there would be reciprocation on the other side regarding its commitment to work to the full the institutions as envisaged and as agreed in the Good Friday Agreement. The reduction of the security threat that would represent would accelerate further normalisation measures, particularly in the areas of demilitarisation.</P>

      <P>Ireland is an energetic advocate of disarmament and non-proliferation and considers the pursuit of these issues within the United Nations and in other fora to be a key element of our contribution towards international security.</P>
      <P>Within the United Nations system the Security Council does not have immediate responsibility for the issues of arms production, proliferation and disarmament. The UN Charter vests in the General Assembly the prime responsibility for consideration of the &ldquo;general principles of co-operation in the maintenance of international peace and security, including the principles governing disarmament and the regulation of armaments&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Much of the practical work of devising general principles takes place in the UN Disarmament and International Security Committee, commonly known as the First Committee, of which Ireland is a member. The First Committee meets during the UN General Assembly session to deal with the disarmament issues on the agenda of that session, and its consultations shape the tone of the disarmament debate. Ireland is an active participant in this committee and will this year, as always, use all useful opportunities to ensure the pursuit of disarmament and non-proliferation stays at the fore of the committee's deliberations and output.</P>
      <P>With regard to nuclear weapons, Ireland is a member of the New Agenda Coalition which has been highly instrumental in achieving a detailed and agreed outcome to the 2000 Review Conference of the Non-proliferation Treaty. The outcome there provides a blueprint for a step by step approach to negotiations leading to the elimination of nuclear arsenals.</P>
      <P>Since August 1999, Ireland has also become a member of the Conference on Disarmament which has in the past proved productive in negotiating multilateral disarmament agreements. The conference negotiated most recently the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which seeks to prevent the further testing of nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>The UN Conference on the Illicit Trafficking of Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects took place in New York in July of this year and agreed an international action plan to combat this illegal trafficking. The Irish delegation was fully engaged in the preparatory work and the successful conclusion of the plan of action at this conference. We are committed to the implementation of this plan of action which has a special relevance to the African continent.</P>

The Irish delegation <Col N="210" /> was fully engaged in the preparatory work and the successful conclusion of the plan of action at this conference. We are committed to the implementation of this plan of action which has a special relevance to the African continent.</P>
    <P>In that context, in the case of Angola, Ireland, as a member of the UN Security Council, is playing a very active role through its chairmanship of the United Nations Sanctions Committee Against UNITA (Angola). The sanctions, which include a ban on armaments, have an important role to play in bringing the tragic conflict in Angola to an end.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>As can be gathered from what I have said, the United Nations deals with the issues of arms production and proliferation in a broad multilateral context, which is distinct from Ireland's participation in, and chairing of, the Security Council. Nonetheless, Ireland will continue to use its voice and influence where it can be useful in making progress on the vital issues of arms production and proliferation.</P>
    <P>In all our efforts on these important issues, we remain conscious of the commitment made by the leaders of all UN member states on the occasion of the Millennium Summit in New York last September. The Declaration which they made, <i>inter alia</i>, addressed the interrelated issues of development, peace, security and disarmament, and specifically the need to implement treaties in arms control and disarmament, to strive for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, and to end illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons.</P>
    <P>In compliance with these undertakings, the UN Secretary General is preparing a progress report on implementation for consideration at the next regular session of the General Assembly. For our part, Ireland will continue to use multilateral avenues to curb arms production and to end the proliferation of all categories of weapon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather sad and depressing reply, but I will ask a question about it. Listening to it, one can understand why in 1995 about $868 billion was spent on arms production and $15 billion on the four preventable diseases in the world that have cost 150 million lives since the UN was founded. However, I asked what initiative the Government might take while it was on the Security Council. Obviously the answer is that it intends to go to all the committees it went to before. It has reported how active it will be on the Angola sanctions committee for the people who buy arms. My question also mentions small arms, which include portable rocket launchers. That negotiation has collapsed. The Minister might tell us about that but not waste too much time on it. The United States does not intend signing the convention on it. In terms of the obscenity of expenditure on arms production outpacing that on preventable diseases by somewhere between 65:1 and 70:1, would it not be a reasonable expectation that the Minister would <Col N="211" /> prepare an initiative? He should move it to the General Assembly through the committee, as he correctly said. What the Minister has told us is that he goes to the committee meetings, and he has told us what goes on, but there is nothing by way of an initiative.</P>

Given that the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings killed 210,000 people, will the Minister take the opportunity afforded by his role on the Security Council to highlight the bomb-making possibilities and explosive nature of the Sellafield plant across the Irish Sea? Will he take account of the views of Dr. Gordon Thompson, who met Members of Dáil Éireann on a number of occasions, that a world forum such as the United Nations Security Council would be an ideal forum in which to put in place what he called a grand contract to change the nuclear industry from a potential bomb-making and waste-making industry to a clean-up industry, using the expertise in the nuclear industry for clean-ups as is being done in Eastern Europe and other nuclear-contaminated areas?

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he has taken steps to express to the British authorities his concern at the treatment of children attending the Holy Cross primary school in Ardoyne, Belfast; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[21439/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The protest directed at young school children and their parents as they make their way to and from Holy Cross primary school in Ardoyne has now entered its seventh week. Over the course of the protest, these children have been subjected to appalling physical and verbal abuse, sectarian taunting and intimidation. On 5 September, a blast-bomb was thrown at the children as they walked up to the school. Each day, they have needed the protection of a large number of police officers, some of whom have been injured in the course of their work, and whom we commend.</P>
      <P>No civilised society can tolerate a situation whereby school children, some as young as four years of age, are treated in this disgraceful fashion. Let me be very clear about this &ndash; these protests are wrong. No grievance, real or perceived, can justify such protests or the dreadful behaviour of the protesters towards these children. Whatever the concerns of the Glenbryn protesters, whatever problems may exist between the Glenbryn and Ardoyne communities, there can be no justification for a protest directed against young children. They are not the cause of such problems. This is not a legitimate form of protest. The protest at Holy Cross School should stop immediately.</P>
      <P>These children have the right to go to school in safety and peace, without having to face abuse or intimidation. The parents have the right to ensure their children's education. The rights of the children are sacrosanct in this dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> Hopes that a resolution was in sight were raised last week when direct dialogue took place between the Ardoyne parents and Glenbryn residents. These talks have not, as yet, resulted in an end to the protests. I urge local elected and community representatives in both Glenbryn and Ardoyne to redouble their efforts in the coming days to facilitate inter-community dialogue and local agreement. No community interest is served by violence, by fomenting sectarianism or by targeting young children.</P>
    <P>I have raised the Government's grave concerns about the protest at the Holy Cross school with the Secretary of State on a number of occasions. My officials have also been in ongoing contact with the British authorities since the protest started. We have been assured that the security forces will continue to provide protection to the children and parents on a daily basis for as long as the protests continue. We have also been kept informed of the efforts being made by the British Government and the Executive to facilitate dialogue and to address the wider concerns of the two communities in Ardoyne and Glenbryn.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement affirmed the right of people to live their lives free from sectarian harassment. If these words are to mean anything, they must surely apply to young schoolchildren. We will continue to work with the British Government to ensure that this right is protected and vindicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister comment on the most recent proposal by the manager of the school? Does he regard it as a fall-back position or as an indication that progress is being made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The board of management of the school has done everything possible in this situation. It has made a number of proposals during the course of this dispute. I would listen very carefully, and ask the parents and children to listen to what he has to say. The point must also be made that if there are parents and children who wish to go to school along that route, they are entitled to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us would disagree with what the Minister has said. What is happening in Ardoyne is an abominable abuse of children. Has the Minister had any feedback or contact with any of the loyalist leaders as to what is behind this grievance which seems quite unique in terms of the severity of the taunting of children, although I am sure we would hear of other examples if we dug deep enough? Is there any intention to try to get to the bottom of what is driving the bitterness and the hatred here, to find out whether there is a level of deprivation, a level of resources, and whether some form of mini-peace process is required? Has the Minister been instrumental in bringing forward such an initiative?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>While there have been blatant <Col N="214" /> cases of murder and intimidation directed towards the Protestant community, under no circumstances does this justify what has been happening in recent times. I have always supported the right to peaceful protest and I established that a long time ago. However, does the Minister agree that given the naked bigotry which has been exhibited to small children we might have reached the stage where other measures ought to be taken? This has passed the stage where the right of peaceful protest is the primary consideration. Other factors must now be taken into consideration, namely, the naked bigotry so obviously exhibited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We share the Minister's sense of horror and shock at what is happening to these young children. Can he explain why the police appear to be so impotent in stopping it? The children are trying to get to school every day. Why can the police not stop what is happening by using the law in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be fair to direct criticism at the police in this situation. They have acted with commendable resolve and even-handedness. They have faced danger and have suffered serious injury. The police are doing as good a job as could be expected in the face of what has been, at times, an extremely difficult and dangerous situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been efforts at a number of levels. There have been efforts at local community level to get spokespersons to meet and resolve matters. There was a meeting in Stormont on 9 October on how to resolve the matter and bring the protest to an end. Efforts are being made to address the security concerns of the two communities and the wider socio-economic issues affecting Glenbryn and Ardoyne. On 10 October, the NIO Security Minister announced additional security measures for the area, particularly the erection of a peace line between Glenbryn Park and Alliance Avenue. An interdepartmental group has been set up to look into the concerns of the community and among the issues being examined are housing, special education, counselling, security and reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, a liaison officer has been appointed by the Executive. His role is to act as the person on the ground for the Executive. He is based in the community and will provide an accessible channel through which the local communities can express their concerns. We all hope the genuine efforts being made on a number of levels will meet with early success.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business, I have the honour to extend a warm welcome to the Secretary of State to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Tunisia, Mr. Youssef Mokkadem, accompanied by the Tunisian ambassador, who join us in the distinguished Visitors Gallery this afternoon. Your visit demonstrates the continuing co-operation and friendship between our two parliaments and countries. I express the confident hope that this visit will increase that co-operation and friendship, and that it will be to our mutual benefit.</P>

      <P>The Council of Transport Ministers meeting in Brussels, at which the Minister for Public Enterprise is in attendance, is due to conclude around now. Will the Taoiseach indicate what progress, if any, the Minister has made at the meeting and will he further indicate whether the purpose of his meeting in Brussels tomorrow with the European Commission is to raise the issue of Aer Lingus? Will the Taoiseach state pre<Col N="223" /> cisely what is Government policy in regard to providing equity or loan guarantees to Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the crisis in the airline industry is a critical issue for a number of EU countries whose national airlines are in a similar position to Aer Lingus, will the Taoiseach indicate whether it is his intention to formally raise this matter at the informal heads of government summit in Ghent on Friday and Saturday? If so, has he made preparatory contact with the governments of other similarly affected countries with a view to building some kind of alliance which would ensure we could find a political solution to this political problem which arose as a result of the events of 11 September? The American Administration was prepared to change its rules in regard to the provision of financial support to troubled airlines.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise received the survival plan from Aer Lingus yesterday morning before departing for Luxembourg. The Minister is today attending a meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers and, prior to its commencement, met Commissioner de Palacio to discuss the Irish situation and outline reasons for the Government to assist Aer Lingus. The Government's policy is to ensure Aer Lingus survives and to save as many jobs as possible &ndash; somewhere in the region of 4,000. We want to ensure the contents of the survival plan are agreed between Aer Lingus management and staff. Discussions in that regard commenced in recent weeks and the Government will support them in whatever way it can. I had not received a report from the Minister for Public Enterprise prior to the commencement of</P>
      <P>Question Time. Five countries are currently</P>
      <P>experiencing serious difficulties in this area and their ministers have spelt out their predicaments in Europe, as the Minister for Public Enterprise has done. I await with interest the outcome of the meeting.</P>
      <P>The Commission meeting scheduled for tomorrow is not to discuss the crisis in the airline industry. A practice has arisen whereby various prime ministers attend full Commission meetings on a monthly rota to discuss a range of issues that affect their countries. While the airline crisis is bound to arise, it is not the reason for the meeting. The meeting was arranged four or five months ago. I will take an opportunity tomorrow to highlight our difficulties.</P>
      <P>As regards the meeting at the weekend, I have no doubt these issues will arise, but I will wait to see what happens at the Transport Council and what happens tomorrow before I do whatever we have to do. Five countries have been in touch and the Transport Ministers have had a number of meetings. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, met her French and Belgian colleagues prior to today's meeting and she has also been in touch with her Greek and Austrian colleagues.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that at 4.30 p.m. this afternoon the European Transport Commissioner repeated that only limited state aid would be available or permitted in the wake of last month's attacks on the US? She also said that only compensation for flights cancelled for four days following the bombings in New York would be permitted by way of aid. In light of that, will the Taoiseach answer what I asked him, namely, what is the Government's policy now on State aid for Aer Lingus? Will he raise this issue as a priority with the full Commission at the meeting tomorrow in Brussels? Will he also raise this issue at the meeting in Ghent on Friday? Will he try to establish an alliance with the Governments of France, Italy and Portugal, all of whom have requested the Commission to relax the rules of state aid for aviation companies in trouble in Europe? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all Members would agree the European Union has been particularly successful in dealing with issues related to the environment and environmental protection because the problem of environmental pollution does not recognise national frontiers. Having regard to the outrageous decision of the British Secretary of State, Margaret Beckett, to commission the Magnox MOX plant in Sellafield and the serious <Col N="225" /> threat it poses to us in light of the vulnerability of these installations following 11 September, will the Taoiseach outline what action the Government will take through the courts in Britain, the European institutions and the international courts to ensure this massive target on our doorstep, which is closer to 50% of the population of this country than to a small section of the population in the United Kingdom, does not go ahead? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach raise with the British Government the possibility of implementing a no-fly zone in the vicinity of Sellafield? The assurances given to date that a terrorist attack on this new plant would not be successful and would not cause enormous problems both for populations in the vicinity and along the east coast of Ireland are not convincing. Will the Taoiseach raise the issue of a no-fly zone in the vicinity of the Sellafield plant if we are to take seriously the threats of terrorism visiting the United Kingdom as well as the United States? </P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Deputy Quinn's questions, three specific areas are being examined. We are proceeding with the arrangements on the OSPAR agreement, which is an arbitration process. Last Friday week a substantial agreement on the third party and various processes which must be followed under the OSPAR regulations was reached and signed off. That will continue. It is the view that it is useful, but perhaps it is not enough. Both those areas have been examined under EU and international law, which is tied into United Nations law. We are fast approaching the view that we may have to use all three of them to make a significant impact. Most of the work on the OSPAR Convention has been completed and most of the preparations are under way. It is a long drawn out process. For that reason, we looked at the EU aspects some time ago and we are now looking at the international laws which are tied into the UN laws. We will make every diplomatic effort to focus the British Government's attention on the importance of this issue to us. It outlined last week and subsequently in other discussions the independence of the agency that controls Sellafield. I find it difficult to understand how it is as independent as was stated, although I do not wish to state that the British Government is not giving me the factual position. I am examining the matter further. It seems a peculiar arrangement under its law. I will just use the word &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo; at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept the previous Administration was active in ensuring the proposal for underground storage facilities, which were subject to a planning inquiry, were defeated largely because of the direct and physical intervention at that oral hearing in the United Kingdom of Deputy Stagg when he was Minister of State? Does the Taoiseach agree the Minister for the Environment at that time, Deputy Howlin, established an interdepartmental and agency committee to mobilise all the expertise and relevant bodies, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney's General office, to pursue that matter? To the best of my knowledge, that group was stood down by the current Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Having regard to the changed circumstances where, because of a previous investment of £500 million, Secretary of State Beckett is saying it is justifiable for the British to proceed and to the fact this is an enormous target which affects this country more than the United Kingdom, can the Taoiseach do a little better than the OSPAR Convention?

If it is a question of recouping a £500 million investment to justify this decision, surely there must be another way within the European Union to address that issue. Can the Taoiseach give an undertaking to the House that, if necessary, the Irish State will take a leaf out of the book of a previous Administration and seek legal redress in Britain, including an injunction, to prevent the British authorities from proceeding with this matter? </P>

      <P>Many of the things Deputy Quinn said are being followed up. I have already said that on 5 October a delegation of officials from the Department of Public Enterprise, the Office of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor met their UK counterparts in London to discuss the status of the legal action under OSPAR, which has been followed through. We had to try to build up a coalition of countries which would support that. That was painstakingly done by the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, with a certain amount of success, but it must be followed <Col N="227" /> through. The objectives of the meeting were to agree the procedures leading to the establishment of the arbitration tribunal and that has moved on. I have also stated that taking an action within the United Kingdom is being looked at, although it was not discussed at that meeting, along with examining how we can use international law. We know the difficulty concerning this issue, everybody does.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was rushed through this House and the Seanad in its amended form. As a result there are differences between references in the Title and other sections in the Bill and the Standards in Public Office Act, 2001, which was originally intended to succeed the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 1(2) of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill states, &ldquo;The Electoral Acts, 1992 to 1999, and this Act may be cited together as the Electoral Acts, 1992 to 2001.&rdquo; However, the Standards in Public Office Act states that the Electoral Acts, 1992 to 1999, and the Standards in Public Office Act may be cited together as the Electoral Acts, 1992 to 2001. The collective Title of this legislation will be different to that in the Standards in Public Office Act.</P>
      <P>Similarly the Title of the Bill refers to amendments to the Local Elections Acts, 1994 to 1999. This would have been the correct statement of the amendments to be made at the time the Bill was published. However, since then the Houses have passed the Local Government Act, 2001, which in turn changes the electoral legislation in respect of local government. The Title and collective citation of the Bill before the House does not refer to the Local Government Act, 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that if this remains the case there will be a legal difficulty regarding the interpretation of this legislation and the manner in which the courts may deal with it. This has arisen because of the sequencing of the legislation. Much of this legislation was dealt with quickly before the summer. There would have been no difficulties if the sequence had been as originally intended. However, the sequence is out of kilter and this Bill is back in the House due to the Seanad amendment. As a result, technical <Col N="233" /> amendments have to be made to it which arise from the passage of time.</P>
    <P>I also draw attention to a number of drafting amendments which are required to the Bill. During debate in the Seanad, Senators Costello, O'Meara and Ryan listed 46 such amendments. However, those drafting amendments were not addressed because of the manner in which the Bill was dealt with in the Seanad. As a result, if we simply deal with the Seanad amendment before the House, and if it is accepted, we will pass a Bill with an inaccurate collective citation and Title.</P>
    <P>In the case of one of the 46 drafting amendments to which I referred, a constitutional difficulty could arise due to an anomaly in which, for example, if a constituency was otherwise uncontested a candidate would be deemed elected even though he or she was only 20 years, 11 months and two weeks old when his or her nomination was submitted. Such a candidate would be deemed elected even though he or she was under 21 years of age which is at variance with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister should agree to recommit the Bill to committee to deal with these and other matters.</P>

      <P>I have allowed the Deputy to make his point. We are dealing with an amendment from the Seanad. This procedure is covered by Standing Order 57 which is very specific. It states:</P>
      <P>An amendment made by the Seanad to a Bill initiated in the Dáil may be accepted by the Dáil with or without amendment or be rejected. No amendment shall be moved to an amendment made by the Seanad that is not strictly relevant thereto, nor can any other amendment be moved to the Bill unless it be consequential upon the acceptance, amendment or rejection of a Seanad amendment.</P>

      <P>The question before the House is that the Seanad amendment be agreed to. The amendment deletes section 59 of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000. The amendment to include section 59 was brought forward by the Government and passed in this House in response to an amendment tabled on Committee Stage by the main Opposition party and supported by the Labour Party spokesman. It provided for the prohibition of the taking and publication of an opinion poll in the seven day period prior to polling day or the publication of an opinion poll in the same period, which was taken prior to that period but not previously published. The prohibition was to apply to all polls, both public and private. There is no need to go into the <Col N="237" /> history of the matter. In its wisdom, the Seanad decided to delete that proposal with very little opposition from the parties opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put the Minister out of his misery by assuring him at the outset that I will not oppose the amendment. However, I cannot help hoping Deputy Gilmore is correct in asserting that the legislation is flawed. I oppose the main thrust of the Bill. It did not set out to enable electronic voting or make minor changes in our electoral system, but rather to increase &ndash; in the case of Fianna Fáil by 50% &ndash; the level of spending available to political parties and to legislate for corporate donations. Of course, I am not allowed to raise that topic today. Nevertheless I will not oppose the amendment.</P>
      <P>I regret the Seanad tabled the amendment and that it was not possible to hold a rational debate on the subject of opinion polls, which I and most right thinking people consider to be a reasonable expectation. There are very few civilised countries in which such a debate has not taken place.</P>
      <P>I recognise the reason the amendment was withdrawn, although I do not agree with all the arguments made for so doing. I do not believe the Minister's statement that the main reason the Government accepted the amendment was the loss of consensus. Legislation has been passed without consensus before. Neither did the problem lie with the drafting, despite the considerable publicity it received at the time and the fact that the drafting was flawed. The proposal was withdrawn largely because the public in general and the media in particular felt it was being pushed through, which is true in a sense because the whole Bill was pushed through at the last minute before the summer recess.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, because the matter was not raised until the very end of Committee Stage, there was no time to debate it. All Stages were, I believe, concentrated into two weeks leaving no time for temperate and reasoned debate about opinion polls. While opinion polls alternately cause us despair or delight, we all value them nonetheless. I want to debate the value of and possible damage caused by opinion polls in the immediate run-up to an election, particularly a general election.</P>
      <P>I regret we did not have time to debate the matter rationally to allow us draw conclusions from events of the past or experiences in other countries. I am aware it is impossible to draw definite conclusions because one can never objectively measure the impact of information or opinion. However, there is anecdotal evidence that opinion polls influence elections. In the case of the British general election, the media reported that the opinion poll before the election encouraged voters not to vote. That is probably the most worrying aspect of opinion poll outcomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue warrants a debate. I accept it is a sensitive question which requires striking a balance between our entitlement to information and our <Col N="238" /> right to cast our vote without undue influence being brought to bear. In the last few days before an election an opinion poll is more formative than informative. If we value our democracy, view our individual vote as sacrosanct and regard the outcome of an election as the sum of individual votes rather than the expression of collective opinion, we should worry about the effect of opinion polls in the final days before an election and debate the matter in a rational and considered way. We will revisit the issue. I will not oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first opportunity to do so, I welcome the Minister back to active service. This Bill and the amendment we are addressing arose prior to the summer recess when the Government succeeded in rushing a large amount of legislation through the House. It was most anxious to get this Bill through the House because it provides for increased spending limits for the next general election and retains, albeit in a reduced form, the corporate donations which my party had sought to have completely banned.</P>
      <P>When we last considered this legislation before the summer it was speculated that the Taoiseach might take the opportunity of the summer recess to dissolve the Dáil and call a general election. Tabling the amendment required that the Bill be brought back to this House for consideration. In so doing the Seanad guaranteed the House would reconvene after the summer recess because the only legislation in its entire programme the Government wants enacted before the next election is not legislation dealing with taxation or social welfare or any of the matters that concern the public, but legislation that will make it easier for itself to get re-elected. This legislation provides for the increased spending limits which will disproportionately benefit the Fianna Fáil party and provides for the continuation, albeit in a limited form, of corporate funding mainly of the Fianna Fáil party.</P>
      <P>It was the rush to get that legislation enacted which gave rise to the set of circumstances that has us re-examining it today. In the Government's rush to get the legislation through the House it would not consider any reasonable amendment from this side of the House on this issue; it would not consider the arguments being made, that we should not rush the fences on the provision dealing with opinion polls.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was on Report Stage, I proposed a motion that this provision in it should be recommitted to Committee Stage. I argued that the time which was then allowed on Report Stage &ndash; and it was a guillotine debate, as I recall &ndash; did not permit us to examine in the kind of detail required an amendment which had been circulated only that morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It introduced quite an amount of new material which had not been considered on Committee Stage. This material included the prescribing of new offences in this legislation. The legislation generally provided for offences and fines and <Col N="239" /> penalties but this amendment provided for new penalties and new offences and this House was given no real opportunity of considering and debating that amendment in detail. I argued on Report Stage and proposed that this should have been recommitted to committee and properly examined.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Olivia Mitchell mentioned, the question of when or if opinion polls should be taken in advance of a general election should be discussed in a reasonable way, in a way free of the kind of excitement which was generated, largely because of the Government's attempt to rush the legislation through. The Government would not hear of that proposal &ndash; it rejected it. We now see the result of that rejection; the Seanad found that this provision was seriously flawed and the Government was forced to reverse engines and come back to this House to seek to have it removed.</P>
    <P>I predict that the matters which I raised here earlier with the Leas Cheann Comhairle by way of a point of order are matters that we will be forced to re-visit because of the flaws in this bad Bill. I will not oppose the deletion of this section from the Bill because that deletion is perfectly consistent with the view which I took on Report Stage that this issue should be recommitted to committee anyway for proper consideration.</P>
    <P>I wish that instead of deleting one section of this Bill we rejected this Bill altogether. That option is not open to us this evening because, as I understand the Standing Orders of the House, the acceptance of the amendment from the Seanad will result in the Bill being deemed passed. The Bill in its totality is bad legislation, it is technically flawed and some aspects of it may be unconstitutional. It is giving an unfair electoral advantage to the largest political party in the State by way of the amount of money which can be spent at a general election. It has been introduced for that purpose primarily; it has been introduced to assist the main Government party in its efforts to be re-elected to Government. As such, it is profoundly undemocratic.</P>
    <P>It is an issue that will need to be taken to the people and debated whenever this Government decides to give up the pretence that it can effectively govern any longer and take itself to the people for their verdict on its lamentable performance. I regret this Bill is not being rejected in its entirety. Because of the issues which I raised earlier I have good reason to believe that many aspects of this legislation may end up being contested elsewhere.</P>

In such cases, where the Controller submits a written statement in lieu of appearing in person, that statement shall be admitted as evidence in the proceedings. The amendment proposed by Deputy Rabbitte seeks the addition of the text &ldquo;unless objection is taken thereto by a party to the proceedings&rdquo; to the end of section 33(5). The addition of this text would effectively mean that the written statement provided by the Controller would not be deemed to form part of the evidence in proceedings where any party to the proceedings objects and that, in these cases, the Controller would be obliged to be present and speak at these proceedings.</P>
      <P>I have considered further Deputy Rabbitte's comments on this matter since the debate during Committee Stage. I remain of the view that, for practical reasons, there should be no obligation on the controller to appear before the High Court in every proceeding relating to rectification of the designs register. The provision of a written statement of evidence signed by the Controller should be more than sufficient in the vast majority of cases. The current text of section 33(5) gives the High Court the power to direct the Controller to appear and be heard if it so wishes, despite the provision of such statements. This, in effect, means that any party to the proceedings can make an application to the High Court requesting the presence of the Controller at proceedings and the High Court will grant this request if it considers it appropriate.</P>
      <P>I suggest that Deputy Rabbitte's concerns are accommodated on the basis that the High Court has the power to direct the Controller to appear. I ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I see the import of the amendment now. The concern expressed by Deputy <Col N="241" /> Rabbitte, giving rise to the amendment, is that the statement shall be deemed to form part of the evidence. In other words, the statement could be taken as evidence without the opportunity being given to an offending party, or to the other side, to cross-examine. In his reply, the Minister of State said that the High Court may order the Controller to be present. The Controller would have to be present in a High Court action, particularly where the court will make a direction. I heard what the Minister of State said but, if he will not accept the amendment, it is important that, at least, the law would recognise that the production of a written statement, however certified that statement might be, might not be sufficient, in certain circumstances, without the opportunity to ask questions and conduct a thorough oral examination. I am concerned but, having regard to what the Minister of State said, if he will give an assurance that this point will not arise, that oral evidence may be adduced in cases, I will not press the matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The design right shall not apply to the use of a component part of a complex product for the purpose of repair of that product so as to restore its original appearance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During Committee Stage, I indicated that I had referred a proposal to the Office of the Attorney General for legal clearance to amend this Bill to facilitate liberalisation of the spare parts market in the law. Time constraints prevented the office of the Attorney General from providing drafting and legal clearance for a text to give effect to this proposal in time for a suitable amendment to be brought forward on Committee Stage. Since then, I have received confirmation from the Office of the Attorney General that the amendment I am now proposing to section 42 is in order.</P>
      <P>Section 14 implements the provisions of Article 3.3 of the directive in respect of spare parts in general. There is then the matter of how we choose to treat spare parts when they are used for repair purposes in the new legislation. The provisions of section 14(1) would, if left unqualified, operate to protect spare parts when they are used for repair purposes. This would mean that manufacturers of, for example, motor cars, electrical goods such as fridges, washing machines, cookers etc., and a host of other consumer durables, would be empowered in the law to prevent smaller independent spare parts manufacturers from making and selling replacement parts for their products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in committee, the existing Irish law on the protection of industrial designs is primarily set out in the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Acts 1927 to 1958. There is some reference to designs in copyright <Col N="242" /> law but it is not worth mentioning in the context of the use of spare parts for repair purposes. The 1927 Act contains a definition of &ldquo;design&rdquo; that does not explicitly exclude spare parts, whether or not they are used for repair, from the protection afforded by the Act. It excludes from the definition such designs as are &ldquo;mere mechanical devices&rdquo; or those that do not have aesthetic appeal. The only conclusion that can reasonably be drawn from an examination of the existing law, therefore, is that spare parts, including when used for repair purposes, are potentially capable of being protected under the current Irish law, where they meet the criteria set down in the 1927 Act. However, this matter is very unclear and results in an unacceptable level of uncertainty in Irish design law. We have now been presented, by virtue of the EU directive, with an opportunity to tidy up Irish law in this area and provide much needed clarity in the law.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, there is a significant spare parts industry spread across all industrial sectors in Ireland and in Europe. In the motor car sector, there are many businesses currently involved in producing replacement parts such as car doors, car wings, mirrors and upholstery, to name but a few, active in the Irish market. Ireland does not have a significant primary vehicle manufacturing sector and, therefore, legislation to prevent the production by independent companies of replacement parts for cars would not operate in favour of Irish industry. Neither would it operate in the interests of Irish consumers, given that monopoly rights tend to produce pricing structures which do not operate generally in the favour of consumers.</P>
    <P>My proposed amendment, which will have the effect of liberalising the market for spare parts production, is therefore in Ireland's strategic interests and in the interests of small and medium sized enterprises in Europe but, most of all, in the interests of consumers. We debated this at some length on Committee Stage and, as I recollect, Deputies Flanagan and Rabbitte welcomed this approach. Having clarified our objective, particularly from a consumer point of view, I ask the House to support the amendment.</P>

In a sense, we are giving the spare parts industry a boost. In relation to car parts, while we cannot, under design law, allow a person to simply copy a car, we can liberalise the regime in relation to spare parts. The car is really the best example of that.</P>

      <P>Section 62(4) provides that a witness giving hearsay evidence to the effect that infringing  material may be found in a particular location shall not be obliged to indicate the source for that information. This provision protects the identity of those persons who supply information to design right owners as to where infringing products or articles are to be found. Such protection would be necessary in cases, for example, where an employee informs the registered proprietor of a design that his or her employer is infringing the design right in that design or in cases where an informant might fear reprisals. It also permits persons close to a piracy operation to report such activity to the authorities, without fear of being identified. In many cases, piracy operations are run by organised criminals who would not be unknown to take reprisals against an informant if they knew that person's name and address. It is considered that the provision will encourage people to assist in countering design rights infringement &ndash; an identical provision to the current text, as passed by the Oireachtas, as section 132(4) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, in respect of copyright work.</P>
      <P>As agreed on Committee Stage, I looked again at the amendment put forward by Deputy</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rabbitte regarding section 62(4) and I remain of the view that the proposed amendment does not add anything to the effect or the intention of this subsection as it stands. It may complicate matters for witnesses and deponents seeking to give evidence revealing the illegal activity in question by forcing them to reveal their informant's identity where the information was not necessarily given in confidence. This could involve the identification of a company's systems for monitoring its intellectual property rights and reveal the mechanisms employed in enforcing intellectual property rights, thus enabling infringements to remain one step ahead of detection. In any case, the call as to whether an informant's identity would be revealed by virtue giving evidence could be a difficult one to make for an ordinary person who is not legally qualified and even for the legal profession itself. If even one such call was made in <Col N="244" /> error and resulted in a breach of that confidentiality, it is likely that this provision would not ever be trusted again and would be rendered useless.</P>
    <P>As a result of these complications, it is better to have a broad unambiguous clause to protect the identity of all informants in this highly sensitive area and other provisions of the Bill allow abuses of this provision to be dealt with through the award of damages. For those reasons, I cannot accept the proposed amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed note. I apologise to the House for being late; Dublin traffic accounts for it. Having heard the Minister's note, the main point with which I am concerned is that if I was to give the analogy of a District Court in a similar situation, I think it is protected by something along the lines that a garda may give evidence to the effect that his informant is a confidential source and it is taken as such. The point was that this provision should not apply unless it was to protect a confidential informant because it goes too far as it stands. If it resulted in divulging the identity of a confidential informant, obviously, that would not be acceptable. I take it from the detailed note the Minister put on the record that he is not minded to accede to it at this stage but I would like to hear from him again.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 30, to delete lines 36 and 37, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) the person had no reasonable grounds for such seizure.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 relates to section 62. As it stands, the test is very high, which is, effectively, to prove malice in terms of applications to the District Court for seizure of infringing articles or products. Section 62(5)(<i>b</i>) states: &ldquo;the information on which the registered proprietor applied for the order was given maliciously.&rdquo; I seek to insert an alternative which would read: <Col N="245" />&ldquo;the person had no reasonable grounds for such seizure.&rdquo; In all the circumstances, it softens the test a bit and it is more reasonable. Malice is very difficult to prove.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that we had this same discussion on the Copyright and Related Rights Act. He ultimately ended up accepting a similar amendment from me, or else he drafted his own version of it. My note refers to section 133(12)(<i>b</i>) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, which at least started life as an amendment by me. Either the Minister accepted it as we progressed through the Act or else he drafted his own &ndash; I cannot recall which. Again, the issue is the same &ndash; the test was malice. It would be far more reasonable in all the circumstances if the hurdle was reduced somewhat and the test was &ldquo;no reasonable grounds for such seizure&rdquo; because malice is very hard to prove. It is a very high test and I have some concerns about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very important distinction here. The Deputy referred to the copyright legislation. In relation to copyright, we were talking about section 133(12), as he rightly said, and that dealt with where the person was involved in a direct seizure. This relates to section 132(5) if we look at the parallel situation in copyright where there is an application to the court for an order to search for and seize goods. I will take the Deputy through this again because we had some debate on it on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Section 62(5) is concerned with those persons who are aggrieved by an order made by the District Court for the seizure of infringing products or articles. It provides that following the implementation of the order on the application of a person aggrieved by it, the court may award damages against the applicant for the order as it considers just where it is satisfied that no infringement of design right has been established and the information on which the design right owner applied for the order was given maliciously. In effect, a person who is wrongfully accused of the infringement of a design right has recourse to damages against the applicant where there is no infringement and the information was maliciously supplied. It is designed to discourage and prevent false accusations of piracy that may be purposely made in order to destroy a competitor's business or his or her reputation.</P>
      <P>I have examined further the amendment resubmitted by Deputy Rabbitte in regard to subsection (5). The proposed amendment seeks to lower the thresholds set in the existing text to provide that damages may be payable where it is shown simply that the person reporting suspected infringing activity had no reasonable grounds for the seizure. It removes the need to prove that there was malicious intent in the reporting. This has the effect of exposing people who, in their own judgment and belief, are of the view that illegal activity is occurring to an award of damages against them even though they were acting in good faith and in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> The current text, which is aligned with that of section 132(5) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, provides the possibility of rightful damages awards in cases of malicious reporting while not punishing good faith reporting by financial penalties. On Committee Stage Deputy Rabbitte referred to an amendment to section 133(12) of the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, along the lines of this proposed amendment, which was accepted by me during the passage of that Bill through the Dáil. That section was concerned with copyright owners entering and seizing illegal goods without making an application to the District Court. There is, therefore, a clear difference.</P>
    <P>In the case of section 62 of the Industrial Designs Bill, an application must be made to the High Court in the first instance under subsection (1), upon which the District Court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that infringing products are being sold etc., prior to making an order for search and seizure. This is sufficient to address any concerns about the threshold test for damages in this case. Section 62 is the equivalent of section 132 of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, which was the subject of similar amendments from the Deputy which were rejected by the House on that occasion also. On that basis I cannot accept the proposed amendment. I hope I have clarified the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main planks of my argument was that it seems desirable that both codes ought to be similar.

However, I accept the Minister of State's rebuttal of that argument.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 37, line 23, to delete &ldquo;is in force&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;has been confirmed by the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to section 73 of the Bill, which has to do with infringing products being treated as prohibited goods. It relates back to section 73(1) which provides that the registered proprietor of a design may give notice in writing to the Revenue Commissioners that he or she is the registered owner and that under subsection (f2&gt;b) he or she requests the Revenue Commissioners for a period specified in the notice to treat infringing products or infringing articles as prohibited goods. Section 73(4) states that provided the procedure in subsection (1) is adhered to and is in force &ndash; in other words, has legal effect &ndash; the importation of the goods etc. is prohibited. Whether it is adequate just to give such notice in writing and that once it is complied with it is taken to have legal effect, I seek to substitute <Col N="247" /> the words &ldquo;in force&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;has been confirmed by the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo; I do not think that is an unreasonable test. We are talking here about the wing of the Revenue Commissioners which deals with customs and excise and the importation dimension. It is, therefore, fair to give the Revenue Commissioners some role in deciding whether to accept such a notice. It is not right that the customs law of the State can be set aside unilaterally or modified or altered in any fashion by a private entity. What can be the objection to requiring the Revenue Commissioners to state that it is so? It seems a reasonable check, given the general balance of the Bill. Given that the whole purpose of the section is to provide for the prohibition of the importation of infringing products, it seems a reasonable balance to require the Revenue Commissioners to state that they are satisfied that what it says is true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of section 73 is simply to make it possible for a design right owner to give notice to the Revenue Commissioners in writing that he or she is the registered proprietor of a design and requesting them to prohibit the importation of infringing products or articles for a specified period, which may not exceed five years and which may not extend beyond the period for which design rights subsist. This provision is a general prohibition provision which would apply at the time of importation, but would also apply subsequently and enable the Revenue Commissioners or Customs and Excise to impound infringing products or articles found anywhere in the country during the specified period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsection at issue, subsection (4), provides that when such a notice is in force third parties will not be entitled to import goods to which the notice relates except where the use is intended for private and domestic purposes. The amendment resubmitted by Deputy Rabbitte seeks the deletion of the wording &ldquo;is in force&rdquo; in line 1 of subsection (4) and its substitution with the wording &ldquo;has been confirmed by the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo; I reiterate that the wording &ldquo;is in force&rdquo; has been used with the purpose of taking into consideration the intention of subsection (2) which clarifies that the period for which the notice is to be in force shall not exceed five years and shall not extend beyond the period for which the design right is to subsist. To simply receive confirmation from the Revenue Commissioners that a notice has been given would not adequately implement the intention of subsection (2) as it would make it possible for notices under this section to be effective beyond the maximum period specified in that subsection. The subsection limits the effective period of the prohibition of importation. The Deputy's amendment would effectively remove, unintentionally, that limitation and prevent importation forever. The key point is that the subsection with which we are <Col N="248" /> dealing is linked to subsection (2) in relation to time limits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has made a reasonable point. The words &ldquo;is in force&rdquo; are somewhat unusual in legislation. I would press the Minister of State on what exactly is meant by &ldquo;is in force&rdquo; in this case. Does it mean having been received by the Revenue Commissioners, having been served on the Revenue Commissioners, having been confirmed by the Revenue Commissioners? It appears that a notice could be lodged somewhere and might not be given due consideration, might not even be subject to rigorous inspection, and yet be in force. The point Deputy Rabbitte makes is that at least there should be confirmation that the notice has been served, that it has been received, that such receipt has been accepted, and that this activates the process of the notice having the force of law. Perhaps it is a small point, but it is important that the Minister of State be clear as to the precise point when a notice is in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the arguments advanced by Deputy Flanagan. I still do not understand, despite the Minister of State's comments, how the point is unreasonable. The Minister of State is tying his rejection of the amendment to subsection (2). I am at a loss to understand the reason the amendment invalidates that subsection as that is not its intention. I do not understand how the time limitation would be affected by excising the words &ldquo;is in force&rdquo; and replacing them with &ldquo;has been confirmed by the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister of State deals elsewhere in the Bill with false or mischievous assertions. What is preventing anybody exercising the right conferred by section 73 wrongly or falsely? Once the person makes application to the Revenue Commissioners in writing, it is taken at face value. A number of matters derive from this. The one that is the focus of this discussion is subsection (4) which uses the somewhat unusual choice of words &ldquo;is in force&rdquo;. I cannot see how the time limitation envisaged in subsection (2) would be damaged if the Revenue Commissioners were required to confirm that they had such a notice. I fail to make the connection. Perhaps it is straightforward; if so, the Minister of State might explain it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point is that the wording in the amendment would interfere with the substantive issue, which is that the notice is in force. The net effect is that it is illegal to import. The amendment seeks to delete the phrase &ldquo;is in force&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;has been confirmed by the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo; This is a crucial aspect of section 73 in that it refers to illegal importation. The words &ldquo;in force&rdquo; refer to the period of time specified in the notice by the rights order. This is the heart of the section and it is important that this language remains as it is. It provides the strength of the section and refers back to the per<Col N="249" /> iod specified, which is part and parcel of this type of intellectual property legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 40, to delete lines 29 to 34.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to excise the subsection. Under this subsection, which relates to costs, the controller has the power in any proceedings before him to levy costs. In so doing his judgment appears to be on a par with that of a judge of the High Court. I wonder about the fairness of this provision. It seems especially unfair because further in the Bill the reverse is not the case. The controller is never liable for costs. This is expressly provided for in section 83 which states: &ldquo;In proceedings before the courts under this Act, the Controller shall not be awarded costs and shall not be ordered to pay the costs of any other party.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If I am before the controller, he is allowed not only to make a quasi judicial decision on the matter before him, but he is also enabled, under this section, to levy costs against a party in the proceedings before him. When I go before the controller, therefore, I run the risk of him deciding against me, but he can also effectively fine me by way of this facility to raise costs. The controller, however, is protected against the reverse being the case. I am at a loss to understand the fairness or equity in the provision.</P>
      <P>The next amendment would remove the controller's discretion to order security for costs. Its effect would be to state that this should be a function of the High Court alone. The excision of the relevant words would leave it to the jurisdiction of the High Court to make that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 81 gives the controller the power to award costs and require a person to give security for costs. It also provides for the enforcement of an order for costs by leave of the High Court in the same manner as a court order. Subsection (1) empowers the controller to award any party to proceedings before him or her under this Bill such costs as he or she may consider reason<Col N="250" /> able and to direct how and by what party the costs are to be paid. It is a standard provision in intellectual property law concerning proceedings before the controller.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides that certain foreign based parties may be required by the controller or, in the case of an appeal, the High Court to give security for the costs of the proceedings. It is likely that an order will be made under this section prescribing that if a person neither resides nor carries on business in Ireland or another member state of the European Union, the controller may require him or her to give security for the costs of any application or appeal falling within the terms of this Bill. The intention here is to ensure that Irish based parties are not subjected to incurring onerous legal costs in protecting their rights in circumstances where an order for payment of their costs on success in legal proceedings would not be enforceable. The lodgment of security by persons in the State would, at the very least, provide access to some recompense, if not all costs, where the foreign party refused to meet an order for costs made by the Controller or the High Court.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) allows discretion to the Controller or the Court to treat the proceedings as abandoned where security for costs, under section 81(2) is not provided. This means that where a foreign party institutes proceedings against an Irish person in relation to an infringement of a design right under this Bill and subsequently fails to provide the required security for legal costs the Controller or the High Court may strike out these proceedings. It is intended to prevent nuisance cases being taken against legitimate Irish users of designs.</P>
      <P>The amendments put forward by Deputy Rabbitte seek to delete subsection 81(1) and to remove the references to the Controller in the other two subsections of the section. It is clearly the intention behind the amendments to take away any proposed role for the Controller in deciding costs in proceedings before him or her and in deciding on the issue of security for costs. These functions are currently allocated to the Controller in respect of patents proceedings in section 91 of the Patents Act, 1992, and in respect of trade marks proceedings in section 72 of the Trade Marks Act, 1996. I have not been made aware of any difficulties or particular problems with the operation of these provisions in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net effect of these amendments would be to have the High Court decide on all matters relating to costs in proceedings before the Controller. As pointed out during the debate on Commitee Stage, this would be a costly and possibly time consuming procedure for parties to hearings in the Patents Office to have to undertake. It would also be a backward step in the efficient operation of the adjudicatory procedures under intellectual property law. In any event, the Bill provides that any decision of the Controller, including decisions on costs, may be appealed to the High Court and, therefore, parties to pro<Col N="251" /> ceedings before the Controller are not being denied access to justice or to a full hearing before the courts in matters of costs.</P>
    <P>For these reasons and for reasons of consistency in the various areas of intellectual property law and procedures, I cannot accept these amendments.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Court is not adverted to in this section, as it stands. This is a serious deficiency because it allows the High Court to shut off an appeal on an important point, even though the Supreme Court might be willing to hear that appeal.</P>
      <P>The effect of my amendment would be to allow the Supreme Court to give leave to appeal. That facility is in our justice system because High Court judges sometimes make mistakes. Sometimes the Supreme Court can be appealed to in order to give this right of appeal and I do not see why it is denied here. I do not know if this point was consciously thought about or not. It may merely be worded in this way because we have been talking about the High Court until now. The Minister for Public Enterprise recently accepted two similar amendments in two Bills processed by her Department. I cannot see why we should shut off the prospect of an appeal to the Supreme Court. This Bill appears to be constructed on the assumption that any person coming before the courts in these circumstances is the wrong doer. There may be exceptional circumstances where the Supreme Court would take a different view from the High Court. I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's concerns will be met by the legislation. The purpose of section 84 is to make it clear that all decisions or orders made by the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks under this Act are capable of being appealed to the High Court. There are similar provisions in the Trade Marks Act, 1996, and the Patents Act 1992. Subsection 84(2) provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An appeal from any decision of the High Court under this section shall lie to the <Col N="252" /> Supreme Court on a specified point of law by leave of the High Court.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment proposed by Deputy Rabbitte would be that an appeal from a decision of the High Court under this section would lie to the Supreme Court on a specified point of law by leave of the High Court or the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>As I promised during the debate on Committee Stage, I referred Deputy Rabbitte's proposed amendment to section 84 to the office of the Attorney General. That office has confirmed that section 84 in its present form makes sufficient provision for the granting of leave to appeal to the Supreme Court since a High Court Order refusing leave would itself be capable of being appealed to the Supreme Court. The additional text proposed by Deputy Rabbitte is, therefore, redundant. There are similar provisions in other intellectual property legislation. The Deputy's concerns are met by this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to provide co-ordination of ministerial responsibility to improve services to western counties and notes that the section of the N5 from Ballaghderreen, County Roscommon/Strokestown, County Roscommon, the main commercial artery to the west, is not included in the national development plan and noting that the National Roads Authority does not propose to develop this section of the road until 2015, hereby resolves that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government uses his powers under section 41 of the Roads Act, 1993, to direct the Authority in writing to include this section of the N5 for immediate design and development and calls on the Government to clarify its proposals to provide for natural gas expansion in the region and for the provision of broadband technology throughout the western counties and resolves that a Cabinet sub-committee chaired by a Cabinet Minister from the west be set up, with specific responsibility for the delivery of services to the western counties.</P>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Deputies Naughten, Jim Higgins and Perry.</P>
      <P>I thank my Fine Gael colleagues for adopting this motion and the House for accepting it for discussion this evening. It is a simple and direct</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> motion that requires constructive Government action. It is geared towards creating a fairer Ireland and bridging the chasm of regional equality as regards access, infrastructure, communications and energy. Potential is defined in the Government consultation paper on the national spatial strategy as &ldquo;the capacity which an area possesses for development arising from its endowment of natural resources, population, labour, economic and social capital and location relative to markets&rdquo;. How can development be achieved in a region deprived of basic infrastructural necessities? It cannot.</P>
    <P>I accept the thoughts behind the mission statements of many Departments and I understand the aspirations contained in them. I am appalled by the Government's lack of direction towards implementation of the mission statements, however. I am appalled by the attitude of &ldquo;you do not matter over there&rdquo; and truly appalled by the notion that hail fellow, well met is an acceptable answer to the electorate of the west. We need Government led action. This motion shows how it can be done.</P>
    <P>Crusade for Survival, a report published in the Killala diocese in spring 2000, discussed sewage treatment in Belmullet. It reported that sewage was openly flowing into the bay, which is unhygenic and unacceptable for the people of the town and visitors to it. The arrival of dolphins to Belmullet Harbour last autumn attracted tourists, but the report stated that visitors were shocked by the smell of open sewage.</P>
    <P>The ESB needs to be upgraded in the west as there have been three power cuts since Christmas. Computers and fax machines have been destroyed. Machinery in local factories has been damaged by power surges, weather conditions and power cuts. Improvement of landline and mobile telephone coverage is also needed. Landlines are out of commission on a regular basis. Many blank spots disrupt the use of mobile telephones in Erris and in parishes in most western counties.</P>
    <P>A Cabinet sub-committee should be set up, chaired by a Cabinet Minister from a western county and comprising the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government, Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Health and Children, Education and Science, Public Enterprise and Tourism, Sport and Recreation. The sub-committee should be given authority by the Department of the Taoiseach to call each Minister of State for bi-monthly meetings to see if targets are achieved regarding the implementation of Government policy.</P>
    <P>There have been many confusing statements in the past six weeks about the discovery of natural gas. It is incredible that Ministers on the same benches have differing views about the find. When the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, replies to this debate, I would like him to say if a spur line from the Ballinaboy landing point of the Corrib gas terminal will go to Belmullet and if a <Col N="254" /> spur will go through Ballina and on to Sligo. These facilities have been promised. At a Fianna Fáil convention in Castlebar some time ago, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, said that if gas was wanted, gas would be supplied. I would like to hear his comments on the matter now.</P>
    <P>This motion deals specifically with the section of the N5 between Ballaghderreen and Strokestown, a distance of between 25 and 27 miles. It is not included in the national development plan and the National Roads Authority does not propose to develop it until after 2015 when most Deputies will be recipients of free travel allowances. The new sections of road between Westport and Castlebar and between Swinford and Carracastle are being designed and there is a delay in the design of the section near Ballaghderreen. There is no mention, however, of any authorisation for the improvement of the road between Ballaghderreen and Strokestown. The NRA has been given a specific remit for the design, construction and maintenance of roads. It is the ultimate bureaucratic quango of Government. A question cannot be asked about the NRA in this House as no answer will be received. If one writes to the NRA, one is lucky if the letter is acknowledged within six months. The authority is not subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
    <P>I wish to demonstrate why the NRA is the ultimate governmental, political, bureaucratic quango. The Minister, Deputy Fahey, represents a western constituency. Comments have been made about the development of a section of road over which £3 billion of multinational freight is ferried every year. The road is a glorified horse track. At the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis last Saturday, the Taoiseach said that our roads will be like the best roads in Germany. Yesterday we observed the gargantuan unveiling of the biggest road project in the history of this country, which will stretch for 110 km from Kilcullen to Waterford. The road will be 100 metres wide and will cost £500 million yet the poor business people of the west have to put up with a glorified cart track between Strokestown and Ballaghderreen.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran arranged a meeting with the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government some time ago. The chairman of the roads action committee said on Mid West Radio on 27 September that the Taoiseach was amazed, flabbergasted and concerned as he could not understand why a section of the N5 was left out of the programme. The Taoiseach said that the problem of the N5 must be solved. What will he do? Will he ask the NRA to carry out a feasibility study? Senator Finneran, who has strong aspirations to represent the people of Roscommon in this House, said that the Government has instructed the NRA to carry out a constraint study east of Ballaghderreen immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Fahey, was asked a straight question on Mid West Radio on 28 August. He was asked if it is true that the Mini<Col N="255" /> ster for the Environment and Local Government has power over the National Roads Authority. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources replied that it is absolutely not true. He said that the NRA is an independent agency that is given a budget and allowed to decide on priorities. The role of the Government, Deputy Fahey said, is to convince the NRA of priorities, but it cannot direct the authority. I asked the Minister for the Environment and Local Government last week in a parliamentary question if he has authority under section 41 of the Roads Act, 1993, to direct the NRA, if the NRA must comply with such a direction and if such a direction has ever been given. The Minister gave a clear reply to which every Fianna Fáil and Independent Deputy should listen:</P>
    <P>The Roads Act, 1993, assigns overall responsibility to the National Roads Authority (NRA) for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads. Section 41 of the Roads Act, 1993, confers power on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to give a direction in writing to the NRA in relation to any of the functions assigned to it. The NRA must comply with any such direction. To date, no directions have issued to the NRA under this provision.</P>
    <P>How will we have roads similar to those in Germany if no direction is given by a Minister who has authority over this quango and another Minister with assumed powers for the west does not understand the legislation over which his colleague has authority? It is ridiculous and ludicrous that £3.5 billion worth of freight comes up every year on that road, which, as I said, is a glorified horse track, but the Government will not issue a directive under its legislative powers.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, said on 12 June 2001 at the launch of the CLÁR programme for the regeneration of rural Ireland:</P>
    <P>I hope we are now at the turning of the corner. The Celtic tiger itself, without such a positive discrimination if we can call it that, will not solve the problem and Government at last has come to realise that unless there is positive discrimination for these areas, we will not solve the problem despite your efforts and despite the efforts of local politicians.</P>
    <P>We need clarity and action from the Government. The Taoiseach finished his Ard-Fheis speech by telling the delegates to go back to their constituencies and finish the job they started. Perhaps he should have said that they cannot finish what they never started. I call on Deputies Blaney, Gildea and Healy-Rae and even Deputy Cooper-Flynn, who is no longer a member of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, to support the motion tomorrow night. When they walk up the steps they will either vote for the N5 or they will not do so. If they do not vote for it, woe betide them <Col N="256" /> if they stand on a public platform west of the Shannon in the next six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The national development plan, which is being progressively implemented, is designed to enable economic and social development and balanced regional development. However, the western region accounted for only 16% of total national employment between 1998 and 2000, mainly in Galway city and County Clare which accounted for 90% of the job gains while counties such as Roscommon suffered a net loss. The west's national share of IDA jobs has fallen from 22% in 1995 to 18.7% in 2000. In terms of jobs, the west is receiving crumbs that fall from the rich man's table. It is evident that the Government has no desire to improve infrastructure in the west and is pursuing a <i>laissez-faire</i> policy in relation to roads and other infrastructural developments.</P>
      <P>Cromwell once said: &ldquo;To hell or to Connacht.&rdquo;  However, it is now easier to get to hell than it is to get to Connacht. It is now easier to attract a chocolate factory to hell than to attract an IT company to the west. When the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was in Asia earlier this year she said Ireland had a First World economy with a Third World infrastructure. If the country as a whole has a Third World infrastructure, I do not know how the infrastructure of the west can be described. The lack of road access to the west is detrimental to industrial development and the development of tourism in the region. The viability of existing industry there is damaged by the additional costs currently involved.</P>
      <P>The most deplorable national primary route by far is the N5, which can only be described as a cart track. The most deplorable section is from Scramogue in County Roscommon to the Mayo border. The Cabinet had to travel along this cart track to get to Ballaghaderreen for its historic meeting, but it wants to continue to ignore the condition of the N5 until at least 2015. Industry in the west has no sea crossings or proper rail service. However, a key access route such as the N5 is in such a state of disrepair that the negligence is becoming malicious. There are eight national primary routes covering the west, but only one has been given dual carriageway status under the national development plan &ndash; so much for developing the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The N5 is in urgent need of upgrading. Business has continually pointed out the serious transport costs that arise because of the inadequate road quality, a road which serves as the main artery from counties Roscommon and Mayo to the east coast and the ports. There is also a large body of evidence that the poor quality of this road is a major deterrent to investment in the region. Given its peripherality, it is essential to develop a strategy for road infrastructure based on development and the needs of the region rather than existing traffic flows. The Government has the ability to ensure this happens by <Col N="257" /> using the powers under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1993. However, although the Taoiseach and Government members have given vague commitments, they are not prepared to act to ensure this directive is issued to the National Roads Authority. Without this directive, the road will never be upgraded because the NRA does not consider it a priority.</P>
    <P>Everybody, with the exception of the Minister for Public Enterprise, is conscious of the impending power and energy crisis. Gas supply could be part of a solution to the energy problem in the western region. However, the Government has not put a timeframe in place for the delivery of the proposed new gas network. It has merely announced that it will take place at some stage in the future. A date should be set and a distribution plan implemented immediately. While the Government continues to pander, promise and procrastinate, no business will enter the region. Ideally, it should be done in conjunction with other infrastructural works, such as the installation of fibre-optic cable.</P>
    <P>County Roscommon, which is the heart of the country, has been ignored in terms of the gas network as it has been ignored in the past. I propose that a major infrastructural corridor be established to include gas and fibre-optic cable from Athlone via Roscommon and Castlerea to Claremorris and the west coast, with spurs from the corridor serving towns such as Ballaghaderreen and Boyle. High speed telecommunications capability is essential in competing for e-commerce business on an international stage. Well developed broadband infrastructure across the country is essential to avoid the over-concentration of national investment in the Dublin region. E-commerce negates the historic disadvantage of the west in attracting investment and high quality employment for its people. This is a golden opportunity for the west. The new economy removes trade barriers, such as geographic location, and is ideal for the west. Unfortunately, the Government's failure to provide for Internet infrastructure is disproportionately affecting the west.</P>
    <P>In the context of telecommunications, Eircom has ignored the infrastructure and not put fibre-optic cable in place, although it is a basic infrastructural requirement for e-commerce. Eircom and the Government have ignored the issue. Eircom has stated that it has withdrawn its investment because it is unable to provide e-commerce infrastructure to the west. I call on the Government to give a firm commitment that financial resources will be provided for Eircom to immediately develop urgently needed broadband infrastructure in the west.</P>
    <P>These issues have been, and continue to be, ignored by the Government. It is not prepared to tackle the infrastructural deficit. It is only prepared to bury its head in the hand, throw a couple of million pounds in our direction and hope that will keep us quiet. I commend the motion to the <Col N="258" /> House and hope the Government, in its fifth year in office, will listen and do something about it.</P>

        <b>:</b> Yes. We, in the west, are fed up with being examined, parsed, analysed, dissected, studied and pitied. We do not want any more dissections, studies or pity. The west wants jobs, investment and infrastructure. The Developing the West Together initiative was commissioned by the western bishops and the document led to the creation of a Minister of State with direct responsibility for western development under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach. This, in turn, led to the establishment, on a statutory basis, of the Western Development Commission. However, when the Government took office almost five years ago, it relegated the Minister of State from being under the direct command of the Taoiseach to being a Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and appointed a Tipperary man to the post.</P>
      <P>The Western Regional Authority development plan and a document on Structural and Cohesion Funds 2000-2006 were published. They are lovely, shiny impressive documents full of facts, figures, statistics and aspirations. A development plan for the west for the period 2000-06 was also produced by the Western Development Commission. There has been study after study, document after document but none has been implemented because the Government has not made any commitment to the western region. In the meantime the west continues to haemorrhage its people. People emigrated for years to Britain, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia but nowadays the haemorrhage is to the eastern region, which choking to death. Dublin city is chaotic but people from the west move to Dublin because there are jobs to be had.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has referred to the regionalisation plans of the Government, the IDA and Forbairt which will mean the dispersal of jobs to the regions but that has not happened and, as Deputy Naughten said, the proof is in the figures that have been collated. The IDA created 13,800 new jobs in 2000, yet less than 10% &ndash; 1,246 &ndash; of those jobs were created in the seven western counties and of those half went to Galway city. If Galway city is excluded from the equation, the remaining 650 jobs were created in Counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and Clare while at the same time 2,200 jobs went to the wall and the slide continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment growth in the BMW region is a mere 7.5% compared to 14.7% in the bloated, choking and over burdened eastern region. The Western Development Commission's blueprint contained a very commendable target of 2,100 <Col N="259" /> jobs annually to be spread throughout the region creating an equilibrium between all the western counties. However, that has not been met because the commitment, infrastructure and investment are not there.</P>
    <P>Infrastructure has not been put in place. The motion refers to the N5 but there are other national primary routes in the region which are almost as bad. The N5 is the main artery to the heart of the region. One must make a tortuous journey of 26 miles along a road littered with wing mirrors, mudguards and broken bumpers. This road has been passed over time and time again in regard to funding for improvements. There is a continuous double white line on the road, as the Deputy said, from Ballaghaderreen to the River Shannon with cavalcades of tractors and lorries travelling along it at 30 miles per hour.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Commission's target has not been met because the rail infrastructure has not been upgraded. Old clapped out locomotives and antediluvian carriages, which regularly sit on the track, are used for services to the west. It is ironic that one can travel from Shannon to New York in five hours, yet a journey on Iarnród Éireann's service from Heuston Station to Westport on a Friday evening can take up to five and a half hours.</P>
    <P>Telecommunications services have not been provided. The national development plan contained a commendable commitment to the laying of fibre-optic cable in the west with a total investment of £17 million in a telecommunications plan. A sum of £13 million was to be provided by the EU but Eircom has walked away from this commitment. No telecommunications mean no jobs. The WDC's target has also not been met because electric power has not been made available. The electricity grid is so inadequate that no company could set up west of a line from Cavan to Galway. The area is deficient in terms of power and the long promised 110 kv cable has not been laid. It will take seven years to upgrade the grid. There are poor roads and rail services in the region while it also lacks electricity provision and adequate telecommunications.</P>
    <P>The announcement that gas had been found in the Corrib gas field off Achill Head created excitement and expectation in the west. The people believed that at last there was a significant energy source at their back door, yet an integrated plan or cohesive strategy has not been drawn up. No commitment has been given in terms of which towns will be connected to the gas network except for the odd whispered aside to the chairman of a county council at a function in Galway city and an announcement in<i> The Western People</i>. However, the Government has not put pen to paper.</P>
    <P>The region is dying and nothing tangible is happening. An entire province is ebbing its way into oblivion. The last great hope of the west was to retain Objective One status because that would have meant at long last the provision of a combi<Col N="260" /> nation of EU funds and national aid that would bridge the GDP, jobs and infrastructure gaps between the east and the west. Two years and nine months later nothing has happened. The resources have not flowed, the infrastructure has not been put in place and the money has not been invested.</P>
    <P>If Objective One was working we would not have tabled this motion. We have an obligation to do so because we were told Objective One status would create the necessary energy, impetus and development in the west and give the region the necessary lift. We were told in the past that a rising tide would lift all boats but we were left stuck in the mud.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kenny said the general election is around the corner and the moment of truth will be soon at hand. The people of the west are tired of being fed a diet of promises and aspirations, of being conned and of being told to wait because one day their day will come. The Celtic tiger has been good for Ireland but he never put his paw west of the Shannon. The only tiger we have seen over the past five years has been as a result of the annual visit of Fossett's Circus. This motion is about survival and it is not a circus or a joke. When the election is called the people of the west will speak very effectively with the ballot paper as only they know how.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for tabling this important motion. It has been almost two years since the Minister for Finance announced decentralisation plans for 10,000 public servants, the largest such exercise in the history of the State but not a single job has been moved from over crowded Dublin. As the national development plan &ndash; which I believe has been extended to 2010 or later &ndash; rumbles on we are still waiting for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to publish a spatial strategy outlining growth centres for the new millennium. Fine Gael has identified growth centres such as Sligo but it is like making a jigsaw without the pieces. Fine Gael is a party with conviction and has the backbone to name centres. The Minister has made a shambles of an announcement and his plan covers almost every DED in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such inadequate planning at Government level is reflected in the behaviour of its development agencies. In spite of official policy which is to discriminate in favour of less developed regions and communities the NRA, for example, is still planning roads in line with current economic development and projected traffic use. As a result motorways linking Dublin to Belfast, Galway, Limerick and Cork have been prioritised while national primary routes to Sligo and Castlebar in the north-west will be upgraded but not to the same extent. This is outrageous. Approximately £300 million less than originally anticipated has been allocated. Such an approach reinforces economic trends and does nothing to counter traditional imbalances between the regions. That cannot be allowed to continue. A dual carriageway to Sligo <Col N="261" /> is urgently needed and we are entitled to it. There is a similar attitude about the provision of high quality energy supplies and other forms of infrastructure. Will Sligo get gas from this field? I have heard a lot of waffle about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an example of live horse, get grass. I am glad the Minister is committed to it.</P>
      <P>There are strong inflationary pressures in the construction industry and demands on the Government from the European Commission to reduce the level of public spending under the national development plan. The Committee of Public Accounts was told that inflation on major construction projects, such as road building and housing, was running at 12.5%. At the same time, an estimated £250 million was switched out of capital spending projects during each of the past two years, and the west is suffering as a result. The outcome will inevitably lead to a further squeezing of structural investment in the underdeveloped regions.</P>
      <P>The economic and social pull of Dublin as a bloated centre of population will have a more pronounced effect on the Border and western regions unless countervailing action is taken. That is not happening. In the budget of 1999 the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced the decentralisation of 10,000 jobs as a means of reducing commuting and housing pressures in Dublin, while spreading State spending and jobs more equitably throughout the regions. However, apart from initiating a competition between rural towns for the location of Government agencies, nothing has happened. The urban renewal tax incentives were announced to great fanfare. However, the economy is slowing down. I heard a Revenue inspector say this morning that there is only £10 million out of £700 million left one month before the budget. That proves the economy is slowing down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kenny mentioned the fact that the Roads Act, 1993, assigns overall responsibility to the National Roads Authority for the planning and supervision of works for the construction and maintenance of national roads. I am delighted that clarification has been given in that regard. I attended several meetings where I was told the NRA was an autonomous body for which the Minister does not have responsibility. Section 41 of the Roads Act, 1993, confers power on the Minister with responsibility for local government to give direction in writing to the National Roads Authority in relation to any function assigned to it. It also states that the National Roads Authority must comply with any such direction. That information was included in a parliamentary <Col N="262" /> reply today. However, to date, directions have not issued to the NRA under this provision. Why is that the case? The Minister is the boss and he should carry the can.</P>
    <P>The development of the national primary road network should be based on an assessment of road needs resulting from predicted traffic growth which, in turn, is based on an assumption of a continuation of historic patterns of development. That is not happening in Sligo, Leitrim and the north-west. If we want to stimulate economic development the aim should be to ensure that all nodes are connected to one another by a road of dual carriageway standard. Priority in achieving this goal should be given to urban centres with the highest population. Why is the north-west excluded? </P>
    <P>As regards cross-Border development, there are no links to Sligo, Enniskillen, Castlebar or Derry. However, a city such as Dublin has four, while Belfast and Galway have two. How can the Minister account for that? I ask the Minister to instruct the National Roads Authority to upgrade the N4 to Sligo to dual carriageway standard. The Government has been strong on talk, but weak on action in terms of developing the north-west. I am privileged to serve the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was in Sligo last week where she announced 250 new jobs for Sligo in the high technology sector over the next five years. Thousands of jobs have been lost in that area in the past five months. She is not fooling anyone. Anyone who makes such an announcement is not living in the real world. Some 155 jobs were lost yesterday in Hansons factory in Sligo. The Minister's announcement is of no consolation to anyone. Transwear is an excellent company which employs 60 people at present. I salute it for its initiative. Given that the Minister does not know what will happen in the next five months in the high technology sector, how can she know what will happen in the next five years? </P>
    <P>The Minister has refused to carry out a feasibility study on the important link between Sligo, Limerick and Galway. This study would cost approximately £50,000. The role of private enterprise has been completely ignored by the Government. Business people have been the backbone of the success of this economy. However, bureaucracy is curtailing their development and it is outrageous.</P>
    <P>The Government is lost in ego-mania. It has a solid belief that it is entitled to power and that it will be here for a number of years. However, as Deputy Kenny said, the electorate will decide when the time comes. I speak on behalf of the constituents of Sligo-Leitrim and they will deliver a solid message to the Government. I will watch the boxes closely at the next election. Fine Gael will deliver the results in Sligo-Leitrim which will show the Government it did not give priority to <Col N="263" /> that constituency. I am disappointed I have to hit hard on this issue.</P>
    <P>Enterprise boards which look after small companies do not have funds. They have been given the task of looking after employers who employ between one and ten people. They have only £1.2 billion, most of which is spent on bureaucracy. Small companies have not been given assistance. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív, recently announced a scheme which is another red tape exercise. The time has come to support people who are creating jobs.</P>
    <P>There has not been any investment in the west. Fine Gael has committed itself to upgrade the N4 when it gets into office.</P>

There is a huge growth centre in the north-west. Why was it not prioritised as a growth centre by the Government? It has been identified by Fine Gael as a future growth centre and will act on that when it is returned to Government. I assure the Minister that will happen. This region will be developed and jobs will be created. Deputy Jim Higgins correctly stated that 150 jobs were created in Sligo by IDA Ireland in recent years. Some 150 jobs were lost in Sligo last week. The Government must face reality.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ndash;commends the Government's proactive approach to upgrading the country's infrastructure including in the western counties and welcomes:</P>
      <P>&ndash;the progressive implementation of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, which is designed to enable economic and social development and balanced regional development through:</P>
      <P>developing the potential of all regions to contribute to the maximum extent to continuing prosperity, and</P>
      <P>reducing the disparities between and within the Border, Midland and</P>
      <P>Western Region and the Southern and Eastern Region;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the increased investment in economic and social infrastructure since this Government took office, including the projected investment of some £26 billion (current prices) over the period 2000-2006 in roads, public transport, environmental infrastructure, energy, housing and health, as well as investment in higher and further education facilities;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the demonstrable progress being made in implementing the national roads development programme set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 which provides for major improvements to the N5 and other national routes serving the western counties;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the natural gas infrastructure developments in the west and north-west, specifically the Bord Gáis proposals to construct pipelines between Dublin, Galway and Limerick and between Mayo and Galway, and the Government's recent decision on extending the network to Ballina and Sligo from the Mayo-Galway pipeline and to Letterkenny by a cross-Border pipeline from the proposed Belfast-Derry pipeline;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" />&ndash;the effective contribution being made by the Cabinet Committees on Infrastructure and Public Private Partnerships and on Social Inclusion to the economic and social development of the west through better co-ordination of Government policy and integration at the point of delivery of a range of targeted programmes and services;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the on-going work of the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure and Public Private Partnerships in ensuring that all steps are taken to ensure the efficient and timely delivery of infrastructural projects throughout the country;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the CLÁR programme which will see rural areas of disadvantage, many of which are in the western counties, benefiting from prioritised investment, including under the National Development Plan 2000-2006;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the Government's commitment to finalise by end 2001, following a full process of public consultation, a national spatial strategy that will address the promotion of balanced regional development on a broader basis, with due regard to sustaining economic development, improving the quality of life, and maintaining and enhancing our national and cultural heritage; and </P>
    <P>&ndash;the retention of Objective One status for the Border, midlands and western region and the resultant higher levels of Structural Fund assistance and better State aids available for this region over the period to 2006.</P>
    <P>Ireland has benefited from unprecedented economic growth over the past number of years. In order to build on this progress and to prepare for future infrastructural needs, the Government's national development plan sets out an ambitious programme of works to be undertaken throughout the country. The plan recognises that while all regions of the country have benefited from our economic growth, the distribution of our economic progress has not been evenly spread throughout the regions. This was one of the most prominent elements that the Government considered as it prepared the NDP. The plan involves an investment of over £40 billion in 1999 prices over the seven year period from 2000 to 2006. It is the largest investment plan ever drawn up by this State and has four basic strategic objectives: continuing sustainable national economic and employment growth; consolidating and improving Ireland's international competitiveness; fostering balanced regional development, which is particularly relevant in the context of motions under discussion here; and promoting social inclusion.</P>
    <P>The needs of the Border, midlands and western region, which includes the western counties, have been well catered for in the NDP. It provides for a total investment of £13.5 billion at 1999 prices over the period 2000-06 in that region. This is equivalent to £14,000 per head of population compared to £10,000 in the southern and eastern <Col N="266" /> region. The NDP provides for the most significant investment in regional development in the State's history and will contribute significantly to the achievement of more balanced regional development.</P>
    <P>In view of the disparities in economic and social progress within the country, the Government also campaigned for and successfully negotiated with the EU for the designation of the country into these two regions &ndash; the southern and eastern region, and the Border, midlands and western region &ndash; despite the opposition and derision of most in the Fine Gael and Labour Parties at the time. This arrangement enabled Objective One status to be retained for the BMW region for the full period to 2006&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;while the southern and eastern region qualifies for a transitional regime for Objective One status until 2005. Against this background, it is sad to see that Fine Gael is so out of touch that it does not realise or wish to acknowledge what is being done for the western counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In contrast to the lip service and window dressing approach of Fine Gael to the issue of western development when it was last in Government, each member of this Government is focused on taking concrete action to ensure that the west can realise its full potential. We have a clear view of what we wish to do and we have put in place the policies, the institutional and other arrangements to achieve it.</P>
      <P>The improvement of infrastructure is a particular priority. There is broad agreement that our infrastructure has not kept pace with our economic growth and development, and that improved infrastructure is now the key issue for a higher quality of life and for national development. The Government, therefore, accorded a clear priority in the NDP to the acceleration of infrastructural programmes. More than half of total NDP expenditure is being devoted to economic and social infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The impact of this investment on the national roads network will be very visible in the western counties. The national road network in the region will be dramatically improved over the period through the up-grading of the N2 from Dublin to the Border, the N3 from Dublin to Cavan, the N4 from Dublin to Sligo, the N5 from Dublin to Westport &ndash; to which I will return in a moment &ndash; and the N6 from Dublin to Galway. Major improvement works on other national primary and secondary routes in the region will also take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National primary route projects with a total estimated value of approximately £2 billion, <Col N="267" /> including the N2, N3, N4, N5 and N6 routes serving the western counties, are currently in planning. Most of these projects are scheduled to be completed or under way by 2006.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The impact of investment in non-national roads in the West has been and will be very significant as well. The BMW region accounts for 40,514 kms, or 44.9% of the 90,303 kms of non-national roads. The NDP provides for investment of £848 million in this region in the 2000-06 period. This year over £131 million will be spent from State grants on non-national roads in the BMW region.</P>
      <P>Overall, the investment in national and non-national roads in the BMW region will contribute towards providing easier access to employment, training and social opportunities for the region's inhabitants and offer existing firms and potential investors better access to the national road network and, thus, to domestic and foreign markets.</P>
      <P>Before I proceed to deal specifically with the N5 route, I would like to contrast the commitment and record of this Government on infrastructural investment in some other sectors with that of the last Government. Under the NDP, almost £3 billion has been provided for water and waste water services, which is more than three times the outturn of £906 million under the previous NDP. Of the total expenditure, the BMW region will benefit from expenditure of almost £l billion up to 2006. The amount of capital expenditure incurred last year under the rural water programme amounted to £35.4 million and is expected to increase to over £70 million by 2003. This contrasts with just £8.5 million in 1996, the last year that the Deputy's party was in Government.</P>

The western region has shared in this increased investment in social housing. The capital allocation to the western counties in 2001 under the local authority housing programme amounted to just over £80 million compared with £30 million in 1997, an increase of 166%.</P>

      <P>Five routes were specifically identified in the NDP for upgrading to motorway or high quality dual carriageway standard along their entire length &ndash; the N1, N6, N7, N8 and N9. The NDP also provided that major improvements will be carried out on the main routes serving the west and north-west including the N2, N3, N4 and N5. The NRA, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities, is now pursuing the detailed programming of the work involved and will decide the precise road type to be provided in that context based on the National Road Needs Study, 1998, and current and projected traffic growth.</P>
      <P>In relation to the N5, the current position is that major improvement projects estimated to cost £120 million are in the course of planning. Subject to progress in planning, these projects are expected to reach construction in the period to 2006. This year, an allocation of £8.323 million has been made by the NRA to various local authorities in relation to improvement, planning and design work on the N5.</P>
      <P>While it is a matter for the NRA, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities, to undertake the detailed programming of the N5 improvement works, it would be useful if I outlined for the House the main activities which the NRA has indicated it is pursuing this year on the route.

Rehabilitation works are being planned or carried out on sections of the N5 at the Mayo end and west of Strokestown that were damaged during last winter.</P>
      <P>Roscommon County Council is preparing a constraints study for the whole N5 route.

      <P>&mdash;and it has devoted considerable attention to the national roads programme and to western routes in particular. It has also considered issues concerning energy and telecommunications infrastructure in the west. These issues will be dealt with by the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, with whom I am sharing time. The cross-departmental team of officials supporting the committee recently met the Western Development Commission and representatives of the chambers of commerce in the west and north-west to discuss their proposals regarding transport, energy and telecommunications infrastructure in the region.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion has been actively involved in the development of the CLÁR programme which was launched by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ó Cuív, on 5 October. The programme provides a framework for intensive, targeted intervention to tackle the problem of depopulation, decline and lack of services in rural areas of severe disadvantage mainly in the west and midlands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the N5 specifically, and notwithstanding the improvements that are in progress, in planning or under way, the Cabinet committee on infrastructure agreed, following a presentation by the NRA in July 2001, that a more detailed assessment of the N5 was necessary. This is now being undertaken by the NRA and will afford a further opportunity to assess the needs of the N5 and to take all relevant factors into account. The NRA is due to report to the Cabinet committee before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another major plank in the Government's pursuit of more balanced regional development is the national spatial strategy. The strategy will form the central thrust of Government policy to achieve more balanced regional development. Substantial progress has been made with the development of the spatial strategy. A consultation paper entitled Indications for the Way Ahead, which was recently published by my Department, focuses on spatial opportunities and choices for different areas and the policies and actions which might flow from these. The publi<Col N="271" /> cation of this document is being followed by an intensive period of consultation with social partners, regional and local interests, local groups and the general public. Drafting of the strategy will then commence with a view to its submission to the Government by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>What all this amounts to is that the Government, unlike the main Opposition party, is taking a logical and sensible approach to the development of the west in general and the improvement of the N5 in particular.</P>

      <P>The Government has not shut the door on further or more elaborate improvements if these can be justified objectively in terms of future traffic demands or broader regional needs.

      <P>This is poor parliamentary manners, but perhaps the Deputies still have a bit to learn. The situation, therefore, will be kept under review and plans will be adapted as required. The House will understand, therefore, that it is neither necessary nor appropriate for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to consider using his powers under section 41 of the Roads Act, 1993, to direct the NRA as regards road improvements on the N5 as advocated by the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the day, the Government will ensure that the N5 is designed and improved to a standard that will meet the needs of users. Equally, the Government will continue to take all necessary steps to ensure the timely and effective delivery of all infrastructural investment planned <Col N="272" /> for the west to ensure that it will share equitably in the economic and social progress of the country as a whole. In this way, I am confident that the ambitious objectives set out in the NDP can be met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to outline to the House the significant developments that are taking place in the west and north-west regarding the extension of the natural gas network.</P>
      <P>Although there is no provision in the national development plan for the construction of gas pipelines, Bord Gáis Éireann is planning to spend in the region of 254 million in the BMW region over the next two years on the Dublin-Galway-Limerick ring main and the Mayo-Galway pipeline. In addition, the Government recently decided to move forward with the next stage of extending gas to the north-west.</P>
      <P>Over the past 21 years the gas network has grown progressively since the first gas came to Cork in 1978. The building of the ring main pipeline and the advent of Corrib gas has now changed the focus and pace of development of the gas network. An environmental impact statement for the Dublin-Galway-Limerick ring main has been submitted to me by BGE. This has been appraised by independent consultants who have confirmed that it meets all statutory requirements and will not have significant environmental effects in the long term.</P>
      <P>I convened an oral hearing on 24 September 2001 to inquire into BGE's application to construct this pipeline and its associated applications for acquisition orders. This hearing has concluded and I am awaiting the independent inspectors' report and recommendations. I expect to receive these within a matter of weeks. BGE has a scheduled completion date of October 2002 for this pipeline.</P>
      <P>Independent consultants have also concluded an evaluation of the EIS for the Mayo-Galway pipeline, which will bring Corrib gas to the network. The consultants have indicated that it also meets all statutory requirements and will have no significant effect on the environment in the long-term.</P>
      <P>The public consultation process on this pipeline, which is separate from the planning process,</P>
      <P>is under way and will run until 29 October 2001. In the event of objections being received, I may decide to hold an oral hearing. BGE has a scheduled completion date of August 2003 for this pipeline and has signalled that Castlebar, Claremorris, Tuam and Athenry are likely to be connected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year the Government decided, in principle, to extend the natural gas network to the north-west. Having considered the issue, the Government has now decided to move ahead with the next step in this project. BGE has been asked to conduct a detailed planning exercise on the extension of the network to Sligo, via Ballina <Col N="273" /> from the proposed Mayo-Galway pipeline, and to Letterkenny via a cross-Border pipeline from Derry, which is to be served by a pipeline from Belfast, planned by the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
    <P>Preliminary analysis carried out for BGE has confirmed that these extensions would not be viable on the basis of anticipated gas demand and that considerable grant aid would be required. The level of grant aid depends on the balance between the capital and operating costs of the extension and the estimated gas demand in the new area being served. The Government has taken a broad view of these projects, and given the wider regional and socio-economic benefits of improving the energy infrastructure, has decided to proceed with the next stage of the project. Detailed engineering and planning for the project will define the pipeline extensions in greater detail and identify the level of funding which would be required. I understand this phase of the project will take about six months to complete, following which the issue of grant aid will be considered again by Government, provided that the necessary clearance has been obtained from the European Commission. It would then take about two further years to complete the pipelines.</P>
    <P>At the same time as the detailed planning is being carried out, a State aid case will be submitted to the EU Commission for approval of grant aid. We want to do these works in parallel to avoid any undue delay. This is an infrastructure project which, when constructed, will be available to all gas suppliers and will enlarge the total customer base for the liberalised gas market.</P>
    <P>In recent years broadband communications networks have become an important piece of enabling economic infrastructure. The importance of broadband is based on the emergence of Internet and e-mail as key business tools. Broadband was a phrase seldom used ten years ago. In the last decade the rapid growth of these electronic media in business and personal use has sparked a demand for telecommunications networks that support high speeds and quantities of data exchange.</P>
    <P>This demand has seen major constructions and developments in telecommunications networks in large urban centres throughout the world. In Ireland we are also bringing this broadband connectivity to regional and low population-density areas. Whether it is with fibre-optic cable, co-axial cable, across copper wire or through wireless media, the Government is committed to working in partnership with telecommunications service providers to ensure the widest possible availability of these services. In the final year of the National Development Plan 1994-1999, the Government made 26 million available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. A total of 13 projects nation wide were supported and are now nearing completion. The majority of these projects entailed the roll-out of broadband services in the western counties. In a project valued at more than 5 million, Esat extended <Col N="274" /> its backbone network to Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo covering the towns of Athlone, Ballina, Claremorris, Roscommon, Castlerea, Ballyhaunis, Sligo and Collooney. Eircom also received funding for the provision of optical fibre cable along a 32 km link on a route connecting Galway and Castlebar. It also received support of more than 5 million to upgrade 75 switches in the western area, giving these switches broadband connectivity. Undertakings by Chorus, supported by the Government, involved the roll-out of a co-axial cable network in Castlebar.</P>
    <P>The figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives by this Government has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to 200 million. There is a commitment that two thirds of this budget will be spent in the Border, midlands and western region. A first call for proposals was run last year and on foot of submissions received, the Department of Public Enterprise entered nine contracts at the beginning of the year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. The projects involved will be completed over the next two years and will entail overall investment of 160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately 55 million. The western region will benefit substantially from these projects. Progress is well under way. For example, Nevadatele has completed a telecoms centre in Carrick-on-Shannon, while Crossan Cable is constructing a metro-fibre ring in Longford town and ESBI have begun to roll-out fibre in Donegal.</P>
    <P>Successful implementation of these projects will assist in the attraction of inward investment in regional areas. It will also facilitate developments such as teleworking by providing cheaper and better access to on-line services and assist the public sector in the improved delivery of services to clients. In co-operation with the relevant development authorities, both regional and national, the Department of Public Enterprise is currently running a further call for proposals for additional broadband roll-out projects. A total of 55 million is being made available and the date for submission of projects is 19 October. Two thirds of the funding available will be allocated to the BMW region. Specific funding has been ear-marked for local authority and public body interventions, giving a local planning opportunity to the delivery of this infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In an additional initiative, a feasibility study has been undertaken on behalf of the Department to consider options on addressing certain infrastructural gaps in the country, including the BMW region. On foot of this study, the Minister for Public Enterprise is currently seeking expressions of interest from the private sector on the potential to build and manage an Atlantic broadband corridor. The Government intends to give full consideration to such a possibility before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As to public transport, I would point out that £650 million is being allocated under the national <Col N="275" /> development plan to address regional public transport requirements to include a £500 million railway safety programme as well as renewal and upgrading work and a further £150 million programme for regional public transport. Moreover, arising from the report &lsquo;Iarnród Éireann: The Way Forward', the Department of Public Enterprise will carry out a major rail strategy study to develop a long-term approach to rail services. Rail proposals which have a regional development dimension will be examined in the course of the study.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives are under way to address the issue of public transport in rural Ireland. The Rural Ireland Initiative which was launched on 2 July aims to promote and support the development of innovative, community based pilot public transport projects in rural areas and is funded by a provision of £3.5 million in the national development plan. Proposals received under the initiative are now being assessed by area development management on behalf of the Department of Public Enterprise. Arising from the report of the interdepartmental working group on rural public transport, the directors of community and enterprise of each county are currently carrying out an audit of public transport services and needs in their rural areas. Similar audits have already been carried out in Kerry, Mayo, Laois and Westmeath. It is hoped to have the work completed by the end of this year. In addition, a new interdepartmental committee, chaired by an official of the Department of Public Enterprise, was established recently to bring forward recommendations for a rural public transport policy. Among other things, the committee will draw on the experience gained from the pilot projects under the Rural Transport Initiative and will take on board the results of the county audits in completing its work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies McCormack, Ulick Burke and Michael D. Higgins.</P>
      <P>This motion provides a very timely reminder of the failure of this Government, after four-and-a-half wasted years of office, to upgrade the national road network to a 21st century standard and to give a fair share of investment to the west. From many years experience in my constituency of Kerry South I know the Government has left the west lagging behind. It has failed to address the regional imbalance between east and west. Western counties, including my own, have not received either enough resources or attention from this Administration. This applies not only to the BMW region, which I assume is the main focus of the Fine Gael motion, but also to other counties along the western seaboard, including Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a geographical imbalance in the provision of public services in many spheres, including health, education, transport and especially infrastructure. People in many parts of the west <Col N="276" /> are still less likely to have good infrastructure than those living along the east coast. Perhaps one of the biggest surprises about the announcement of the counties covered by Objective One status was the exclusion of Kerry. Given the political heavyweights representing the constituency, we were led to believe that the granting of Objective One status to the county was just a formality, a matter of rubber-stamping the decision. Objective One status, we were told, would be no problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin" hpid="Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Nowhere was Objective One status needed more than County Kerry, particularly south Kerry. The Government let us down. All the promises and assurances added up to nothing. My constituents have not forgotten that the promises made to south Kerry, as with so many other Government promises in recent years, were empty. When the county was not granted Objective One status we were told that everything else possible would be done to invest in roads and infrastructure in south Kerry. At the last election the constituency was promised new roads over every peak and through every valley. We were even promised tarmacadam up to our back doors.</P>
      <P>Members will be aware that this is not the first time I have raised these issues. I have repeatedly raised the disgraceful state of the road network in south Kerry, which is also the case in so many other areas mentioned in the Fine Gael motion. There are roads in my constituency which have deteriorated considerably since this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats-Independent coalition took office. I have spoken here on numerous occasions about the N86 from Tralee to Dingle, the Killarney to Rathmore road, the Tralee to Killorglin road and many others. I have spoken, too, of the cats' eyes put down on new road surfaces only to be found in ditches hours later, of roads full of new potholes, of the cars that drive over them being shaken to pieces, of the line painters who have painted white lines in water filled potholes. It is an absolute disgrace. The people of south and west Kerry often prefer to walk to their nearest town or village rather than inflict the tortuous journey on their vehicles. Women friends of mine have returned home to their families after a day's work with tears in their eyes because they have had to drive through gaping craters in the roads in parts of south and west Kerry. This comes at a time when my constituents are being told there are unprecedented levels of investment in their roads. That is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure I speak for many Deputies from western counties when I say the Government has failed miserably to provide for co-ordination of ministerial responsibility to improve services in western counties. The Government claims to have a national spatial strategy and to be addressing the geographical imbalance in infrastructural investment in the country. I invite the Ministers, <Col N="277" /> many of whom have visited my constituency, to experience the reality of the fate of many of the national primary and secondary roads in south Kerry. I can provide this House with many examples of the failure to ensure uniformity of investment in the roads in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The neglect of the west by the Government is not limited to the lack of investment in our roads. Another prime example of its utter neglect of the regional imbalance is the post office issue. I welcome yesterday's decision by the European Union, which goes some way towards stabilising the future of rural post offices. However, much more needs to be done. Because I represent a rural sparsely populated constituency I am very cognisant of the importance of the rural post office. There are very few towns or villages in south Kerry without a post office. Each one is as much an integral part of the community as the local shop, school and Garda station. The post office is fundamental to our social fabric. It is a hub of activity and crucial venue for community interaction. In other words, the post office is a fundamental feature of rural life, especially in parts of the west.</P>
    <P>The Government, of course, does not share this view. Ever since the post office began to run into problems the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has shown her disregard for this vital institution. We could expect no better from a Minister who presided over the sell-off of many of our State assets. Her attitude to An Post is hardly surprising when one considers her appalling record on Aer Lingus. She has done more to alienate and isolate those working in An Post than any other Minister in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Another issue which comes within the remit of this motion is the provision of rural transport in the west. Rural Ireland, including many constituencies like my own, has suffered decades of neglect in terms of the availability of transport. Admittedly, all Governments share responsibility. However, at this time of unprecedented economic buoyancy, to continue to neglect rural transport is unforgivable.</P>
    <P>Isolation in rural areas is a significant social problem. Many elderly people living alone rarely get out of their houses to do shopping or visit friends or neighbours. Too frequently they have to rely on relatives to drive them to the shop, mass or collect their pension. Surely in this day and age those living in remote areas deserve to have some means of transport either provided or subsidised by the State, even if only once a week, for example, on pension day to allow the elderly to collect their pension, shop for a few hours in the nearest town or village or visit a friend. The service provided by Bus Éireann is insufficient to meet those needs. There is an onus on the Government and all parties to consider providing such a service now that we have the necessary revenue.</P>
    <P>A further area in which the west continues to suffer, especially since the events of 11 Sep<Col N="278" /> tember, is tourism. The most conservative estimates indicate that the tourism industry will lose up to £250 million in the next 12 months. In my constituency alone 1,000 people face redundancy. With the decrease in tourist traffic coming into Farranfore, Galway and Shannon airports and the question mark over the viability of Knock Airport it seems likely the west will bear the brunt of the downturn in the tourism industry. I appreciate no one could have foreseen the horrific events of 11 September and their effects on the country's tourism sector. However, I appeal to the Government to examine the proposals made by representatives of the industry in recent days calling for a new marketing campaign in the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States to encourage greater numbers to visit Ireland not only by air, but also by sea. I am well aware of the effects of 11 September on the west as well as other factors affecting tourism, including the foot and mouth outbreak earlier this year and the rail disputes last year. The future of tourism, particularly to the west, is at stake.</P>
    <P>We should not be expected to give uncritical praise to the provisions of the national development plan, which, I accept, contains many financial commitments. Given that we now have more resources available to us than ever before, why should it be otherwise? The proof of the pudding, however, is in the eating. All the financial commitments are worthless unless they produce real effects and substantial benefits for my constituents and others on the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>I assure this Government the people of south Kerry will not easily forget its failure to give them a fair share of investment in infrastructure and public services. I commend the proposals made in the Fine Gael motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion. It is very timely because it condemns the Government for its failure to improve services for the Western counties. The Government amendment to that motion includes the projected investment of 26 billion over the period 2000 to 2006 in roads, public transport, environmental infrastructure, housing, health and educational facilities. It can be clearly seen in any of these areas how much the Government has failed to realise those projections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give an example: there is a request on the desk of the Minister for Education and Science for the upgrading and renovation of seven national schools within a radius of ten miles of the town of Loughrea. These are small works necessitating a very small financial contribution from the Department of Education and Science. Over the past four years, the boards of management and principals of those schools have been notified that this request has been rejected. Last week in a reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister tells me that they will be considered in the new Estimates for the forthcoming year. Young people in poor educational facilities have been pushed further back again. That is the bal<Col N="279" /> ance that exists between my side of the county and the rest of the BMW region.</P>
    <P>In the area of health, the waiting lists in the Western Health Board area which makes up the biggest portion of the BMW region, have increased dramatically in areas of greatest need. If this is what the Government regards as progress, that is fine. I hope the people will give them an answer within the next year and do what is necessary &ndash; get them out and allow somebody else to take over.</P>
    <P>In 1997 when the Taoiseach took office, his first action was to offload the Department with responsibility for proper development in the west to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, into a wilderness in which it remains.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey was here up to a few minutes ago. When he was declared a fully-fledged Minister, he took upon himself the mantle of &ldquo;Minister for the west&rdquo;. Many groups in the BMW region were delighted to think that at last they had a representative at the Cabinet table. This has not been so. Deputy Fahey shunned the responsibility for development in the west of Ireland. Instead, Deputy Ó Cuív, used the slush funds within the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands as his own personal slush fund in order to improve his own constituency. This was too much for Deputy Fahey to take so he had him shafted and chased into that particular wilderness in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>Not a man to be put down, Deputy Ó Cuív comes up with CLÁR &ndash; Ceantair Laga Árd-Ríachtanais &ndash; or the programme for revitalising rural areas, and as we all know, with special emphasis on his own constituency area in the Gaeltacht of Connemara. None of the other Ministers can contain him. Everything in his CLÁR programme contradicts the national development plan. Here is a rebellious Minister who has decided that enough is enough and he will do it his way. The CLÁR programme is the Ó Cuív slush fund for the development of Connemara and that is western development under this Government. I hope this motion will be carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion in the names of Deputies Kenny and Gerry Reynolds and the other Fine Gael Deputies. It is quite obvious this Government is not committed to the west of Ireland. For decades the Fianna Fáil party has taken the west of Ireland for granted because it always had a majority of support there. That is changing now. It has changed in Mayo, in east Galway and it will change in other areas also. People cannot be taken for granted and they are not asleep &ndash; they will react at the ballot box.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan-Cronin referred to Objective One status. Three years ago, the Fine Gael and Opposition Deputies led a campaign to grant Objective One status to the Border, midland and <Col N="280" /> western counties. Fianna Fáil reluctantly joined the campaign &ndash; it was shamed into it. It had all sorts of excuses saying that the EU countries could not be divided into regions for Objective One status and so on. This was despite the fact that Spain, Germany, Italy, France, Austria and Scotland had previously been awarded Objective One status in their regions. We were given Objective One status because we qualified for it &ndash; counties with under 75% of GDP. We put forward that case and it was accepted by Brussels. I want to ensure that the money will be spent in the western counties. The population increase in the eastern counties is growing by 3.2% while there is a 1.25% drop in the population in the western counties. In the last phase of Structural Funds, Ireland was given £5.175 billion but a breakdown on how that was distributed shows a clear discrimination against the west of Ireland. The 13 counties of Connacht, the Border and midland regions received £1.6 billion and the other 13 eastern and southern counties received £3.492 billion. Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon received £1.68 million and the four counties of Dublin, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, received more than that, more than the 13 counties in the BMW region.</P>
    <P>There are many essential projects in Galway city and county dependent on Structural Funds. I urge the Government to proceed. We urgently need a western distributor road on the west side of Galway city to relieve the traffic congestion. The case for the Connemara environmental scheme has been well made by Galway county council. Now that we have Objective One status in that region, I appeal to the Ministers with responsibility for the west who were present earlier &ndash; the three Ministers from Galway &ndash; to support this scheme. The Connemara environmental scheme was sent to the Department of the Environment and Local Government at an estimated cost of £72 million. Connemara is unique in Ireland and also in Europe. It is an ideal case to present for European funding because of the terrain in Connemara. Yet the only scheme sanctioned since 1995 was the Spiddal, Rossaveal and Aran Islands scheme. It is essential that it progresses. Several small areas and villages in Connemara are waiting for urgent sewerage schemes. Raw sewage is being sent into the sea from villages such as Claddaghduff, Cleggan, Clifden, Clonbur, Cornamona, Costello, Leenane, Letterfrack and Rossaveal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The collapse of the Independent Insurance Company Limited in Britain last June has had a very severe impact on Irish policyholders and businesses. This company was a major <Col N="281" /> insurer in the UK and had 600 business clients in Ireland. I wish to highlight the plight of many policyholders and commercial firms who are left exposed to civil claims estimated to be in the region of £150 million as a result of the collapse of the company. The Independent Insurance Company Limited had many clients based in Ireland, including construction firms and workers, hoteliers, engineers, caterers, marine workers and motorcycle and vintage car owners. The Government and the Tánaiste appear to have no appreciation of the seriousness of this issue. Many companies could face closure, jobs will be lost and outstanding claims may be left unpaid.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate businesses and individuals who find themselves without insurance cover as a result of the collapse of Independent Insurance Group are now being left to fend for themselves following inaction from the Government. No response plan has been put in place by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to deal with the many thousands of people affected by the collapse of the insurance company and no solutions have been offered by the Minister of State or his immediate boss, the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>What steps have been taken to address this matter? Has the Tánaiste been in contact with the British ambassador and has the Minister of State been in contact with the UK authorities? If so, what was the nature of the response and, if not, why not? What steps have been taken with the appropriate Ministers in the UK to deal with this issue? What steps have been taken with the European Commission to find a resolution to a problem that sees UK policyholders covered by a bonding system that appears to have no force in this jurisdiction yet the Minister of State can approve the operation of this insurance company in this jurisdiction? Over the past ten days since the resumption of the courts, cases are being listed for hearing on a daily basis. The insurance company has washed its hands of responsibility and has left defendant companies exposed to massive personal claims that they simply cannot afford to underwrite. Judges are left with no option but to enter judgments against firms and individuals who will be deemed personally liable in many cases. This will have devastating results. Jobs will be lost as otherwise healthy trading firms will be forced to the wall as a result of personal claims which they cannot underwrite and industry will suffer.</P>
      <P>Similarly, hundreds of plaintiffs in personal injury actions, many disabled and unable to seek alternative employment, with no means to look after themselves or their families, run the risk of not recovering any compensation for loss or injury suffered because cover has been withdrawn from the defendant companies. This is a most serious situation where the Government continues to sit on its hands and adopts a do nothing approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste, as a matter of urgency, should introduce legislation whereby the insurance fund accumulated through the payment of the 2% insurance levy could be utilised immediately to assist these companies in trouble. This fund was <Col N="282" /> used in the past where the PMPA was concerned in the early 1980s. The Minister of State claims the levy can only be used in situations involving an Irish company. If that is the case, urgent legislation can be agreed in this House to allow for the operation of this fund, notwithstanding the fact that the original company was based outside the jurisdiction. There is a fundamental anomaly in this situation. Why can insurance companies operate within this jurisdiction without bonding while they are bonded in other jurisdictions, giving rise to the disastrous situation which now exists? </P>

      <P>Independent Insurance Company Limited (IICL) was a UK authorised insurer. Accordingly, responsibility for ensuring that it could meet claims from its policyholders lay with the UK authorities who were responsible for the financial supervision of the company. The present position is that the company is in provisional liquidation and the liquidation process will be dealt with under UK law. This company is also under investigation by the serious fraud office in the UK.</P>
      <P>The UK authorities do not operate a &ldquo;no failures&rdquo; policy in relation to financial institutions and accept that there will be failures. The UK has however a safety net for policyholders of failed insurance companies whereby a policyholders protection fund compensates such policyholders' who meet certain criteria. The most important of these are that the policies must be regarded as UK policies and compensation is only available to private policyholders, unless liabilities are subject to compulsory insurance under UK law.</P>
      <P>Clarification obtained by us, through the Financial Services Authority in the UK, is to the effect that private policyholders who purchased their insurance through the company's Irish branch and policies issued to the policyholders of the Carol Nash insurance consultants book of business in Ireland, appear to be UK policies, for the purposes of the UK Policyholder Protection Act and are, in principle, protected policies, subject to the policyholders meeting all of the other requirements of the UK Act. The FSA goes on to say that protection will be limited to 90% and that policyholders will, in principle, be entitled to return of unexpired premiums of up to 90%, provided their policies contain a cancellation condition regarding rights to a return of premium on cancellation.</P>
      <P>We understand from the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland that, in the case of third party claims arising under policies covering compulsory third party insurance, application may be made to the bureau for the recovery of insurance losses not otherwise recovered as a result of the failure of Independent Insurance in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our information from the UK authorities is that Irish commercial policyholders are unlikely to be covered under the UK Policyholders Protection Act. They will be eligible, as creditors, for whatever percentage of claims the liquidator can eventually pay from the company's assets, including any amounts that might be recovered from <Col N="283" /> possible legal action against IICL's auditors or actuaries. Officials of my Department have met with officials in the UK Treasury Department and the Financial Services Authority. They stressed our concerns in relation to Irish policyholders with Independent Insurance Company Limited. The UK authorities have undertaken to consider the concerns expressed to them and we await a response from them.</P>
    <P>I have met with representative groups and with commercial policyholders of Independent Insurance, within a few days of the collapse in June. The collapse occurred on a Monday and we were notified on the Tuesday. I called in the Irish Insurance Federation on the Wednesday and asked them to provide alternative cover to the many companies which were under threat in the absence of any cover being available. Through that action we saved many companies which were in a serious situation. I met with the victims a few days later. I met all the business organisations and told them exactly what was required. I met them again two weeks ago and they still have to put forward the necessary documentation to me. I have asked both the policyholders and those representing them to let me have details of the exposure of Irish business as a result of the Independent Insurance collapse. Some of that information is now beginning to come to hand and I expect that further information will be sent to my Department officials as it becomes available.</P>
    <P>Those with claims outstanding are creditors of Independent Insurance and will be dealt with on the same basis as other creditors by the UK liquidators. While it is not yet known to what extent the liquidators will be in a position to satisfy creditors, there are no grounds for optimism. Following our meeting with the UK Treasury and Financial Services Authority officials, we will meet the liquidators of Independent Insurance in the near future.</P>
    <P>The gap in the EU's legislative framework in relation to the position of policyholders in the event of failure of an insurer writing cross-border business, is likely to be discussed in forthcoming EU meetings. While these discussions will probably eventually lead to EU agreement on an appropriate compensation mechanism, it will not be of practical assistance in the present case. When the directive was being introduced in Europe, Ireland was the only country to draw attention to the potential anomaly in the impact across member states in the event of a collapse by a company registered in a different jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor any Irish Minister had any responsibility for the Independent Insurance Company operating here or any involvement in its approval. Under European law once a company is registered to operate in one member state it has the right to deliver services in any member state. That is the position with this company. My Department will continue in its efforts to ensure Irish policyholders are treated in accordance with the principles of the Single Market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for coming in to reply. I find it hard to believe that I am here asking the Government the reason thousands of people in my constituency of Kerry South were without an ambulance service for 11 hours last Friday night. I knew before I heard of this appalling case that the health services in this country were in crisis, but now I know it is even worse than that. Clearly, the health service is on the verge of collapse. The Government is no longer capable of providing even the most basic of services.</P>
      <P>Yesterday morning I received a telephone call to my constituency office to inform me that there was no local ambulance service in the greater Kenmare area between 9 p.m. on Friday and 8 a.m. on Saturday. Two staff members always work this 11 hour shift. On Friday night, however, at the last minute one of the staff members in the ambulance had to withdraw due to illness. To my shock and disbelief, the Southern Health Board was unable to provide the money to pay a replacement staff member, although it does not admit this. As a result, the ambulance service had to be shut down for the night at one of the busiest times of the week. This meant that for the entire night last Friday areas like Kenmare, Tuosist, Caherdaniel, Sneem, Loo Bridge, Kilgarvan and Lauragh were without paramedic services. There was a large wedding reception in one Kenmare hotel on Friday night as well as a major conference in another hotel which added to the pressures on the ambulance service on the night. The ambulance service that was available had to be provided from Killarney District Hospital. As I said in the House before, the ambulance service in Killarney, a large town, is already over-stretched and has enough to deal with without having to cope with a huge rural area such as the Kenmare area.</P>
      <P>The response of the Southern Health Board to this outrageous situation was a short, terse statement issued at lunch time yesterday. In the statement, which played on words, it claimed that it was unable to find someone to cover for that evening's on-call duty when there was a person available to provide the cover, who had actually started work, but was told to leave. Surely in this day and age the least we can expect is that rural Ireland will be adequately serviced by ambulances, particularly at one of the busiest times of the week.</P>
      <P>My constituency office has received a number of calls expressing serious concern about this situation. Many were astonished that this situation was allowed to develop in the backyard of my constituency colleagues, both of whom have claimed that south Kerry has gained hugely in every area of the public service since the last election because of their political influence and largesse. Nothing could be further from the truth, and my constituents know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> I am calling on the Minister to apologise to my constituents in south Kerry for failing to provide thousands of them in the Kenmare area with paramedic cover last Friday night. I ask him to explain the reason the Southern Health Board claimed it was unable to provide a replacement paramedic for this shift on Friday night when it was quite clear that somebody had volunteered to work the shift, albeit not an on-call staff member, but somebody who was fully qualified and capable of doing the work involved.</P>
    <P>This is arguably one of the biggest medical scandals in my constituency in many years and a shocking indictment of the Government and its paltry attempts to formulate a health strategy just as it is about to leave office. Will the Minister explain the reason this shocking event occurred because of the lack of a paltry £200 or so to pay the staff member who volunteered to work on Friday night? Has the health service really been stretched this far and are we now reduced to failing to provide an ambulance service in Kenmare because of the lack of such a small amount of money? Will the Minister give an assurance that this type of incident will never again happen in south Kerry or any part of the country and that the lives of thousands of people will not be put at risk because of the lack of a couple of hundred pounds?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I wish to respond to Deputy Moynihan-Cronin in relation to difficulties which arose over the past weekend in the provision of ambulance services in the Kenmare and south Kerry areas.</P>
      <P>The provision of ambulance services throughout the country is the responsibility of the respective health boards or authority. In this particular case, the Minister is advised by the Southern Health Board that the areas mentioned are covered on a full-time working basis during the day with emergency on-call facilities becoming operational from 7.30 p.m. until the following morning. The specific difficulties in Kenmare and south Kerry last Friday arose as a result of an illness to an emergency crew member on duty and difficulties in arranging cover for that crew member at extremely short notice.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, this was an unforeseen circumstance which was handled as expeditiously as possible by local management. Ambulance cover for the Kenmare area was available from other Kerry stations, the nearest being the Killarney station for this 11 hour period of night cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has assured the Minister that the service was managed and monitored at all times by the management team and control room at Tralee General Hospital and emergency cover was provided for the area. In cases where an ambulance in any station is out of its area, ambulance control dispatches the nearest available ambulance. In the particular case the Deputy has highlighted, the Killarney ambulance would provide the necessary cover. The Deputy will be <Col N="286" /> interested to know that there were no calls on the ambulance service for the area encompassing Kenmare and Killarney on the night in question.</P>

      <P>Government policy on the development of emergency medical services is set out in a number of documents, most notably the report of the review group on the ambulance service published in 1993. The report addressed, <i>inter alia</i>, the issue of the level of cover provided by ambulance crews and made recommendations on how improvements might be made.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made by the Southern Health Board on the implementation of the recommendations of the report. This progress has been facilitated by special development funding allocated to the board of in excess of £3 million in recent years. Much of this investment funding has been directed by the board towards improvements, on a phased basis, in the level of duty hours cover in all the board's ambulance stations. The board's service plans continue to address the issue of increasing the level of in-station duty hours cover with a consequent reduction in on-call hours cover.</P>
      <P>The reduction of on-call cover and the increase of duty cover to 24 hours is but one of the many aspects of the ambulance service that require development. The chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board last year established a strategic review group to review the implementation of the recommendations of the 1993 report in the board's area and, in particular, to address the issue of the appropriate level of ambulance stations and hours of cover in those stations with a costed implementation plan for all the board's areas. This strategic review will include a costing analysis for 24 hour cover in all the board's ambulance stations. The Minister has been informed by the board that this strategic review will be completed before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>I would like to take some of the information the Deputy has given that a person was available in the area. Perhaps she will give us documented evidence in that regard&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter. A major crisis has hit the Land Registry in recent months. It is now apparent that there are major structural problems in the Land Registry which, at first glance, seems to suggest there are not enough staff to handle the massive volumes of transactions processed through that busy office every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Registry office is one of the most important offices because it impacts to some degree or another on all people at some time during their lives. All property transactions, from the <Col N="287" /> traditional handing over of a farm, shop or site from one generation to another to the registration of millions of pounds worth of property in towns and cities all over the country, most go through the Land Registry. Even the humble bog plot must go the same route.</P>
    <P>Citizens are up in arms about the service they get from the Land Registry. It is now impossible to expedite even urgent applications for title registration. Many Dublin law firms who act as searchers for country solicitors have asked them not even to try to expedite cases because it is not possible. One west of Ireland solicitor described the situation as absurd last week. However, in fairness to the legal profession, it is carrying the can in the context of the public's frustration with the Land Registry. In this case it is not its fault. The delays are happening in the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>For a long time I have dealt with the Land Registry in my role as a public representative. It is most co-operative and professional. However, in recent times it has been submerged under the volume of work. It just cannot handle it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>It needs more staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>To illustrate the point, I have here a message sent by one firm of law searchers to its solicitors down the country. It states:</P>
      <P>We wish to advise that at present the Land Registry are unable to expedite folio, file plans and copy maps due to the excessive amount of backlog. Until further notice they are advising not to lodge expedite letters as it is holding up the process of file maps and copy maps being issued. Thanking you for your co-operation.</P>
      <P>That is from the law searchers, not from me as a Dáil Deputy. There is a huge problem. An ordinary map, which should take two or three days to deal with, could take five or six weeks or even 12 weeks. Section 49 applications take from two to five years. Anything connected with subdivision or the construction of a map takes a couple of years. Many of the most vulnerable, young couples starting to build a new house, are forced on to bridging loans just because they cannot get the title which would allow the loan to be paid.</P>
      <P>This issue was raised in this House on numerous occasions. Last year a case was made for increasing the fees on the basis that it would enable a greater number of staff to be employed. The fees for ordinary transactions, which averaged about £250, were increased to about £400. However, instead of getting a better service citizens are getting a much worse one.</P>
      <P>Unless somebody takes the whole system by the scruff of the neck &ndash; I do not know whether that means employing extra staff, changing the structure or privatising the Land Registry &ndash;  greater efficiency cannot be assured. Nobody is happy with it. It would be ironic if in the current economic climate the Land Registry office became an obstacle to progress. We would not want that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleague, <Col N="288" /> Deputy John O'Donoghue, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who could not be here tonight, I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to update the House on this issue which is of importance for many people.</P>
      <P>The increased buoyancy we have experienced in the economy in recent years has dramatically increased the number of property transactions which have to be processed by the Land Registry. In addition to the increase in property transactions, major infrastructural projects undertaken by the bodies responsible for systems and utilities, for example, Bord Gáis, the ESB, Coillte, the National Roads Authority, Bord na Móna and so on, have also placed considerable strain on the Registry's ability to provide essential services. As a result, the intake of applications has grown to an unprecedented level with each successive year setting new record levels. From current figures available, it appears that the intake of applications for 2001 will be approximately 160,000.</P>
      <P>The work carried out in the registries is complex and requires the greatest care to ensure accuracy. It also requires a level of staff training before staff become proficient in the work. In the circumstances, the staff in the Land Registry has worked very hard to give the best possible service to its customers and the Minister has asked me to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the staff for their continued dedication.</P>
      <P>Deputies may also wish to note that any cases involving urgency are dealt with expeditiously, in accordance with the customer service policy of the Land Registry. The length of time taken to complete cases varies depending on a number of factors, including the complexity of the case, the completeness of the documentation forwarded by the solicitors, the clarity of entitlement to title and so on. The efficient operation of the work of the Registry depends on the receipt of accurate information on applications and on prompt and accurate replies to queries by applicants or their legal advisers. By way of example, the Minister has been informed by the Registrar of Titles and Deeds that at present more than 29,000 applications are being held under query. These cases cannot be proceeded with until the queries raised have been satisfactorily dealt with by applicants or their legal advisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, to address the increasing intake of applications, the Minister received sanction from the Minister for Finance to increase the staffing compliment of the Land Registry by 77. The majority of these appointments have been made and the training of the new staff is now beginning to pay dividends. Already this year, to the end of September, more than 112,000 dealings, representing an increase in output for the same period of almost 47% over the year 2000, have been completed. The Minister has asked me to inform the Deputy that he recently received a further sanction for an additional 19 temporary posts, and a drive to recruit these staff is now under way. The Minister has asked me to assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the management and staff of the Land Registry to address the problems which have developed, mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the <Col N="289" /> levels of business. The Land Registry management is implementing some pro-active measures to help deal with the situation, including improvements to work flow the training and development of staff, the use of new technology, the launch of an e-commerce service and the computerised data capture of folios and maps.</P>
    <P>In relation to issuing maps, the Minister has asked me to inform the Deputy that the Land Registry has developed improved procedures whereby 600 maps are issued each day. I understand that 50% of all copy map applications on current folios are completed within 24 hours. A further 25% are issued within ten working days. Of the remainder, the ability of the Land Registry to deal with them depends on a variety of factors including whether a map needs to be specifically prepared, as opposed to merely copied and certified. The Minister is sure that Deputies will agree that, in the main, this represents a very good throughput of cases.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may also be aware, the Land Registry has been in the process of implementing computerised systems to manage its records base for several years. In July 1999, a major advance was made with the introduction of an Integrated Title Registration Information System &ndash; ITRIS. This system, which is designed to electronically store and manage information in relation to title registration, is being rolled out on a gradual basis across the organisation. ITRIS is currently available in nine counties serving more than 60% of the applications lodged in the Land Registry.</P>
    <P>A key element of this new system is electronic access service. This enables customers of the Land Registry who subscribe to the service to conduct on-line searches of folios and name index records through the Internet, where the folios are held in electronic format and to order copies of certain documents electronically. Deputies will agree that steps are being taken to improve the situation in relation to the processing of applications in the Land Registry and the Minister is confident that, with the recent appointment of additional staff and the programme of measures being taken, the situation will improve further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the matter of the number of women who have gone missing in the past ten years. The bodies of some of the women have been recovered but most have not. The sad and harsh fact is that no person has been caught or convicted for the ten murders in the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eight young women have gone missing from the Dublin, Louth, Kildare, Wicklow, Wexford, Laois and Offaly areas and their bodies have not been recovered. They are Annie McCarrick, Jo Jo Dollard, Deirdre Jacob, Fiona Pender, Ciara Breen, Fiona Sinnott, Bettina Poeschel and Eva Brennan. The bodies of two other ladies, Patricia O'Doherty and Marie Kilmartin, were found but nobody was convicted of their murders. The body of Marie Kilmartin was found outside Portlaoise. The <Col N="290" /> more time that passes, the less chance there is of finding the missing women alive. For the families concerned, however, hope springs eternal, particularly in the case of Bettina Poeschel.</P>
    <P>A number of questions arise with regard to these missing persons. Is it likely that eight individuals carried out eight separate murders, having planned them so methodically and efficiently and in such a manner that all of them have to date escaped detection? Could eight such murderers dispose of the bodies without leaving a trace? I strongly reject that possibility. This might have happened in one, two or three cases, but it is highly unlikely to have happened in all eight cases.</P>
    <P>The second possibility is one I raised with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the Dáil last April. I referred him to the comments of a former Garda detective, Gerry Carroll. In the course of a radio interview with Gerry Ryan, Detective Garda Carroll raised the possibility that a serial killer was involved in some of these murders. Deputy Shatter also raised the retired detective's views and asked the Minister whether a serial killer could have been involved. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, rejected these views out of hand, perhaps unwisely. He should reconsider the matter carefully in discussions with the Garda Commissioner. I have spoken to a number of senior gardaí and people involved in the detection of crime, and many of them appear to believe there is a strong possibility that a serial killer or killers are involved. This is a matter of the utmost importance and the Minister of State should convey that to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for maintaining Operation Trace. The operation is led by an experienced assistant commissioner of the Garda and experienced staff. The operation must be continued in each of the cases I mentioned. Each case must be re-examined and, if necessary, new personnel should be brought in to do so and to see if something might have been overlooked, which can happen.</P>
    <P>The people involved in these murders are cunning, clever, secretive and highly intelligent criminals. They leave no crime scene and no body. There are no forensic clues. That makes it difficult, if not impossible, to achieve a breakthrough. There are similarities in these cases. All the people concerned were young women in the prime of their lives. They were alone and there was no struggle involved. In eight cases, no bodies were found.</P>
    <P>The new case of the German national, Bettina Poeschel, demands that the Minister provides all the resources required by the Garda to carry out an intensive search. Extensive Garda inquiries should be carried out on a house-to-house basis across the Drogheda area. It could be extended nationwide if necessary, but particular emphasis should be put on the Dublin and Louth areas. This should be undertaken urgently.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Taoiseach should also ask the public to be vigilant and to report all unusual sightings to the Garda. These crimes must be solved and the perpetrators brought before the courts and, I hope, convicted. This will require <Col N="291" /> hard work by the gardaí and the co-operation of the public. Additional resources are essential. I hope, however, the gardaí will get a lucky break because that is what one needs to solve crimes of this nature. It is a matter of great importance and I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss it. It is being discussed among the public and there is a great deal of concern, particularly among young women, about the number of young women who have lost their lives in this manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is unable to attend the debate this evening, fully understands the concern of the House and the public in general in regard to cases of persons reported missing, particularly in the wake of the recent disappearance of a German national. This case is of considerable concern and, while it would not be appropriate to go into details, the Minister has been assured that the Garda is doing all it can to trace the person in question.</P>
      <P>The Minister takes this opportunity to point out that no useful purpose is served by speculation in the absence of facts, in particular, media speculation about possible links between missing persons cases. In addition, he does not feel it is helpful to prejudge the outcome of any one case or set of cases and believes that such speculation, however well intentioned, is not fair to the families involved who are suffering greatly.</P>
      <P>The investigation of missing persons cases is a matter for the Garda authorities. The Garda district officer of the area from where the person has gone missing takes direct responsibility for the investigation and employs all necessary investigative means, including, as required, the services of all specialist units. Moreover, a Garda liaison officer is appointed to liaise with one appointed family member and updates them on developments that take place. In addition, an administrative and statistical function is maintained in the missing persons bureau at Garda headquarters.</P>
      <P>The detailed deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, who considers that investigations of missing persons are more effective when they have the local focus that is achieved under existing arrangements. However, all relevant Garda structures and methodologies are constantly under review. In this regard, Operation Trace, which was established in late 1998 by the Garda Commissioner and is headed at assistant commissioner level, has devoted considerable time to re-examining a number of missing persons cases. The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that no discernible pattern has emerged that would support the theory that a serial killer could be responsible for a number of these disappearances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the manner in which these women disappeared creates particular difficulties for the investigating gardaí. As there is no crime scene, criminal profiling is not possible and analysis based on crime scene examination and pathological evidence is not available. Furthermore, victim profiling has not established <Col N="292" /> any link between the cases. Nevertheless, a unique database has been devised which facilitates cross-referencing of detail and highlighting of similarities between cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister assures the House, however, that each of the cases currently under review by operation Trace was originally investigated in depth by the Garda Síochána in the locality of the disappearance. The Minister has been informed that all information and leads relating to any of these separate cases is systematically and vigorously pursused and that Operation Trace has comprehensively reviewed the cases of six missing women and has yielded new lines of inquiries that have been pursued in conjunction with the original investigation teams.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also been informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána does all in its power to locate all missing persons. On an international level, the gardaí liaise with Interpol and non-governmental organisations where there is a worldwide network to trace missing persons. The House may be interested to know that Europol can now assist in missing persons investigations and that a representative has been nominated from each member state in the European Union for assistance and liaison in cases of suspected trafficking in human beings.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána operates an Internet website which gives details of certain missing persons. In addition, the PULSE computer system has been specifically adapted to support the gardaí in their investigations of missing persons cases and the improved information technology system has proved successful in tracing missing persons.</P>
    <P>In general, files on missing persons remain open until there is a conclusion to the case and each case is kept under continuous review. Many searches have taken place and further searches will be based on available information and intelligence. The Minister has been assured that contact is maintained on a regular basis with the families of missing persons.</P>
    <P>In relation to the five year period 1995 to 1999, during which period a total of 9,198 persons were reported missing, there are approximately 60 files still open. It can be seen from these figures that the vast majority of persons reported missing are located without having suffered any harm. However, this does not take from the seriousness with which the Minister regards those cases still open and assures the House that all necessary resources are being made available to the gardaí to enable them to carry out these investigations. These investigations are time consuming and progress is slow.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have assured the Minister that they will continue to carry out investigations into all outstanding cases and will make every effort to bring to justice the persons responsible if it is discovered that a criminal offence is involved in any such case.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 17 October 2001.</P>

      <P>I visited New York at the beginning of Ireland's Presidency of the Security Council earlier this month and held a range of high-level consultations on the agenda of the council for October. I met with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and senior UN officials and with US Secretary of State Colin Powell in Washington. I also took the opportunity to meet with all other members of the Security Council and representatives of NGO groups.</P>
      <P>My consultations included the subjects of terrorism, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Middle East and African issues and have been of great assistance in ensuring that our presidency of the council is fully informed. I intend to make a further visit to New York towards the end of the month and during this period I will chair an important meeting of the Security Council on East Timor.</P>
      <P>As President of the Security Council this month I would like to assure the House that we are engaging effectively on the range of issues on the SECCO agenda on the basis of our traditional commitment to peacekeeping, disarmament, development co-operation and human rights. In addition to ensuring the efficient conduct of the council's business, we will continue to bring an objective case-by-case analysis of the issues coming before the council. I believe that this approach has won us considerable respect among other council members and enabled us to have a significant influence on a number of conflict situations.</P>
      <P>Our presidency provides us with an opportunity to promote Ireland's broad foreign policy objectives and interests, consistent with the safeguarding of international peace and security. During October we are playing a key role in conflict resolution, peace-building, peacekeeping, human rights and humanitarian matters in areas of conflict around the world from Afghanistan to the Congo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our presidency has been overshadowed by the terrible events of 11 September in the US. A key priority for Ireland is ensure that the Security <Col N="294" /> Council follows up on Resolutions 1368 and 1373, agreed unanimously in the wake of the attacks.</P>
    <P>In co-ordination with the UN Secretary-General I encouraged the US to brief the council on 8 October on its military operation in Afghanistan and as President we will ensure that SECCO monitors developments closely. We have also secured the rapid establishment of a Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee which will monitor the implementation of Resolution 1373. The council will also be discussing the political situation in Afghanistan with the Secretary-General's newly appointed Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. I will be speaking to Mr. Brahimi myself during the week.</P>
    <P>Since January Ireland has been instrumental in focusing the attention of the Security Council on the grave humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. I have ensured that during October the council is monitoring the situation on the ground closely, including through regular discussions with those responsible for the UN's humanitarian and political work in the country.</P>
    <P>It is important that the fight against terrorism does not distract our attention from the pressing conflicts in many other parts of the world. During our Presidency we are giving priority to resolving difficult issues in the Congo, Burundi, Angola and Somalia. We will also assist in whatever way we can the cause of peace in the Middle East. The independence of East Timor is also an issue close to the hearts of the Irish people and I look forward to personally chairing the meeting of the council on East Timor on 31 October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that &ldquo;No one shall be held in slavery or servitude: slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms&rdquo;. Full adherence to the absolute values enshrined in the declaration is of paramount importance. The concept of slavery has broadened from the traditional concept of the slave trade and now includes practices such as bonded labour and child labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards, including opposing and seeking the elimination of all contemporary forms of slavery. Contemporary forms of slavery include practices such as bonded labour, the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography, the exploitation of child labour, the sexual mutilation of female children, the use of children in armed conflicts, debt bondage and trafficking in persons. We voice our concerns wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries, in inter<Col N="295" /> national fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE. While the issue of bonded labour or child labour has not so far been discussed at the UN Security Council, we remain vigilant for opportunities to pursue the issue in the context of ongoing discussions on specific issues.</P>
    <P>Efforts to eliminate contemporary forms of slavery involve a wide spectrum of international organisations, NGOs and governments. Slavery and human rights issues in general are normally considered by the UN bodies which have a specific role and expertise in this area, notably the Commission on Human Rights and the International Labour Organisation, ILO.</P>
    <P>The Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, an inter-sessional working group of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, is the UN body which has responsibility for the study of all aspects of slavery. At its twenty-fifth session in June 2000 in Geneva, it devoted priority attention to the question of bonded labour and debt bondage.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Mr. Tom Kitt, led the delegation to the Eighty-ninth International Labour Conference in Geneva in June of this year. He raised the issue of bonded labour, in the course of the discussion at the plenary session of the conference where he put forward a number of practical measures to address this specific problem.</P>
    <P>Minister of State, Deputy Kitt's proposals received the strong support of the majority of his EU member state colleagues. Mr. Juan Somavia, the Director-General of the ILO made specific reference to Minister of State's call for special measures to deal with the problems of bonded labour. Accordingly, the Minister of State looks forward to the governing body of the ILO, at its meeting in November next, approving a substantial four year technical co-operation programme in this area.</P>
    <P>The protection and promotion of the rights of all human beings is the first responsibility of every government. The persistence of contemporary forms of slavery, a most fundamental abuse of human rights, presents a challenge to all governments. Highlighting and addressing this issue is a priority for the Government.</P>

The Government has consistently called for an immediate end to these deplorable acts of violence and our position has been communicated to all parties to the Good Friday Agreement.

      <P>Since the beginning of this year, 266 punishment attacks have been recorded &ndash; 163 have been attributed to loyalist paramilitaries and 103 have been attributed to republican paramilitaries. However, given the nature of these attacks, these official figures probably understate the full extent of the problem.</P>

      <P>The Ireland Aid Review Committee has entered the final stages of its work and is currently engaged in the preparation of its report. This process is likely to be completed within a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>The Government appointed the 15-person Ireland Aid Review Committee pursuant to its commitment to meet the UN overseas development assistance target of 0.7% of GNP by the year 2007. The review committee has been given a number of tasks. These include examining and assessing the future role and management of Ireland Aid in responding to humanitarian crises and in helping to advance the objectives of poverty alleviation, sustainable development and the integration of developing countries into the world economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> The committee held its inaugural meeting on 13 February when it had an opportunity to consider various aspects of the current aid programme and the policy and management challenges posed by its expansion. These aspects have been developed at subsequent meetings. The committee has, <i>inter alia</i>, considered the views of the Ireland Aid Advisory Committee, the National Committee for Development Education and the Agency for Personal Service Overseas. It has also had meetings with Irish NGOs, e.g. Dóchas, Concern Trócaire, Goal, Self-Help Development International, Irish Missionary Union, and with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. Members of the committee have also participated in respective field visits to Ethiopia and Uganda where they witnessed the work being done under Ireland Aid's priority country programmes first-hand and had an opportunity to meet key NGO and other partners.</P>
    <P>The written submissions received by the review committee range in scope from full overviews of the aid programme to sectoral inputs and letters raising individual concerns. The Government deeply appreciates the various submissions made as a meaningful contribution to shaping the future of the Ireland Aid programme.</P>
    <P>While not wishing to in any way prejudge the outcome of the review committee's deliberations, its potential recommendations can be gleaned from its terms of reference. By this measure, they will relate <i>inter alia</i> to strategic priority policy areas, geographical range, social and economic development, agriculture and rural development. They will also cover a number of related issues including human rights, good governance, gender equality, peace-building and conflict prevention, sustainability, HIV-AIDS and meaningful local participation.</P>
    <P>In addition to considering the strategic and policy areas, the review committee will also make recommendations on the management and organisational structures which will be required to ensure that the Ireland Aid programme expands in the most effective and accountable manner. At the same time, the review reflects the underlying objective of creating greater public ownership of the Ireland Aid programme and greater public identification with its objectives and achievements. The review will examine how this might be attained through a meaningful dialogue between Ireland Aid, the Oireachtas, the Irish people, NGOs, aid workers, missionaries, the private sector and other stakeholders.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that, in making a number of key recommendations, the review committee will point the way towards ensuring that the Ireland Aid programme of overseas development assistance not only does more, but does more better.</P>

      <P>The British authorities have confirmed, through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, that no figures are available on the number of people forced to leave Northern Ireland. Given the nature of the problem, neither the groups involved in intimidation and coercion, nor the victims of it, make the information available to the authorities.</P>
      <P>The Government once again urges all parties who may have influence with paramilitary organisations to do all they can to end immediately this scourge on society, and to allow those already &lsquo;exiled' to return safely to their homes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report that enlargement accession negotiations are proceeding well. The Government's position on enlargement of the European Union is very clear: we view it as an opportunity of immense social, political and economic significance, both for candidate countries and member states. Given the importance attached to the process, the Government's approach to enlargement will remain unchanged: Ireland will continue to play a constructive role in the accession negotiations in Brussels, maintaining a practical approach to discussions and facilitating agreement, while closely monitoring key areas of negotiation that are of specific interest to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Ireland will continue to encourage all candidate countries in their efforts to adopt and implement the acquis of the EU. This guidance will be through participation in multilateral schemes such as PHARE and EU Twinning projects, and bilateral programmes.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, from 27-28 June of this year I visited the Czech Republic. During my visit, I paid a courtesy call on President Havel. The Czech Republic is one of the leading candidate countries involved in the current phase of EU enlargement and our discussions naturally focused on developments in the accession process. My visit occurred soon after our referendum on the Nice treaty and, I emphasised that the negative result should not be interpreted as a &ldquo;No&rdquo; to enlargement. I reiterated this Government's firm commitment to the further enlargement of the EU. I also underlined Ireland's continuing support for the Czech Republic's impressive progress in the negotiations. President Havel warmly received these comments and commended the ongoing contacts between our two countries.</P>
      <P>While I was in Prague, I had further meetings with Czech Prime Minister Zeman, Foreign Minister Kavan, the Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Vaclav Klaus and the Czech Senate Committee. These meetings allowed us discuss issues relating to Czech progress in the accession negotiations and were extremely productive and cordial.</P>

      <P>The signature of the Framework Agreement on 13 August was a significant step towards restoring stability to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM. It established a parallel process whereby the armed extremist groups handed over their arms to the NATO Essential Harvest task force while the FYROM parliament voted on a set of changes to the constitution guaranteeing minority rights and multi-ethnic representation in the state institutions. The arms hand-over was completed on 26 September and the armed groups announced their disbandment the next day. This was despite continuing delays in the FYROM parliament in advance of the final vote on the changes to the constitution.</P>
      <P>The Essential Harvest arms collection mission was thus a crucial part of this process. It met and exceeded its target, collecting over 3,800 weapons. Judged in the context of the subsequent disbandment of the so-called National Liberation Army, it must be seen as a significant success. At the request of the FYROM authorities, a new, smaller NATO mission Amber Fox is being deployed with German forces in the lead as additional security for international monitors from the EU and OSCE. UN Security Council resolution 1371 &ldquo;strongly supported&rdquo; the establishment of the NATO force.</P>
      <P>While considerable will has been shown by the political leaders on both sides to reach accommodation, I am concerned that hardline opposition to the necessary constitutional changes required by the Framework Agreement is blocking full implementation of the agreement, and increasing the potential for renewed instability. One of the consequences of the delay in the parliamentary process has been the decision to postpone the donors' conference planned for 15 October. However, I believe that with continued international engagement, led by the EU in close co-operation with the US, OSCE and NATO and supported by the UN Security Council, the process can be maintained and the basis laid for long-term stability, reconciliation and development.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Head of the European Union Monitoring Mission, Ireland is this month providing three observers to the mission in FYROM in addition to the personnel currently serving with that mission in the region. We have also provided three monitors for the OSCE mission in FYROM, including two senior border monitors. With the rapid expansion of the international presences facilitating implementation of the agreement, we will be considering further requests for personnel positively as they arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the situation of those people at sea in the South Pacific and seeking asylum in that region became apparent at the end of August, I asked our ambassador in Canberra to bring the concerns of the Government to the attention of the Australian authorities. I also asked our embassies to Norway and Indonesia to urge the governments in Oslo and Jakarta to work with the Australian authorities to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>The ambassador spoke to the head of the special crisis unit established by the Australian Prime Minister to deal with the situation. He was informed that a number of other governments had made similar appeals including those of the United States, Britain, the Netherlands and Austria. The fact was also mentioned that, along with Canada, Australia is the world's leading nation in terms of refugee intake &ndash; about 12,000 per annum. In view of numerous previous incidents of trafficking in human beings, the Australian government took the view that the protection of Australian borders is very much related to maintaining the integrity of Australia's migration policy and Australia's capacity to assist in relation to the settlement of refugees. They said they are attempting to deal with the humanitarian issues involved and also to cope with what is a very significant international problem. The Australian authorities have provided humanitarian assistance to those on board vessels, in particular, food, clothing, shelter as well as medical attention and supplies.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, 283 people from the first boat carrying asylum seekers, the <i>Tampa </i>and 237 from the second boat, the <i>Aceng</i>, are having their cases processed by the UNHCR on the island of Nauru in the South Pacific. Some 150 people from the <i>Tampa</i> are having their cases processed by New Zealand. There is also another group of around 200 having their claims determined in Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>I discussed the situation with the New Zealand Foreign Minister, Mr. Phil Goff, when he visited Dublin last month and he told me that New Zealand was playing a role to help address the serious humanitarian situation facing the asylum seekers and to assist Australia. Mr. Goff commented that the international community at large had a role with regard to these people, many of whom had fled Afghanistan. I agreed with that assessment.</P>
      <P>In our contacts with other countries and the UNHCR, we have been encouraging parties to work towards a speedy resolution of this difficult situation &ndash; which we hope will not become a tragic one &ndash; through dialogue. The humanitarian concern is the primary element in our approach, along with the expression of the expectation that all of the parties involved will fully abide by their obligations under international law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> The UNHCR has made informal approaches to the contracting parties to the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees asking them to do what they can to alleviate the plight of these asylum seekers and we are currently examining what practical help we might be able to provide. The countries in the region do have a particular responsibility which cannot be delegated to the UNHCR and I am confident that, with the co-operation they are entitled to expect from the other contracting parties to the convention, the situation of the asylum seekers in the South Pacific will be resolved.</P>

      <P>Since the arrest of the three men, my Department has been active in providing consular assistance to them with a view to ensuring that they are held in safe and secure accommodation, that they have reasonable living conditions and that they have adequate access to their legal representatives. Consular officials from our Embassy in Mexico have visited the men on a number of occasions and have raised these concerns with the Colombian authorities. Together with the recently appointed honorary consul in Colombia, the embassy has also provided assistance to representatives of the men's families who visited them in Bogota recently.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have written to the Colombian foreign minister to express our concerns and to ask him to request the competent authorities to expedite the case to the greatest degree possible.</P>
      <P>The three men will be tried under Colombian law and I understand that they have appointed legal representatives in Bogota who will advise them on how best to prepare and conduct their defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> My Department will continue to monitor this case very closely, including the questions raised in Deputy Quinn's question, and to provide all possible consular assistance to the three men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's position is very clear with regard to the situation that now pertains in Afghanistan. Ireland will continue to support proportionate and targeted action by the US and others pursuant to Article 51 of the UN Charter and Security Council Resolution 1368. The offer by the Government of Irish airspace and airports, in this regard, is fully consistent with our obligations under the UN Charter.</P>
      <P>The military action under way has been taken on the basis of evidence linking the al-Qaeda organisation to the attacks of 11 September as well as numerous other attacks on the United States over the past number of years, attacks for which Osama bin Laden has been publicly supportive in television interviews, and as a response to the Taliban's refusal to comply with the wishes of the international community by ending its support for terrorists.</P>
      <P>Once it was clear that the al-Qaeda network was implicated in the events of 11 September, the Taliban regime was given an opportunity to co-operate. It is worth recalling that the Taliban has been in defiance of Security Council resolutions for the past two years. However, the Taliban refused yet again to co-operate with the Security Council Council Resolution 1368 was quite clear in stressing &lsquo;that those responsible for aiding, supporting or harbouring the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors' of the terrorist attacks on 11 September would be held accountable.</P>
      <P>Immediately following the start of the US led bombing campaign, I discussed the situation with the UN Secretary General and with Secretary of State Powell. The following day, Ireland convened a session of the Security Council to enable members to be briefed by the US and British representatives. They made it clear that the bombing was being directed against military targets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the EU level, the meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 8 October expressed its strong support for the action being taken by the US led forces, in self-defence and in conformity with the <Col N="304" /> UN Charter and Security Council Resolution 1368.</P>
    <P>At this time, I particularly welcome the appointment by Secretary General Annan of his Special Representative to Afghanistan, Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi. Mr. Brahimi is meeting with the Security Council today. Our desire, shared I have no doubt by the whole international community, is to see the introduction of a government in Afghanistan which is truly representative, and responds to the needs and aspirations of the Afghan people. Ireland stands ready to assist in whatever way it can in achieving this.</P>
    <P>We are ready, with our partners, to take whatever action is necessary to ensure international peace and security. In this regard, the Government has already decided to accelerate work on the signature and ratification by Ireland of existing international anti-terrorism conventions.</P>
    <P>The International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, 1999, was signed, subject to ratification, in New York yesterday by the Irish Permanent Representative to the UN. The preparation of primary legislation to enable ratification of this convention is being given the highest priority by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 130 and 181 together.</P>
      <P>During the recent visit of Premier Zhu Rongji, I met with senior members of the Chinese delegation, including Foreign Minister Tang. We had a very useful and constructive dialogue on a wide range of bilateral, regional and global issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the bilateral front, we noted the rapid growth of our economic and trade relations and the very high level of bilateral co-operation in the economic and education fields. We identified <Col N="305" /> areas for further co-operation and a Memorandum of Understanding on cultural relations between the two countries was also signed during the visit.</P>
    <P>Human rights issues were raised by the Taoiseach in an open and frank way during his private meeting with the Premier and during the plenary meeting with the Chinese delegation, which both Foreign Minister Tang and I attended. The Taoiseach set out Ireland's concerns, in particular in relation to the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners. The Taoiseach took the opportunity to raise the case of Mr. Zhao Ming, the Trinity College student currently detained in China. The Premier undertook to raise this case with the judicial authorities on his return to China, and the Government has been assured that this has been done. We will continue to closely monitor the situation.</P>
    <P>The Premier was travelling to Brussels following his visit to Ireland and he was aware of the importance we attach to the ongoing dialogue between China and the EU on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>I would conclude that the Premier's visit was a successful one, raising awareness of Ireland in China and deepening understanding between our two countries. The Premier left keenly aware of the degree of public interest in Ireland in the human rights situation in China. The Government intends to build on the progress made during this visit to further deepen and broaden our relationship with China.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1999 a peace agreement was signed in Lomé, aimed at bringing an end to the eight year civil war between the Government of Sierra Leone and the rebel forces of the Revolutionary United Front &ndash; RUF. The terms of the agreement called for a total cessation of hostilities, the laying down of rebel arms in exchange for places in the Government, and an amnesty for all crimes committed during the civil war. However, the Secretary General of the United Nations appended a statement to the agreement that the amnesty provisions do not apply to international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of international law. Ireland recognises that very difficult compromises were reached in the Lomé peace negotiations between the parties to the conflict but does not of course favour amnesties for such crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Resolution 1315 of 14 August 2000, the Security Council asked the Secretary-General to negotiate an agreement with the Government of Sierra Leone to create an independent special <Col N="306" /> court to prosecute those who committed crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the establishment of the special court for Sierra Leone and has committed £500,000 to it over the next three years. I am anxious to see it up and running at an early date. Ireland is a member of a group of interested states working to achieve the early establishment of the court. The agreement for the court was due to be signed this month but has been delayed by a proposal from the Government of Sierra Leone that the temporal jurisdiction of the court be extended.</P>
    <P>The Government has been monitoring closely the situation of members of the RUF, who have been detained for some time pending trial before the special court. I am particularly aware of the need to respect and protect the human rights of the detainees and am mindful of the fact that any further delay in the establishment of the court could impact significantly on their human rights, including their right to a fair trial.</P>

      <P>The Syrian government was quick to express its outrage at the events of 11 September in the United States and has also assured the United States and the international community of its support for the international effort to combat terrorism. Syria has recently been elected as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and will join the council on 1 January 2002. I congratulate Syria on this honour and look forward to close co-operation between their representatives in the council and our own. As a member of the council, Syria will have an important public role to play in the development of the international consensus against terrorism in all its forms.</P>
      <P>Syria is itself a secular state which embraces a range of religious communities, Moslem, Christian and Jewish. There have been allegations of Syrian support for certain terrorist groups. However, Syrian leaders have made it clear in their public statements that the Syrian Government is fully conscious of its responsibilities as a member of the international community and an avowed supporter of the international campaign to counter terrorism.</P>
      <P>Ireland will work with others in the Security Council to sustain the international consensus to support that campaign and we look forward to the full co-operation of all the members of the council.</P>

      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provided that consideration be given to the establishment of an independent consultative forum, appointed by the two administrations, North and South, and representative of civil society on the island. In addition, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government gave a commitment to work for the early establishment of this forum. The Government also recognises that there is no predetermined outcome to the process of consideration mandated by the agreement. Accordingly, this matter can only be progressed in full partnership with the Northern Ireland Executive.</P>
      <P>At the last plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, held in Dublin on 26 September 2000, the council agreed that a joint North-South working group, comprising officials of both administrations, be tasked with studying the establishment of the forum and reporting to the next plenary. The work of the joint working group is well advanced and a report will be made to the next plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, when convened. It will then be up to the council to decide how to proceed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, following the successful outcome of the referendum held last June, Ireland will be in a position to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court once the necessary implementing legislation is prepared and enacted into law by the Oireachtas. As <Col N="308" /> I have stated to this House previously, the task of preparing this legislation falls to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and my Department is very willing to provide any assistance it can to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court is a very complex instrument, which requires detailed consideration to establish the precise nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be taken. An active part is being taken in discussions at the international level in a number of fora, for example, the Council of Europe and the International Criminal Court Preparatory Committee, with the aim of ensuring that the necessary domestic measures are taken by states not only in timely fashion, but also in a comprehensive and consistent manner.</P>
      <P>Ireland, along with its EU partners, has been a consistent supporter of the International Criminal Court. In June of this year the Council of the European Union adopted a Common Position, the objective of which is to pursue and support an early entry into force of the Rome Statute and the establishment of the court. I remain committed to the speedy ratification by Ireland of the Rome Statute.</P>

      <P>I understand that Carmen Pungo and her partner were two of the 61 Colombian trade unionists murdered since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>In common with our EU partners and the wider international community, we have strongly condemned the persistent and increasing attacks by paramilitaries against human rights defenders in Colombia, including trade unionists. While we welcome the measures undertaken by the Colombian ministry of the interior to protect social and human rights defenders, including the establishment of a new protection programme for trade union activists and journalists, in addition to the existing and broader Special Programme for the Protection of Witnesses and Threatened Persons, we urge the Colombian authorities to take action to ensure that these measures are fully implemented and adequately funded.</P>
      <P>The EU will continue to stress to the Colombian authorities the need to address the lack of effective judicial investigations into crimes against social and human rights defenders, as well as the insufficient legal, administrative, security and financial measures to protect those social and human rights defenders who find themselves at risk.</P>
      <P>On 30 July 2001, the following statement was issued on behalf of the European Union by the Belgian Presidency: </P>
      <P>The European Union wishes to express its deep concern at the mounting violence in Colombia, befalling foreign aid workers, international officials and Colombian citizens involved in the search for peace and in assisting the civilian population.</P>
      <P>The holding up of a UN vehicle and abduction of one it its occupants and the abduction of three German aid workers are the latest in a long line of other unlawful detentions of EU nationals and killings of foreign nationals, journalists and many Colombian citizens.</P>
      <P>These incidents seriously jeopardise the peace process and openly flout elementary principles of international law.</P>
      <P>They seriously compromise the international community's support for Colombia's peace process, hamper the facilitator countries' role and place unnecessary obstacles in the way of implementation of the European Union support programme announced in Brussels on 30 April 2001 and of bilateral co-operation projects.</P>
      <P>Such acts, moreover, serve only to strengthen the hand of those opposed to peace.</P>
      <P>The European Union urgently appeals for all hostages to be released without delay and for their physical integrity to be respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union furthermore calls on all parties concerned to renounce all forms of violence and to commit themselves to resolving <Col N="310" /> their differences through positive, constructive dialogue.</P>
    <P>This emphasis on full respect for human rights will continue to underpin Ireland's policy toward Colombia, as well as our contribution to the EU Programme of Support for the peace process in Colombia.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127, 150 and 152 together.</P>
      <P>I visited the Middle East from 9 to 11 September, when I cut short my planned tour in response to the terrible events in New York and Washington. During my visit, I met President Mubarak and Foreign Minister Maher of Egypt, with President Katzev and Foreign Minister Peres of Israel and with Palestinian President Arafat. My discussions with all of these figures revealed a depth of concern on all sides about the direction of the peace process.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity of this visit to express once again the consistent Irish view, which is shared by our European Union partners, that the only hope for peace in the region is a cessation of acts of violence on both sides and an early resumption of dialogue with a view to implementing the proposals in the Mitchell report immediately and without preconditions. I drew on our own experience of peace-making, in which Senator Mitchell also played such a distinguished role.</P>
      <P>I told Foreign Minister Peres and Israeli President Katzev that the lifting of closures on Palestinian areas, the release of funds owed to the Palestinian Authority by Israel and an end to settlement activity are all essential elements in any move towards dialogue. I spoke to Foreign Minister Peres by telephone on 24 September and reiterated the Government's desire to see a resumption of dialogue between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> Ireland has made these points on numerous occasions, both in public statements and at the Security Council. The European Union has also raised these issues repeatedly, both in declarations and in face-to-face meetings with the various political leaders in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>News of the atrocities in the United States broke as I was en route to Gaza to meet President Arafat with the intention of encouraging his efforts to renew the peace process. In the circumstances, our proposed agenda was replaced by a discussion of the attacks and their possible implications for the Middle East. We held a brief meeting before giving a joint press conference. I emphasised to President Arafat the need for clear and unambiguous condemnation of these atrocities and the need to distance himself and his supporters from terrorism and violence. The President was visibly shaken by the news from the United States.</P>
    <P>On 18 September President Arafat published his peace message to the people of Israel and ordered an immediate and complete ceasefire. In response the Israeli Government ordered a halt to offensive actions against Palestinians by their Defence Forces. I welcomed these moves in a statement that day.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see that the first face-to-face meeting for many months between President Arafat and Foreign Minister Peres took place in Gaza on 26 September.</P>
    <P>No one can be under any illusion that the parties to this conflict will resolve matters between themselves without international support and occasional pressure. There has clearly been a renewal of international commitment to the region in the past few weeks, which I welcome. Ireland will contribute to peace efforts in the region to the extent of our possibilities through the European Union, the United Nations and other international fora as well as in our on-going bilateral contacts with all the parties.</P>
    <P>The European Union has made a number of recent public statements concerning the unacceptable behaviour of the Israeli occupation forces in the occupied territories, with which Ireland is fully associated. A meeting of the parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilians in Time of War is under preparation at present to examine the behaviour of the Israeli authorities during the occupation. Ireland will participate fully in that meeting. The Government has not considered the possibility of breaking off diplomatic relations with Israel. It is important to maintain diplomatic contacts with both parties to the conflict through our Embassy in Tel Aviv and our representative office in Ramallah. This arrangement gives us a clear and balanced view of events and direct and immediate access to both parties. Most importantly, if Ireland is to exercise influence in this situation, it is essential that we are accepted as an impartial and fair-minded partner by both sides.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> Ireland has long recognised the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including their right to their own state. The best prospect of achieving a viable, independent state, which exists in fact and not only in name is, as the Palestinians themselves recognise, through the Middle East Peace Process.</P>
    <P>In terms of practical assistance to the Palestinian people, Ireland Aid has had a development programme for the Palestinian territories for some years. Ireland Aid expenditure there this year is budgeted at approximately IR£1.2 million in addition to the IR£1.24 million provided in emergency relief since the start of the Intifada.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128, 146, 148 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>Security Council Resolution 1368 of 12 September, which is binding on all members of the United Nations, calls on all states to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators, organisers, and sponsors of the terrorist attacks of 11 September and stresses that those responsible for aiding, supporting or harbouring the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of those acts will be held accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In offering over flight and refueling facilities to states whose forces are engaged in bringing to justice those who carried out or assisted in the dreadful attacks on the United States and are <Col N="313" /> seeking to prevent further such attacks, Ireland is living up to its responsibilities under Council Resolution 1368, as now reinforced by Resolution 1373 of 28 September.</P>
    <P>Ireland's offer is situated as part of the multi-faceted international response being pursued to the present crisis. This will involve efforts to bring to justice those behind the attacks on the US, co-operation in efforts in UN and EU frameworks to combat international terrorism, and determined efforts to address the conflicts and injustices on which terrorism preys.</P>
    <P>As regards the information on flights requested by Deputy Gormley, this is being compiled as a matter of urgency and will be communicated as soon as possible to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity during my meeting on 26 September with US Secretary of State Mr. Colin Powell, to formally convey the Irish Government's offer of overflight and landing facilities. The US had not requested the use of such facilities. Secretary Powell expressed his appreciation for Ireland's solidarity and support.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>The question of the representation of Taiwan arose at a meeting of the General Committee of the UN General Assembly to approve the organisation of the current session. At this meeting on 14 September, Ireland reaffirmed its commitment to the &ldquo;One China policy&rdquo;. Some 67 delegations, including Ireland and five EU partners &ndash; UK, France, Italy, Spain and Greece &ndash; spoke on similar lines. The &ldquo;One China Policy&rdquo; has been accepted by successive Irish Governments, as well as by all EU Partners and the United States. In accordance with this &ldquo;One China Policy&rdquo;, the Government considers Taiwan to be part of China. Furthermore, Ireland regards the matter of Chinese representation at the UN as settled by General Assembly Resolution 2758 of 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government wishes to see the cross-strait issue resolved through dialogue and peaceful means. We remain hopeful that dialogue between China and Taiwan will commence at an early date, and hope that the pragmatic economic links <Col N="314" /> which continue to grow between the two peoples will assist in promoting a broader dialogue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1978 UNESCO Declaration and the 1969 UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination are the most widely acknowledged definitions of racism and racial discrimination. These definitions have been accepted by successive governments in framing legislation in this area and provided the conceptual background to the proceedings of the World Conference Against Racism held in Durban, South Africa from 31 August to 8 September 2001.</P>
      <P>The UNESCO Declaration states: &ldquo;Any theory involving the claim that racial or ethnic groups are inherently superior or inferior, thus implying that some would be entitled to dominate or eliminate others who would be inferior; or which places a value judgment on racial differentiation, has no scientific foundation and is contrary to the moral and ethical principles of humanity&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, to which Ireland is party, states: &ldquo;. . . racial discrimination shall mean any distinction, exclusion or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The World Conference Against Racism in Durban, acting on those definitions and principles, declared: &ldquo; . . . that all human beings are born free, equal in dignity and rights and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well-being of their societies. Any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected along with theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity, at this time, to place on record in the House these definitions and principles which inform the Government's attitude to the pernicious doctrine that is racism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Deputy's question as to whether the imposition of ethnic or religious tests for citizenship of a country come within my <Col N="315" /> understanding of racism, I would refer him to Article 1.3 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination to which Ireland and 156 other States Parties subscribe:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. . . nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as affecting in any way the legal provisions of States Parties concerning nationality, citizenship or naturalisation, provided that such provisions do not discriminate against any particular nationality&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Considerable progress was made during the course of discussions at Weston Park in July on the outstanding areas requiring implementation under the Good Friday Agreement, including policing. These discussions led to agreement between the two Governments on a package of proposals which were then presented to the parties on 1 August.</P>
      <P>The proposals on policing included provision for a review by the independent Oversight Commissioner of all the new policing arrangements, as well as a commitment by the British Government to change the current legislation where this is necessary. Furthermore, a revised implementation plan was published on 17 August which set out in greater detail the British Government's intentions in relation to policing.</P>
      <P>It is the considered judgment of the Government that, when fully implemented, the 1 August proposals, the revised implementation plan, the Oversight Commissioner's Review and the British Government's commitment to introduce new legislation will deliver the spirit and substance of the Patten Report. The basis now exists for realising the new beginning in policing envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>It was in this context that the Government urged all parties to give positive consideration to nominating members to the Policing Board.</P>
      <P>The SDLP's decision to support the new policing arrangements and to nominate to the new policing board was a significant and very positive development. The Government also welcomed the decisions of the two main unionist parties to nominate members to the board. We hope that, in time, Sinn Féin will find it possible to participate in the new policing structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that arrangements are now being made to convene the first meeting of the board in the very near future. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Policing Board, Professor <Col N="316" /> Desmond Rea and Denis Bradley, working together, will play a crucial role in directing the work of the board in the critical start-up phase when many important matters will have to considered. We wish them well as they begin their hugely important work.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's view that everyone should now give their support to the new Police Service, and that people from all sides of the community should feel free to consider &ndash; without hindrance from any quarter &ndash; a career serving the community in the new police service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The political and human rights situations in Iraq and Iran are separate issues and are not comparable. I will therefore respond separately on both.</P>
      <P>The political and human rights situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate. The regime of Saddam Hussein which has been in place in Iraq since 1979, controls all organs of state, government and public life. The UN Commission for Human Rights earlier this year adopted a resolution strongly condemning the systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law by the Government of Iraq, resulting in an all-pervasive repression and oppression sustained by broad-based discrimination and widespread terror. This includes the suppression of freedom of thought, expression, information, association, assembly and movement of persons through fear of arrest, imprisonment, torture, execution, expulsion, summary and arbitrary executions including political killings, enforced and involuntary disappearances, and the use of rape as a political tool.</P>
      <P>The government of Iraq continues to reject the demand of the Security Council that it allow UN arms inspectors to verify that it is not engaged in the production of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. It refuses to comply with UN Resolution 1284, adopted in December 1999, which established a new arms inspection body, the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, UNMOVIC, and provided for the suspension of UN sanctions if the government allowed arms inspections to be renewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and our EU partners remain gravely concerned at the repressions endured by the people of Iraq at the hands of the Hussein regime, and at the humanitarian crisis in the country resulting from the Government's continuing defiance of UN. resolutions and its deliberate obstruction of the UN. humanitarian efforts in Iraq. The EU will table a resolution on the human rights situation in Iraq at the current session of the UN General Assembly, which will again condemn in the strongest possible terms the <Col N="317" /> horrendous violations of human rights by the Government of Saddam Hussein.</P>
    <P>Presidential elections took place in Iran on 8 June 2001. President Khatami was re-elected with 77% of the popular vote. A new government appointed by the president was approved by the Iranian Parliament in early September. President Khatami has stated that his new government will continue to advance his existing programme of economic, social and political reforms. It is expected that, as with the previous Khatami government, the progress of those efforts will be dependent on the balance in the positions of the various political and clerical institutions in Iran.</P>
    <P>Ireland and our EU partners have welcomed the political reform process under way in Iran and the improving relations between Iran and the EU.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the EU remain concerned at the human rights situation in Iran. In particular, we are concerned at recent court decisions in the areas of political and press freedom, and on the death penalty, where the EU deeply deplores the resumption of stoning as a means of execution. President Khatami has expressed his concern at these developments, but his government can exercise only limited influence on the courts, which are controlled by the religious establishment.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, the EU successfully tabled a Resolution at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights on the situation in Iran. The EU is currently preparing a draft resolution for the current session of the UN General Assembly. This will, <i>inter alia</i>, call on Iran to continue its efforts and take further measures to ensure full respect of human rights and the rule of law. It will address the still-existing discrimination in Iran against women and against persons belonging to certain minorities, in particular the Baha'is It will call for Iran to co-operate with the Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>The Nice European Council in December 2000 decided that there should be a wider and deeper debate about the future of the European Union, to culminate in a further Intergovernmental Conference in 2004. It was envisaged that the European Council at its meeting in Laeken in December 2001 would agree on how the process should be carried forward.</P>
      <P>Although no formal decisions have yet been taken, it appears, including on the basis of discussion in the General Affairs Council on 8 October, that there is consensus on the establishment of a convention which would begin its work during the first half of next year. While many important questions remain to be settled in detail, it appears probable that the convention would include representatives of member state governments, national parliaments, the European Parliament, the European Commission, and the candidate countries. I expect that the nomination of Irish representatives would, as was the case with the convention which prepared the Charter of Fundamental Rights last year, be for the Government and the Oireachtas respectively.</P>
      <P>The Government can support the establishment of a convention, and we believe that it can play an important role in developing debate and in clarifying the issues which arise out of the four specific questions identified at Nice last year. It is important to be clear that any further eventual treaty changes would be for the member states alone to agree, in the planned intergovernmental conference. For this reason, we and other member states are strongly of the view that the convention's remit should be focused on the preparation of options for further consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the situation in the Turkish prisons. The hunger strikes both inside and outside the prisons have now claimed the lives of some 41 prisoners and their supporters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of representations already made by the Government in connection with the crisis. On my instructions, the Irish Ambassador to Turkey raised the matter with the Turkish Foreign Minister earlier this year, explaining the importance we attach to a satisfactory resolution. On 25 April, the Government issued a statement expressing its deep regret over <Col N="319" /> the deaths and urged the Turkish authorities to act to avoid further loss of life. I repeated this call in the House on 19 June. In doing so, I also urged the prisoners, as well as their representatives, to participate as a matter of urgency in efforts to reach a solution.</P>
    <P>In this respect, I attach great importance to the role of the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture, CPT, which has special expertise in this area. The Deputy will be aware that members of the committee have been working with the Turkish Government and with the prisoners in an attempt to resolve the crisis and that they have travelled to Turkey on a number of occasions to visit the F-type prisons involved. The most recent visit took place in September. Two F-type prisons were visited so that the implementation of communal activity programmes, a key element in the dispute, could be examined. The delegation also met the Turkish minister for justice, the minister for the interior, the minister of state responsible for human rights as well as senior government officials. Though a full report on the visit is not expected until early in the new year, preliminary findings have been sent to the Turkish authorities.</P>
    <P>The CPT has no fundamental objections to the accommodation provided by the F-type prisons, but has repeatedly emphasised that moves towards smaller living-units for prisoners, of the type found in the new prisons, must be accompanied by measures to ensure that prisoners spend a reasonable part of the day engaged in a programme of communal activities outside their living-units.</P>
    <P>I endorse the view of the CPT that a resolution to the crisis will require a process of adaptation, explanation and confidence-building and that this will involve, <i>inter alia</i>, the examination of all complaints of ill-treatment against prisoners at the time the Turkish authorities intervened in the prisons in December last and, where appropriate, the prosecution of state officials.</P>
    <P>The Government fully supports the efforts of the CPT to help bring an end to the crisis in co-operation with the Turkish authorities and the prisoners. In this respect, I welcome the fact that a number of prison reforms have now been introduced, including measures to enhance prisoners contacts with the outside world and to establish prison monitoring boards and sentence enforcement judges. The CPT has undertaken to continue to monitor closely the practical implementation of these reforms.</P>
    <P>Once again, I urge that every appropriate action be taken as a matter of urgency to bring to an end the crisis in the prisons as well as the tragic loss of life.</P>

      <P>As the Taoiseach said in this House on Wednesday last, &ldquo;Press freedom is a cornerstone of a free and democratic society, and it is investigative journalists like Martin who serve the people and the democratic process by fearlessly investigating and impartially reporting on events&rdquo;. Those who carried out this heinous act have absolutely nothing to offer the people of Northern Ireland except violence and fear.</P>
      <P>We have raised this matter with the British authorities through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on a number of occasions, most recently at a meeting on 10 October. On Friday, 12 October, the Secretary of State specified the UDA, UFF and LVF and declared that their ceasefires were over. Speaking of his decision to include the LVF in this announcement, Dr. Reid said: &ldquo;I have clear information indicating the involvement of the LVF in the despicable murder of Martin O'Hagan&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have been assured that the security forces will do all within their power to bring the perpetrators of this dreadful act to justice. We have asked to be kept fully informed of developments in the investigation into this murder.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the progress he has made on the resolution of the perceived inconsistency between the Government's vote at the United Nations on Cuba and the common resolution adopted by member countries of the EU; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in stating that I have indeed acknowledged in this House that there is a perception of inconsistency between, on the one hand, the position adopted by Ireland and its EU partners at the UN in opposition to the US economic embargo against Cuba, and on the other hand, the EU Common Position on Cuba which continues to find &ndash; in its regular evaluations of the situation in that country &ndash; that conditions are not yet ripe there for the establishment of the kind of special partnership which the EU maintains with other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>However, the fact that such a perception exists does not mean that it reflects the reality. There is, in truth, no inconsistency.</P>
      <P>Unlike the US, the EU operates no sanctions against Cuba. On the contrary, EU member states carry on normal relations with Havana across the full spectrum of contacts from trade to culture. In fact, the Fifteen have actively developed their economic relationship with the island to such an extent that the EU is now Cuba's leading foreign investor, principal trade partner, premier source of tourists, and largest provider of development aid and humanitarian assistance.</P>
      <P>However, what the EU cannot do &ndash; as yet at any rate, and much though it would wish to do so &ndash; is to advance beyond normal relations to the kind of special relationship represented by the structured co-operation agreements which have been negotiated with other countries in the region. These co-operation agreements are partnerships based on the shared values of respect for democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, the authorities in Havana do not &ndash; at this time &ndash; share our view of these values. In its most recent annual report on Cuba, Amnesty International stated the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Individuals and groups peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly continued to face repression. Some conditional releases of prisoners of conscience gave rise to hopes that the attitude of the Cuban government towards dissidents might be thawing, but new sentences and a serious escalation in repression during the closing months of 2000 discouraged such optimism. Journalists, political opponents and human rights defenders were subjected to sev<Col N="324" /> ere harassment. Several hundred people, at least 13 of whom were prisoners of conscience, remained imprisoned for political offences. The authorities continued to use short-term detention, house arrest, threats and harassment to stifle and discourage political dissent.</P>
    <P>Following a close and careful assessment of the current conditions obtaining in Cuba, the EU General Affairs Council of 25 June 2001 agreed the following conclusions:</P>
    <P>The Council took note of the ninth evaluation of the EU Common Position on Cuba. The Council noted that since the previous evaluation last December, there have not been any substantial signs of change of policy by the Cuban Government towards the accomplishment of the aims of the Common Position. Furthermore, the Common Position remains the basis of the European Union's policy towards Cuba and therefore the Council took note of its continued validity.</P>
    <P>The Council reiterated that the objectives of the European Union towards Cuba remain the encouragement of a process of peaceful transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Although the socio-economic situation remains precarious, the Council has taken note of signs of improvement of living standards for the population.</P>
    <P>The Council considers that it is essential that the EU and the Cuban authorities engage in a constructive and frank dialogue on all issues of common interest. The European Union remains open to resume such dialogue. In the light of the ninth evaluation, the Council considers that a broader presence of EU actors in Cuba would lead to a more efficient pursuit of the Common Position as it would offer opportunities for an ongoing process of dialogue, exchanges of experiences and learning for the future.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Council encourages the European Commission to strengthen its efforts for co-operation with, in particular, civil and non-governmental organisations in Cuba. The Council would welcome engagement in a constructive dialogue with Cuba on a future co-operation framework based on respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law.</P>
    <P>The Council, therefore, was on this occasion reluctantly obliged once again to renew the Common Position, pending a change in Cuban policy regarding human rights and freedoms which would enable Havana to accept the standards applied by the EU to all countries &ndash; without any discrimination &ndash; wishing to have the kind of enhanced relationship with the Union inherent in an institutionalised co-operation agreement</P>
    <P>At the same time, in order to try to disperse any mistaken perceptions about EU policy of the kind invoked by the Deputy, the Council Conclusions also contained those very positive provisions, which I have just quoted, regarding the Union's eagerness for constructive dialogue with Cuba.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> Since then, the Belgian President of the Council, Foreign Minister Louis Michel, has acted on those provisions by visiting Havana to explore the possibilities for progress over the coming period.</P>
    <P>It would be gratifying indeed if such progress were to prove possible.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned about the human rights situation in West Papua, or Irian Jaya as it has been known since 1973. I am particularly concerned about reports of ill-treatment of Papuan prisoners.</P>
      <P>The EU is progressing towards reinforcing its political dialogue with Indonesia to include regular discussion of human rights and issues relating to Irian Jaya. The EU most recently set out its position on these issues at the General Affairs Council in May 2001. The EU called on the Indonesian authorities to strengthen respect for human rights throughout Indonesia and to ensure the democratic accountability of the police and armed forces. We urged the Indonesian Government to make further urgent efforts to address the fundamental causes of tension in Irian Jaya.</P>
      <P>The EU is actively pursuing dialogue with the new Indonesian Government at every level on these issues.

I reaffirmed that Ireland, as a member of the Security Council, is committed to reform of the sanctions so as to eliminate the suffering caused to the people of Iraq.</P>

That proposal focused on a revised system for the importation of goods into Iraq and a reversal of the underlying concept of how the sanctions regime operates so that all goods will be allowed into Iraq except those items specified on a goods review list. Ireland is supporting additional measures to restore Iraq's infrastructure and production capacity, to facilitate normal trade in civilian goods, and to allow for foreign investment and international service contracts.</P>
      <P>Both Bishop Gumbleton and Mr. von Sponek are acutely familiar with the humanitarian situation in Iraq and, in the case of Mr. von Sponek, with the enormous and very difficult task facing the UN humanitarian operations in that country. The meeting was a valuable and welcome opportunity for me to learn about both of their experiences. We were in full agreement on the urgent need to end the humanitarian crisis in Iraq and we had a constructive dialogue on the political challenges which also need to be addressed in the context of Iraq's obligation to respect and fulfil the requirements of the Security Council</P>
      <P>resolutions.</P>
      <P>Since my meeting with Bishop Gumbleton and Mr. von Sponek, I travelled to New York where on 1 October I held discussions on the situation with the head of the UN's Iraq office in New York, Mr. Benon Sevan. Mr. Sevan had just completed work on a further report from the United Nation's Secretary General on the humanitarian situation in Iraq. This report was discussed in the Security Council on 11 October, under Ireland's chairmanship. In addition to our role as Chair, Ireland made a strong national statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, we deplored the many failures of the Government of Iraq to co-operate honestly and effectively with the UN humanitarian programme and to look after the interests of its own people. In the view of the Council this remains the chief cause of the continuing unacceptable situation in Iraq. The Secretary General's report has made it abundantly clear that, through the programme, the Government of Iraq is in a position to address fully the nutritional and health requirements of <Col N="327" /> its people, particularly children. That Iraq has deliberately failed to co-operate with the UN to fulfil those needs is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Our statement also recognised and shared the legitimate concern that the application of sanctions is unnecessarily harsh in some instances. This is also borne out by the Secretary General's report. In particular, we regretted the rise in the value of holds on supplies required for essential sectors of the Iraqi economy. We called on the members of the Council and the Iraq Sanctions Committee to take the necessary action to address these concerns.</P>
    <P>We emphasised that rapid progress is required in the Security Council to place the sanctions regime on a new basis in time for the next roll-over of the humanitarian programme by 1 December. We also stressed the need for Iraq to comply with the relevant Security Council</P>
    <P>resolutions.</P>
    <P>Ireland is, therefore, working to achieve support for proposals which will alleviate the humanitarian situation in Iraq, provide for the normalisation and development of the Iraqi economy for the benefit of that country, and to convince Iraq to accept fully its international obligations under the existing resolutions of the Security Council. These, when accepted, will result in the suspension of sanctions.</P>

      <P>The IDC-World Times information society index was initially cited in the 1996 report of the information society steering committee. It has been noted subsequently in the Information Society Commission's reports to Government. The index measures variables in 55 countries under the headings of computer, information, Internet and social infrastructures. In 1996, Ireland was placed in the third division in twenty-third position. The 2001 index ranked Ireland in the second division, in twentieth position out of the 55 countries surveyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its third report produced in December last, the outgoing Information Society Commission made a range of recommendations to Government in terms of taking the information society agenda forward. These recommendations emphasised the importance of taking ownership of information society issues at the highest level; of a strong co-ordination focus across Departments <Col N="328" /> and agencies; and of a high concentration on implementation and enforcement.</P>
    <P>Building on these recommendations, the Government agreed in June of this year on a range of measures to strengthen its approach to information society issues. Along with the appointment of a new Information Society Commission, these measures provide for the establishment of a Cabinet committee on the information society, and of a complementary e-strategy group at Secretary General level. These new structures are designed to deliver a more coherent overall approach, at the highest level of Government, to formulation and implementation of policy on a wide range of issues that increasingly cut across traditional departmental boundaries.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has also begun an important benchmarking exercise under the eEurope initiative &ndash; including measuring progress with delivery of e-government services, which are increasingly being used internationally as a strong indicator of wider information society development. I have prioritised progress in this area, and have emphasised the importance of Ireland performing strongly in this EU exercise. It is encouraging in this context to note that Irish Government websites were recently rated best in the EU by the third Internet intelligence study, conducted by the Amsterdam-Maastricht Summer University in conjunction with PoliticsOnline.</P>
    <P>Ireland also performs strongly in the World Competitiveness Yearbook of the Swiss-based IMD. This ranks 49 industrialised and emerging economies using 286 different criteria in the areas of economic performance, government efficiency, business efficiency and infrastructure. Ireland is placed at seventh position in the 2001 rankings.</P>

      <P>The Government does not intend to introduce a price freeze in advance of the introduction of the <Col N="329" /> euro. Such a move would be unwarranted and undesirable.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has not provided any details that demonstrate an acceleration in the cost of living linked to the introduction of the euro. According to the latest statistics from the Central Statistics Office, released last Friday, consumer prices for September 2001 increased by 0.4% over the previous month. This increase was the same as that recorded for September 2000. The annual inflation rate remained unchanged at 4.6% in September 2001. On this basis there is no evidence to suggest that there is an upward movement of prices that can be attributable to the introduction of the euro.</P>
      <P>It should also be borne in mind that changes in prices do occur for various reasons and at different times during the trading year. In a competitive environment this is perfectly acceptable. What is unacceptable is that certain traders may seek to use the introduction of the euro as an opportunity to introduce unwarranted price increases. The ultimate sanction for those who do so should be loss of business. Successive Governments have recognised that the encouragement of a competitive environment and promotion of greater price awareness is a far better way of ensuring value for money for consumers than the imposition of price control. The introduction of the euro does not change this fact.</P>
      <P>The most effective way of minimising confusion for consumers and ensuring that the changeover to the euro does not lead to unwarranted increase in prices is to empower consumers to be vigilant in monitoring prices. This is the objective of dual display of prices. The key Government initiative to encourage dual display of prices has been the development of the national code on euro changeover. Retailers who subscribe to either the national code or to sectoral codes of practice on dual display approved by the Director of Consumer Affairs commit to displaying prices in both Irish pounds and euro at a minimum from 1 October 2001 to 9 March 2002. They also undertake to provide information in-store to help consumers understand the conversion to euro and to facilitate price comparison.</P>
      <P>Subscribers to the codes are entitled to display a special logo devised by the Director of Consumer Affairs as evidence of a commitment to implement the changeover fairly. Each subscriber has undertaken to provide a contact point for consumers who wish to complain if they do not believe they are being treated fairly. Should the matter not be resolved to the consumers' satisfaction they will be entitled to take the matter up with the Director of Consumers Affairs who has already indicated her intention to publicly &ldquo;name and shame&rdquo; any trader who displays the logo but fails to live up to the commitments involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Large numbers of organisations have already signed up to the codes of practice. I believe that this shows that they are anxious to carry out the changeover fairly and to be seen to do so. Consumers also need to be conscious of the power <Col N="330" /> that they themselves can exert in encouraging retailers to sign up to the codes by letting them know that they only intend to shop where they see the logo displayed.</P>

      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF, and following consultations with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain services currently provided by participants on community employment, CE, are being mainstreamed. The mainstreaming of schools services is currently under way and discussions with the Department of Health and Children on the mainstreaming of CE health services are proceeding. The possibility of mainstreaming certain environmental services currently provided under CE is also under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Services provided under CE for disabled persons are classified as a priority by FÁS and have <Col N="331" /> been protected from the phased reductions imposed on other categories of projects due to a restructuring of the programme in 1999. Audits of CE services undertaken in 1999, 2000 and 2001 showed an increase in the number of CE participants providing these services.</P>
    <P>The mainstreaming of health services will involve the transfer of CE funding from FÁS to the Department of Health and Children, and should place services such as personal assistants on a more secure footing. The centres for independent living will be included in this mainstreaming process. Such services will, after an appropriate transition period to allow CE participants work out their contracts, be solely the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children. Every effort will be made to ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>A small number of individuals continue to experience difficulties in getting jobs following their participation in CE due to barriers such as age, health, literacy, numeracy or a lack of suitable jobs locally. In recognition of this, I have recently introduced greater flexibility with regard to such participants, particularly in the case of older workers. FÁS now has discretion to offer a further period on the programme on a case-by-case basis for these participants. This flexibility does not apply to projects currently being mainstreamed, however, participants can be facilitated on other projects as vacancies arise.</P>

    <P>In the same year six new merchant vessels were added to the Irish ship register. The Government is actively seeking to expand the Irish flagged shipping sector and Irish seafarer employment in line with our development policy for the shipping industry and shipping services sector. To achieve that goal the Government has introduced a range of targeted fiscal reliefs in recent years: full refunds of employer's PRSI payments for seafarers; a special £5,000 income tax allowance for seafarers; concessions in the corporation tax area for shipping associated leases; and the introduction of a 12.5% rate of corporation tax for profits from shipping from 1 January 2001 instead of 1 January 2003, that is, two years ahead of schedule.</P>
    <P>Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners regarding the possible introduction of a tonnage tax for the shipping sector. In working to develop Irish based shipping and shipping services, my Department is able to call upon the services of the Irish Maritime Development Office &ndash; IMDO &ndash; the State's dedicated development agency for the shipping and shipping services sectors. The IMDO has been tasked to help my Department develop appropriate incentives and a marketing package to promote Ireland as a centre for shipping related businesses and for the registration of merchant ships.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our firm position that military action should be undertaken only as a means of last resort after all other means have failed. Regrettably, the Taliban regime, which controlled 90% of the territory of Afghanistan, refused over a period of two years to comply with the demands of the Security Council that it hand over Osama bin Laden and dismantle the terrorist camps in the area under its control. The Taliban maintained this position in the face of sanctions imposed by the Security Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even after the attacks of 11 September, in which more than 5,000 people died, the Taliban continued to reject the demands of the international community to surrender Mr. bin Laden and his associates. The US shares with all states the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence, recognised under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The US has suffered a vicious attack and it has every legitimate reason to believe that it may be the subject of further attacks planned and controlled by persons sheltered and sustained by the Taliban regime. Indeed, on 10 October and again subsequently, the Al Qaeda network issued further direct threats against the US and others. There can be little doubt that the actions now <Col N="339" /> being taken by way of self-defence against the Taliban are justified under international law, so long as the response remains both targeted and proportionate.</P>
    <P>The US and its allies can also cite justification under Security Council Resolution 1368. This resolution, which is binding on all members of the United Nations, calls on all states to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of the terrorist attacks of 11 September and stresses that those responsible for aiding, supporting or harboring the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of those acts will be held accountable. The Government has made clear that it supports the action of the US and its allies as long as such action is targeted, proportionate and that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties.</P>

      <P>The international aid community, including Ireland, has been providing essential emergency relief to Afghanistan for some time. Last October, Ireland Aid gave priority to Afghanistan as a then &ldquo;forgotten emergency&rdquo;. Earlier this year a package of £1.2 million in humanitarian relief was provided. More recently the Government announced a further £2.8 million in emergency assistance. A total of £4 million has thus been provided to Afghanistan since the start of this year.</P>
      <P>My colleague and Minister for State, Deputy O'Donnell, represented the Government at the meeting of EU Development Ministers in Brussels on 10 October which discussed how best to respond to the current crisis. Ireland also participated in the meeting of the Afghanistan Forum in Geneva on 5-6 October which brought together neighbouring countries and international donors in an effort to respond effectively to the humanitarian situation. The Government is working vigorously and pro-actively to help resolve the crisis in Afghanistan. Ireland has, in the lead-up to its presidency of the UN Security Council and during my recent round of meetings in Washington and New York, been to the forefront in ensuring that the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is given international priority. This is also reflected in the programme of work which Ireland is pursuing as presidency of the Security Council. We are engaged in ongoing, intense consultations with the key humanitarian and other actors in both New York and Geneva and with those who are delivering aid to the people of Afghanistan with our support.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy's question to refer to the Government's official development assistance programme, Ireland Aid, which is administered by my Department. Each year Ireland Aid receives and processes large numbers of funding applications from a broad range of organisations involved in development activities throughout the developing world. The principal categories of applicants are; Irish and international non-governmental organisations &ndash; NGOs; Irish missionaries and linked organisations; and a wide range of local community groups and NGOs in poor countries. Funding is also provided to NGOs through the Agency for Personal Service Overseas APSO and the National Committee for Development Education NCDE for development education activities.</P>
      <P>The primary channels for the disbursement of Ireland Aid funding, to the groups referred to above, is through the co-financing of development projects, which focus especially on addressing basic needs and reducing poverty. Funds are also provided for emergency and post-emergency rehabilitation assistance and for projects which promote and protect human rights and democratisation. The sectoral and geographic spread of this funding is extremely wide, with the majority of projects being funded throughout Africa, Asia and Latin America, covering all the main basic needs sectors, such as primary health care, basic education, water and sanitation, rural development and income generation.</P>
      <P>During 2000, Ireland Aid provided, directly and indirectly, funding of almost £25.5 million, in support of projects implemented by NGOs. Examples of Ireland Aid schemes which provided funds to NGOs in 2000 include: the main scheme of the NGO co-financing scheme, under which 178 project applications were considered and 119 projects were provided with funding of more than £3.3 million in total; and the emergency humanitarian assistance and emergency preparedness and post-emergency rehabilitation schemes under which 111 NGO project applications were assessed, with 72 being approved for total funding of more than £8.9 million. A detailed breakdown of all the individual projects funded, including details regarding country, agency, project details and the amount provided in each case, will be set out in the forthcoming Ireland Aid annual report for 2000 which is to be published shortly.</P>

      <P>Irish passports are issued only to persons who are Irish citizens by virtue of the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956, 1986 and 2001. Strict procedures are laid down in my Department for the issue of passports and these are rigorously followed by all issuing offices. All passport applications within the State must be certified by a member of the Garda Síochána. Internal procedures within the Passport Office ensure that applications go through a detailed checking procedure before issue. Applications made abroad are verified by embassy or consulate staff and in any cases of doubt are referred to the Passport Office in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Passport Office maintains regular contact with the Garda Síochána in relation to passport issuing procedures and, on occasions, refers suspicious cases to them for investigation. Overall, however, it has been found that the incidence of attempted fraud is very low. I am not aware of any recent instances of passports being issued by employees at embassies abroad without proper authority. If the Deputy has information of alleged passport fraud, I would invite him to provide it to me and I will have it investigated without delay.</P>

      <P>The situation in Afghanistan has been one of particular concern to Ireland and the international community for a long time. As I stated before the House in June, the situation in Afghanistan was extremely grim and has clearly deteriorated since then. The Government's priorities remain the <Col N="342" /> search for a process to bring about peace and stability in Afghanistan and the continuation of efforts to ease the humanitarian suffering of the Afghan people.</P>
      <P>Ireland, in its Presidency of the Security Council, is consulting at every level on the medium and long-term prospects for Afghanistan. In the days and weeks ahead, the major political forces within and outside Afghanistan will be required to demonstrate their support for a political process. This will only succeed with the reintroduction of appropriate UN humanitarian and civil structures on the ground. The appointment by the UN Secretary General this week of a special representative to Afghanistan, Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi, is very welcome and close contact is being maintained with him. Ambassador Brahimi has a long and distinguished career in the service of the UN and has overall authority for UN humanitarian and political efforts in Afghanistan. He will manage peacekeeping initiatives with a view to facilitating the establishment of a fully representative, multi-ethnic and broad-based Government and will initiate preparations to develop plans for the rehabilitation of Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>The Government has announced a £2.8 million grant aid package, the largest ever for a single emergency, to support the work of Irish NGOs and the main international agencies in responding to the crisis in Afghanistan. Combined with the £1.2 million emergency package already in place for Afghanistan this year, this brings the total assistance provided by Ireland Aid for Afghanistan in 2001 to £4 million.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>The Egyptian-Jordanian initiative on the Middle East peace process has been somewhat overtaken by developments such as the report of the Mitchell commission and the recommendations it contained. Both Egypt and Jordan remain centrally involved in the search for peace and have endorsed the proposals made by Senator Mitchell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has consistently supported the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including their right to an independent state. We recognise that a just and permanent solution to the problems of the region can only come about <Col N="343" /> by respecting this right of the Palestinians and the right of Israel to live at peace within secure borders. A first step towards achieving these aims must be a resumption of dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis on the basis of the immediate implementation of the Mitchell report. This dialogue should then proceed to address the complex issues involved in a final settlement. We recognise that settlement negotiations will require the support of the international community and are prepared to offer our own support to the extent of our possibilities.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Irish Family Planning Association of the study by MORI-UNFPA referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>The global population, which has now exceeded six billion, is putting immense pressure on developing countries, particularly in the urban areas of the poorest countries. In this context Ireland Aid is increasingly focusing attention on the provision of basic education and health care which we believe is the key to ensuring a stable world population. Ireland has sharply increased its support for the work of the United Nations population fund in recent years. Our contribution in 2000 increased by 50% over that of the previous year and this year our contribution has increased by over two-thirds of that in 2000. Furthermore, as part of our multi-annual budgetary planning, we have given indicative commitments for the next two years which will effectively result in a doubling of our current level of funding to $2 million by 2003. The rate of the increase in Irish support to UNFPA is, in fact, the highest among donor countries to the fund. The Deputy will agree that our record demonstrates both the importance we attach to this issue and our real commitment to dealing with it.</P>

      <P>Ireland, with its European Union partners, continues to monitor carefully the political dialogue between the ruling Frelimo party and the opposition Renamo parties and we have pledged to support the process of political and socio-economic transition in Mozambique.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main focus of Ireland's official overseas development assistance programme is on Africa. Of the £16.75 million &ndash; 21.27 million &ndash; provided by Ireland Aid in emergency relief and recovery assistance in 2000, £8.5 million &ndash; 10.79 million &ndash; went to Africa. Overall, 76% of the total overseas assistance provided by the Government during 2000 went to that continent. Ireland has formal development programmes in six African countries, namely, Lesotho, Zambia, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Uganda and Tanzania. This reflects not only development needs but also the long tradition of missionary and humanitarian engagement by Irish people throughout the continent.</P>
      <P>This strong African focus is proportionate to the spread of humanitarian crises, both naturally occurring and man-made, which continue to undermine progress and stability on our planet. These lie largely within the African continent. Protracted conflict, such as that in Angola, continues to have an enormous cost in human, social and development terms. Drought and flooding are also endemic in regions such as the Horn of Africa. Ireland and other members of the international donor community continue to reflect these realities and their impact on Africa in our emergency and development assistance programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In broader development terms, the picture is similar. Of the 48 countries classified as least developed by the United Nations, 33 are in sub-<Col N="345" /> Saharan Africa. The greatest concentration of extreme poverty &ndash; 46% of the population &ndash; is in sub-Saharan Africa. The continent is also under severe threat from the spread of HIV-AIDS which is decimating its population and reversing years of development effort. This too has been given priority in both national and international aid terms. The Government will continue to give Africa this level of priority both in its bilateral aid programmes and in its ongoing work with international partners in the EU, UN and other international fora.</P>

      <P>The situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia &ndash; FYROM &ndash; is a matter of concern to me and to my colleagues in the European Union and was discussed at the most recent meeting of the General Affairs Council on 8 October.</P>
      <P>The signature of the Ohrid Framework Agreement on 13 August was a significant step towards restoring peace and stability to that country. It established a parallel process whereby the armed Albanian extremist groups handed over their arms to the NATO &ldquo;Essential Harvest&rdquo; task force while the FYROM parliament voted on a set of changes to the constitution guaranteeing minority rights and multi-ethnic representation in the state institutions. The arms hand-over was completed on 26 September and the extremist Albanian armed groups announced their disbandment the next day. However, hardline opposition to the constitutional changes required by the framework agreement has resulted in a delay in the parliamentary process.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on 8 October the Council expressed its concern about the delay on the part of the FYROM Government in implementing the 13 August framework agreement. The Council stressed that the full and faithful implementation of all the constitutional and legislative provisions of the agreement by all the parties remains the only guarantee of a return to peace and stability in the country and made clear its expectation that all democratic forces in the country engage fully and constructively in the parliamentary process. The Council also called on the FYROM Government to take the necessary measures swiftly to find an effective solution to the problem of an amnesty for the former rebels.</P>
      <P>The EU will continue to monitor developments in FYROM in close co-ordination with the US, OSCE and NATO so as to ensure that the peace process can be maintained and the basis laid for long-term stability, reconciliation and development.</P>

      <P>Since the beginning of 2001 a total of £8,175,329 has been allocated in support of aid programmes in Asia. Irish Government emergency humanitarian and recovery assistance is provided on a bilateral basis by funding partners throughout Asia. Assistance is given to victims of humanitarian crises arising from conflicts and natural disasters. Emergency preparedness and post-emergency recovery assistance is also provided.</P>
      <P>The biggest recipient of assistance in Asia during the current year has been Afghanistan where the continuing humanitarian crisis has received a total of £4 million. India received a total of £1,253,000 for the Gujarat earthquake emergency and in response to flooding in Orissa State. A contribution of £575,000 was made to Tajikistan, and Mongolia received £100,000 in assistance. Ireland Aid also supported mine clearance programmes in Cambodia and Vietnam totalling £490,000. Bangladesh was allocated £139,000 for an emergency preparedness programme underlying Ireland's commitment to disaster preparedness initiatives. Other grants were paid to Iraq, Lebanon and a programme dealing with refugees on the Thai-Burmese border.</P>
      <P>East Timor is a priority for Ireland Aid assistance with an aid liaison office established in Dili in November 2000 and a total of £1.5 million being provided this year. For 2000 a total of £3,734,481 was provided in emergency and recovery assistance in Asia. East Timor was the biggest recipient of this assistance, receiving £1.27 million. Other programmes to receive humanitarian and recovery funding during 2000 were in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Georgia, India, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Lebanon, Mongolia, Palestine, Tajikistan, Thai-Burmese border and West Timor.</P>
      <P>Co-funding of NGOs and missionaries in Asia during 2000, amounted to £2,054,005. Provisional figures for 2001 indicate an increase in that amount. In 2000, the human rights and democratisation scheme supported six projects in the following countries: Bangladesh; Burma; East Timor; and India.

This assistance is made up of emergency aid, rehabilitation assistance, co-financing for NGOs and missionary orders and support for human rights and democratisation programmes.</P>
      <P>In 2000, emergency relief and recovery assistance totalling £1,377,659 was granted to the region. This included £150,015 granted to the Organisation of American States for a programme that reduces the vulnerability of poor rural communities in Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala to flooding. Emergency assistance was provided for Belize and Venezuela. Following the £1 million in rehabilitation assistance directed at Central America in 1999 to assist recovery from Hurricane Mitch, a further £796,000 was provided for ongoing and vital recovery programmes.</P>
      <P>So far this year a total of £1.4 million in humanitarian assistance has been granted to Latin America. This consists of emergency relief and recovery assistance to Colombia, El Salvador and Peru. A contribution of £100,000 was also made to the International Federation of the Red Cross pan-American disaster response unit. A total of £2,325,886 has been allocated to NGOs and missionary orders in Latin America in the last two years in the following countries: Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, El Salvador, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Paraguay.</P>
      <P>In 2000 a total of 14 projects were funded through the human rights and democratisation scheme in Latin America. These projects amounted to £563,828 and reached communities in Peru, Columbia, Haiti, Guatemala, Brazil and the Dominican Republic.

      <P>The £5.9 million provided by the Government in support of the vulnerable populations in Latin America during 2000-2001 represents a substantial humanitarian commitment which will continue to be reflected in the Ireland Aid programme.</P>

The United Nations observer mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo briefs the Security Council on events in the country on a regular basis. On 22 October the Council is due to consider the situation in the DRC in light of the most recent report of the Secretary General, which appeared yesterday. Ireland has consistently supported the Lusaka peace process and is actively involved in Security Council discussions on the matter. Two Irish military officers serve as observers with the UN mission.</P>
      <P>During a Security Council mission to the DRC in May Ireland's representative met with the DRC Minister for Human Rights and reiterated to him our concerns regarding human rights issues in the country. Of particular concern is the plight of children, many of whom are pressed into service in the various armies and militias present on the territory of the DRC. The Secretary General sent his special representative for children and armed conflict, Mr. Olara Otunnu, to the DRC in May. Mr. Otunnu advocated to all the parties to the conflict the needs of all war-affected children, especially child combatants. Ireland fully supports the Secretary General's efforts in this area.</P>

      <P>Developments in the western Balkans remain a high priority for the European Union. The situation in that region is monitored on an ongoing basis by the European Council's political and security committee and by the Council secretariat. Discussion of the situation is included on the agenda of almost every meeting of the General Affairs Council. At its most recent meeting on 8 and 9 October, Ministers discussed in particular the situation in the Former <Col N="350" /> Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia &ndash; FYROM, the forthcoming elections in Kosovo to be held on 17 November and relations between Serbia and Montenegro.</P>
      <P>In relation to FYROM, Ministers expressed their concern at the delay in the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement of 13 August and called on all democratic forces in the country to engage fully and constructively in parliamentary process in order to approve all the constitutional and legislative provisions of the agreement.</P>
      <P>On Kosovo, Ministers emphasised the need for a massive turnout for the elections on 17 November on the part of all communities in Kosovo. In particular, they called on the authorities in Belgrade to support the participation of Kosovo Serbs in the ballot to ensure that that community is appropriately and effectively represented in the newly democratic institutions. Ireland is actively participating in arrangements for the holding of these elections. We have already provided a long-term observer to the Council of Europe which is charged with monitoring the registration process and will be providing a further five short-term observers to monitor the voting process. A further 30 polling supervisors will be provided to the OSCE which has been charged with the actual conduct of the elections.</P>
      <P>The Ministers also stressed the importance of a constructive and substantive dialogue between the Belgrade and Podgorica authorities in order the decide on new constitutional arrangements acceptable to all parties for relations between the two republics, Serbia and Montenegro, which constitute the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. One year after the overthrow of Milosevic there is reason for cautious optimism for the future of the western Balkans. All of the countries of the region now have democratically elected Governments. An early intervention by the international community led by the EU has prevented a more serious outbreak of violence in FYROM, and the agreement of 13 August provides an opportunity for the different ethnic groups in that country to resolve their difficulties peacefully.</P>
      <P>The European Union remains committed to the region through the stabilisation and association process, the objective of which is to consolidate over time stability, democracy and the rule of law in the countries of the western Balkans, reflecting their status as potential candidates for membership of the EU. Ireland is also an active participant in the stability pact for south-eastern Europe through which we are funding a number of projects in the areas of local democracy, support for the media and refugee return.</P>

      <P>Ireland continues to monitor the situation in Rwanda carefully. The internal situation remains calm, although the situation in neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo has potential ethnic and security implications. Rwanda continues to maintain a military presence in the DRC, but it has been largely co-operative with the United Nations observer mission in the DRC, MONUC.</P>
      <P>The issue of the illegal exploitation of natural resources and mineral wealth in the DRC remains under consideration by the Security Council and the panel of experts which will report again to the Council in November. In the light of that report, the Security Council will consider what action may be necessary. Ireland will continue to work to promote democracy and freedom in Rwanda and to assist in the attainment of a just and lasting peace. We also fully support the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda, which aims to bring to justice those responsible for the genocide in 1994. Ireland has contributed over £13 million in assistance to Rwanda since 1994. The money has been spent predominantly in the emergency, rehabilitation and democratisation fields.</P>

      <P>In the context of my participation in meetings of the General Affairs Council and of the European Council, and also during bilateral meetings, I have had regular discussions with my EU ministerial counterparts on European security and defence policy as it has developed in accordance with the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty and relevant European Council conclusions.</P>
      <P>Throughout these discussions it has been indicated that any military involvement of more than 12 armed personnel by Ireland in a Petersberg Task would be on the basis of a sovereign decision by the Irish Government as well as being subject to a UN mandate being in place and approval by Dáil Éireann as required by relevant Irish legislation. These points are accepted by our EU partners.</P>
      <P>Ireland's ongoing participation in the development of European security and defence policy is fully consistent with our policy of non-membership of military alliances and our commitment to international peace and security. I have made no requests for assistance from other EU member states in the areas mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Government is very concerned that all possible steps are taken to ensure that official aid reaches the poorest of the poor. Our programme is delivered through a number of channels directly via bilateral co-operation through multilateral agencies, NGOs and partner organisations.</P>
      <P>The evaluation and audit unit of Ireland Aid leads a rigorous system of internal and external evaluation, for example, the OECD, to ensure that this aid is reaching the beneficiaries and that programmes are performing to expectations while giving value for money.</P>
      <P>The target of reducing poverty is reflected both in the choice of Ireland Aid priority countries, all of which are among the poorest of the poor, and in the heavy concentration of the bilateral aid programme which addresses the real needs of the poor such as basic education, health, including a strong HIV-AIDS component, water and sanitation, agriculture, rural roads and the promotion of good governance.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that this question refers to the terrible events which took place in the United States on 11 September and their global implications. Details of the Government's response to these events have been provided separately in my replies to the relevant oral and written questions, also taken today. As outlined in those replies, the £2.8 million emergency aid package announced by the Government in response to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and on its borders was divided equally between NGOs and international agencies. The extent of this package reflects the gravity of the current crisis. It brings the total assistance provided for Afghanistan this year to £4 million. The scale of this humanitarian commitment and the support it represents for NGOs in the field are self-evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish aid agencies have been receiving increased funding from the Government over several years now and this trend is set to continue. This increase is also a natural outcome of Ireland's commitment to reach the UN 0.7% of GNP target for overseas development assistance by 2007. Taking the main Irish NGOs by way of example, GOAL received £2.5 million in direct <Col N="354" /> support from Ireland Aid in 2000 and has received over £3 million so far this year. Concern received £3.8 million in 2000 with £4.12 million provided so far this year. Trócaire received £2.6 million in 2000 with £3.4 million this year to date. This funding is provided by the Government not only in the form of emergency relief and recovery support, but also in the form of block grants and support for other areas such as human rights and democratisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is totally opposed to the continued operation and any expansion of the Sellafield plant. Since taking office I have spared no effort in making known to the relevant UK Ministers, both in face to face meetings and in correspondence, the concerns of the Irish Government about Sellafield in general and also specifically about MOX.</P>
      <P>I need hardly remind this House of the Government's dismay and anger at the announcement last week by the UK Government that it has given the go ahead to the Sellafield mixed oxide or MOX fuel fabrication plant. At a time of heightened tensions around the world arising from terrorist threats and when one would have expected countries with nuclear installations to consider the very real threat to safety and security, I find the UK Government's decision, which will effectively result in an expansion of operations at Sellafield, difficult to comprehend.</P>
      <P>The opening of the MOX plant will mean that the Irish Sea is used as a highway for the transport of highly dangerous nuclear fuel to and from nuclear plants around the world. This is in addition to the existing and equally unacceptable activities at Sellafield. The Taoiseach has personally conveyed to the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, the Government's implacable opposition to the decision to proceed with the MOX plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I have written to both the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for Health reiterating our opposition to the MOX plant and calling upon the UK Government to suspend with immediate effect the authorisation of the MOX plant and to take the necessary steps to halt, also with immediate effect, all transportation of radioactive materials in and around the Irish Sea to <Col N="355" /> and from the MOX plant. I have also informed them that we will be deciding on further legal actions under EU and-or UN law in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to raise the question of nuclear safety at Sellafield in appropriate EU, UN and other international fora as well as in appropriate bilateral contacts. I am asking my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to consider your suggestions and, if possible and appropriate, to raise our concerns in those fora.</P>

As regards the timescale for completion, I understand from Aer Rianta that the company lodged the necessary planning application with Cork County Council in August. Consideration of this application is expected to take about three months.

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that Ireland is ranked 20th out of 30 countries in a survey of leading information societies (details supplied); and the plans the Government has to ensure the improvement of Ireland's position in this important sector.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the source referred to by the Deputy which is a year 2000 report. A year is a long time in the Internet world. Initiatives have been ongoing throughout the life of this Government to ensure Ireland's place as a premier information society.</P>
      <P>This progress has been gauged in more recent surveys. A current survey by Accenture in 25 countries concludes that &ldquo;the Irish Government can take a measure of pride in the finding that 65% of Irish executives believe that it is an exemplar of e-commerce. This was the most positive response in all of the 25 nations surveyed.&rdquo;  Recent telecommunications benchmarking surveys conclude that Ireland is third in competitiveness for international leased lines among 13 OECD countries surveyed.</P>
      <P>In 2000 the Oireachtas passed the Electronic Commerce Act. The main purpose of the legislation is to create equivalence under the law between electronic documents and physical documents. There are provisions dealing with electronic writing, electronic signatures, retention of electronic documents, concluding electronic contracts and the admissibility of electronic evidence in the courts. These provisions help remove any current legal uncertainties surrounding electronic transactions and communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Access to all the new information and communications technologies, such as the Internet, is crucial to our development as a fully inclusive information society. New technology has the potential to increase opportunities for everybody to participate in our society and economy. In December 2000, I launched the CAIT &ndash; community application of information technology &ndash; initiative which is aimed at opening the world of new technology and information systems to those in our society who are unfamiliar with and do not use the new technologies in their everyday lives. <Col N="358" /> CAIT intends to harness the experience, local knowledge and relationships of the community and voluntary sector to implement demonstration projects which achieve this aim. Some £4 million has been provided for this purpose over the period July 2001 to December 2002.</P>
    <P>A total of 71 projects were recommended for funding. These projects will impact on every county in Ireland and on a wide range of groups, including rural communities, the farming community, the elderly, the unemployed, manual workers, the Traveller community, people with disabilities and young people at risk. Under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, a sum of 26 million euros was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Some 13 broadband projects which rolled out nationwide were supported and have been completed in the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>The figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to 200 million euros. A first call for proposals was run last year and, on foot of submissions received, I signed contracts at the beginning of the year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. A further call for proposals is under way.</P>

      <P>In so far as my role as Minister for Defence is concerned, the criteria for the use of EU capabilities to carry out humanitarian and crisis management tasks have their basis in the provisions of the Treaty on European Union and have been elaborated in the conclusions of successive European Councils since Cologne.</P>
      <P>A decision by the EU to undertake a humanitarian or crisis management task would be taken by the Council of the European Union, which would have the responsibility and overall direction for any EU-led humanitarian or crisis management operation &ndash; Petersberg tasks. In the context of the objective of achieving the EU headline goal, otherwise known as the rapid reaction force, by 2003, the EU has not yet reached the state of preparedness to undertake a</P>
      <P>Petersberg task.</P>
      <P>The voluntary nature of participation by EU member states in any Petersberg task is a key principle in the development of European security and defence policy. A decision for any EU member state to participate in a particular EU-led Petersberg operation will be taken by that member state on a sovereign basis in accordance with their internal procedures. Participation in any potential EU Petersberg operation, in keeping with the Government's stated position in this area, will be considered on a case by case basis and Ireland will only participate in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993. The decisions taken by individual member states will subsequently be confirmed through the framework of the European Council.</P>
      <P>Planning work is ongoing in relation to developing the capabilities required to meet the headline goal by the target date of 2003. A capabilities improvement conference is scheduled to take place on 19 and 20 November 2001 in order to review progress to date and to address any shortfalls which have been identified. While certain informal figures have been used for planning purposes, no formal geographic limit has been established for the deployment of EU crisis management capabilities. There have been no specific decisions taken by the EU on the points raised by the Deputy in relation to the geographical scope of the so-called rapid reaction force.</P>
      <P>Finally, the provision of information for citizens regarding possible deployment of EU crisis management capabilities is generally regarded by member states as being primarily a matter for national governments. In Ireland's case the Government has made considerable efforts to facilitate thorough and factually-based debate on Ireland's participation in the development of European security and defence policy. It is intended that every effort should be made to keep people informed of ongoing developments in this area in the period ahead.</P>

      <P>A review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted has taken place. The attacks on the US have clearly changed the context for such emergency planning. Since the 1980s the emphasis in planning was on peacetime emergencies, whereas now we are faced with new threats arising from global terrorism. In these circumstances, the Government has decided to set up an office of emergency planning in the Department of Defence. The new office will take the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threat from international terrorism and from any escalation in international tensions, including co-ordination of the responses by the various agencies involved, and exercise an oversight role in relation to peacetime planning in order to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements. The existing lead role of Departments in respect of specific emergency planning arrangements will of course continue. I am, accordingly, the Cabinet Minister with responsibility for the foregoing.</P>
      <P>While there is in place an extensive framework of peacetime emergency plans, it is now clear that the basis on which emergency planning is currently carried out needs to be reviewed to take into account the possibility, however remote, of chemical and biological attacks on this State and its people or on neighbouring countries which could indirectly impact on this State. The lead responsibility for specific emergency planning functions will remain with the relevant Departments, and the high level contact group established in the wake of the events of 11 September will in future be convened by the Department of Defence to support the office of emergency planning. The operation of similar bodies in other jurisdictions is being examined to establish best international practice.</P>

      <P>The concerns of the Government in relation to Sellafield are well known to the House. A dominant theme <Col N="361" /> of the Government's campaign against Sellafield has been the genuine fear of an accident at the site. The risk of a serious incident has now become more acute in the light of the horrific events of 11 September. These terrible events have highlighted new security risks and underline the responsibility of those countries with nuclear installations to protect such installations from attack. Those countries have an absolute duty to do everything possible to protect these installations from attack, and the protection of Sellafield is, of course, a matter for the British authorities. The Defence Forces will, as a matter of course, assist the Garda Síochána in preventing any potential threat to the Sellafield facility from this State or from Irish territorial waters.</P>

      <P>An EU standard is in place to guarantee that water intended for human consumption is safe. To this end thresholds have been set for the presence in water of active substances, including triazines. Monitoring undertaken in France showed that the content of atrazine and related substances in ground and surface water substantially exceeded the permitted thresholds and prompted the French authorities to impose a ban on use of atrazine and other triazine herbicides from September 2002.</P>
      <P>Monitoring work undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, indicated no contamination of surface or ground water with triazine compounds in Ireland. In Ireland simazine and atrazine are the two most commonly used triazine herbicides. Simazine is used for weed control around fruit trees, soft fruit plantations and ornamentals. The main use of atrazine is for weed control in maize, a crop that is grown on only a limited scale here. Simazine and atrazine are the subject of ongoing comprehensive reviews at EU level. The reviews include detailed risk assessments in relation to effects on human and animal health and impact on the environment. On completion of the EU reviews the Department will consider what action, if any, needs to be taken.</P>

      <P>In 1997 a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
      <P>The new area-based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped lowland £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped lowland £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; mountain type land £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named has been paid a total of £1,603.85 under the area-based compensatory allowance scheme in respect of 35.64 hectares of mountain type land at £45 per hectare. As the amount paid was greater than his average headage payment of £1,046 over the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, no compensation for loss under the area-based scheme is due. The scheme is currently under review with a view to finding the most equitable arrangements with particular reference to farmers with mountain type land.</P>

      <P>Measures developed over the past decade to deal with scrapie include compulsory notification, the banning in 1990 of feeding meat and bone meal to ruminants, including sheep, the strengthening of controls on feed mills in 1996, the banning of specified risk materials from cattle and sheep in 1997, active surveillance involving testing at factories since 1998, and an ongoing programme of research in areas such as strain typing, breed susceptibility and geographical distribution. In addition, the potential for effective monitoring and control in this area has been significantly enhanced by the implementation since June 2001 of the national sheep identification system &ndash; NSIS &ndash; which involves the individual identification and traceability of the entire national flock.</P>
      <P>As with all animal health issues, my Department will continue to keep these controls under review, and should new scientific research emerge which may indicate the desirability of adjusting or augmenting them, my Department will take any action that may be necessary at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>The investigation into the person named is still continuing and involves members of An Garda Síochána and my Department's special investigation unit. The search of this person's premises arose as a result of an investigation into suspected illegal cattle trading and manipulation of bovine identification on the part of a number of individuals throughout the country. The reasons for the search of this person's premises were outlined on the search warrant that was produced on the day of the search. I understand that some documents that were seized have been returned and any documents and other evidence that have been retained are currently being examined and may be used by my Department and the Garda in the further course of their investigation and possible subsequent prosecutions.</P>

      <P>The amount of early retirement pension payable is based on the amount of land released into the scheme by a retiring farmer. The person named released 32.98 hectares of land into the scheme which entitled him to the maximum rate of pension, £9,509.84, 12,075. It is a requirement of the early retirement scheme and of the Council regulation under which it was introduced that any national retirement pension to which a participant becomes entitled must be offset against his or her early retirement pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named became entitled to the non-contributory old age pension from 2 January 1998 and my Department made adjustments to his early retirement pension on the basis of the information received at that point. On 11 June 2001 my Department received notification from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs of variations in his old age pension entitlements over the intervening period, and appropriate adjustments were made to his early retirement pension which resulted in the recoupment from <Col N="367" /> his July 2001 payment of a small net overpayment of £11.43. He is now receiving his full entitlement from my Department. The early retirement pension is subject to deduction of the appropriate level of income tax as notified to my Department by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

This is the earliest possible date permitted under the relevant EU regulations. I had been seeking an increased advance payment this year and I am happy to say that last Friday, the European Commission agreed to allow for an increase in the advance payment this year from 60% to 80%. The regulation permitting this increase must be published in the Official Journal before payments can commence. I expect that this regulation will be published early next week and advance payments under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme will commence as soon as this happens. Increasing the advance payment to 80% will mean some £80 million in additional payments to beef farmers under the various cattle premium schemes between now and the end of December.</P>

      <P>In recent days confirmation has been received from the Polish authorities of an easement of their import restrictions, particularly in relation to live pigs and boar, raw meat, offal, giblets, pork and wild boar meat products not processed at a temperature of over <Col N="373" /> 72ºC, raw pig-wild boar skin, semen and embryos of the above species and all inedible products not processed at a temperature of over 72ºC. Unfortunately the import ban on bovine meat from Ireland still remains in place. With specific reference to the company referred to by the Deputy, which is involved in the export of lambskins to Poland, I understand that difficulties that had arisen in regard to this matter have been resolved and that the export trade has resumed.</P>

      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in <Col N="378" /> sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
      <P>The new area-based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped lowland £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped lowland £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; mountain type land £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The scheme is currently under review with a view to finding the most equitable arrangements with particular reference to farmers with mountain type land.</P>

      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently iden<Col N="380" /> tified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
      <P>The new area-based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped lowland £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped lowland £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; mountain type land £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named was paid £591.77 on 25 September 2001 in respect of 13.15 hectares of mountain type land at £45 per hectare. As the amount paid was greater than his average headage payment of £400 over the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, no compensation for loss under the area-based scheme is due. The scheme is currently under review with a view to finding the most equitable arrangements with particular reference to farmers with mountain type land.</P>

      <P>The reason that no area-based compensatory payment has been made is that there is a problem with the area aid application from the person named. A parcel claimed by the person named is part of a commonage on which a cumulative overclaim has arisen. The area aid unit is currently seeking to clarify of a number of applicants the correct entitlements to this commonage. It is hoped to have this exercise completed shortly. No payments can issue until this problem has been resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the tax treatment of approved share option schemes rather than approved profit sharing schemes or save as you earn schemes. The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they have received 49 applications for approval under the amended tax treatment of share options and one scheme has been approved to date.</P>
      <P>An individual is normally chargeable to income tax on the gain between the allocation of a share option and its exercise and to capital gains tax on any gain between the time the option is exercised and the shares sold. Under the new arrangements provided for in Finance Act, 2001, for schemes meeting certain conditions, employees will now be chargeable to capital gains tax on the full gain, that is the difference between the amount paid for the shares and the amount received on disposal of the shares.</P>
      <P>To qualify for approval by the Revenue Commissioners, schemes must be open to all employees and full-time directors and must provide that they be eligible to participate in the scheme on similar terms. The scheme may, however, contain a &ldquo;key employee&rdquo; element where options can be granted without the similar terms conditions. In such a case, no more than 30% of the total number of shares over which rights are granted under the scheme in any year can be used in the key employee element. Therefore, 70% of the shares must be available for the all employee element of the scheme. Employees cannot participate in both elements in the same year. To qualify for the new tax treatment, there is a requirement that the period between the date of the grant of the option and the date of any subsequent sale of shares must be at least three years.</P>
      <P>Subject to certain conditions, tax relief is available where options are exercised on or after 15 February 2001, but before the scheme is approved by the Revenue Commissioners. Such schemes must be approved by Revenue before 31 December 2001 and may qualify provided at the time of both the grant and exercise, if prior to approval, the scheme would have been capable of being approved had the legislation been in force from the time the right was obtained. As with all tax reliefs, I will monitor the operation of this scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department does not provide funding directly to any organisations such as the Irish seal sanctuary. While the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has primary responsibility for dealing with wildlife, I understand it sees its responsibility as conservation of wildlife. I am informed that as the work of the Irish seal sanctuary does not impact significantly on overall seal numbers and is primarily of a welfare nature, involving the rehabilitation of individual seals, it does not come within that remit.</P>
      <P>I am aware that submissions for grant aid have been made by the Irish seal sanctuary on a number of occasions. At present, the various pre-budget submissions are being considered; it is not the practice to divulge any of the detailed content of the budget in advance. Hence it is not possible to give specific commitments on the provision of funding for any particular organisation prior to budget day. I assure the Deputy that I have noted the case made on behalf of the Irish seal sanctuary and it will be considered along with the many other pre-budget requests I have received.</P>

      <Quest>if the amount of money received by the Exchequer in VAT payments from the sale of new houses at the end of the third quarter for the year 2001 and for each of the full years for the past five years; the amount of stamp duty received by the Revenue Commissioners to date and for each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As VAT figures are not required to be completed in a manner which identifies the yield from the supply of certain goods or services all the figures in respect of VAT are estimated. In addition, the figure in respect of 2001 is based on 75% of the projected yield from the 2001 VAT base. The estimated figures as sought by the Deputy are as follows 1996, £216.38 million &ndash; 274.75 million; 1997, £291.64 million &ndash; 370.31 million; 1998, £391.72 million &ndash; 497.38 million; 1999, £507.84 million &ndash; 644.82 million; 2000, £654.64 million &ndash; 831.22 million; and 2001 &ndash; to 30 September 2001 &ndash; £568.07 million &ndash; 721.30 million.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that stamp duty data is not collected in a manner which allows for precise details of the stamp duty yield from the sale of new or second-hand houses. The approximate stamp duty yield from new houses and second-hand houses &ndash; including apartments &ndash; for the years 1996 to 2000, and the first nine months of this year, is estimated as follows:</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the rates and exemptions thresholds for second-hand houses were changed in mid 2000 which would effect the comparison.</P>

      <P>The Mount Street crèche is operated by the Civil Service crèche co-operative. In accordance with the Government's policy of providing increased child care facilities, substantial public funds have been made available to assist the co-operative in refurbishing the premises and running the crèche. For the past year a private sector company has been engaged by the co-operative to provide child care services in the Mount Street crèche. The care now being provided for children in Mount Street by the co-operative and the company involved is of the highest standard.</P>
      <P>I have reviewed the position of part-time employees and I am satisfied that the present arrangement is reasonable. The financial position of the crèche depends on a weekly rate being charged in respect of each place in the crèche. Where places are taken by the children of part-time staff, it is essential to the viability and the future operation of the crèche that the remaining period is also used by other part-time staff. I know the provider assists part-time staff who are looking for crèche partners. The rates charged in the Mount Street crèche are below those in similar crèches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1984 the Government approved a framework for a co-ordinated response to major emergencies. The purpose was to establish common procedures in each of the front-line emergency services for activating emergency plans and co-ordination, control and co-operation during peacetime emergencies.</P>
      <P>Each of the health boards has an emergency plan, which is based on this framework. The plan, which is essentially an ambulance service emergency plan, dovetails with the emergency plans of the other emergency services, that is, local authorities and the Garda. The plan can be activated by any one of these three sectors. In the case of the health services, the ambulance controllers notify designated hospitals in the health board area when the plan is activated.</P>
      <P>At hospital level the emergency plan is designed to deal with the receipt of patients in the event of the occurrence of a major disaster. The aim is to ensure that hospitals are in a position to mobilise all necessary and available resources and to utilise these to the best advantage so that the resulting response is appropriate, structured, co-ordinated and effectively managed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the recent tragic events in the United States, the chief executive officers of the health boards are establishing a national group to <Col N="395" /> review all aspects of major emergency planning in the health context. This review will inform the need for any revision to the existing plans.</P>
    <P>At my request, an expert group has also been established to develop a contingency plan to deal with a biological attack. The basic structures are already in place at both regional and national level. These include the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the Virus Reference Laboratory at national level and the departments of public health at regional level. A high level containment facility is currently under construction at the Virus Reference Laboratory and a computerised infectious disease reporting system is currently being developed to provide enhanced surveillance. Ireland forms part of the EU network on communicable disease, which is concerned with surveillance, early warning and responses to communicable disease threats. The committee is examining the extent to which these arrangements may need to be enhanced to deal with the possibility of biological attack. The committee has also identified a number of short-term targets which are central to developing a plan to deal with a secondary biological threat.</P>
    <P>With regard to a nuclear incident, the role of the health services under the national nuclear emergency plan relates primarily to the following areas: determining health problems and issuing of medical advice; provision of medical services at designated hospitals for contaminated persons including whole body monitoring; provision of ambulance services to transport injured persons to hospitals; collecting food samples for analysis by the Radiological Protection Institute; seizure and destruction of contaminated milk and foodstuffs; and stocking and distribution of stable iodine tablets should this be necessary. Ingestion of iodine tablets may be effective in preventing thyroid cancer in certain populations, especially children exposed to radioactive fallout. Whether or not iodine tablets would be necessary or of any value would be depend upon the level of radiation reaching any given area in Ireland and the type of radioactive material released. My Department is finalising the necessary arrangements for the purchase and distribution of new stocks of iodine tablets.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to subject medicinal products containing St. John's Wort &ndash; hypericum perforatum &ndash; to prescription-only status was taken following a recommendation from the Irish Medicines Board, which is the competent authority in this country for the assessment and licensing of medicinal products. The safety concerns identified by the board included effects of the product itself such as the potential for interaction with other medication &ndash; namely, cyclosporin, the contraceptive pill, warfarin, digoxin and theophylline &ndash; and hypersensitivity to sunlight. In addition, the board was concerned that St. John's Wort was being widely advertised for the treatment of depression and openly sold in many outlets for this purpose. The board considered that the treatment of such a condition should be under medical supervision and that self-diagnosis and self-medication were inappropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a submission from the Health Products Alliance, the IMB reviewed its decision concerning St. John's Wort and subsequently advised my Department that there were no grounds for changing its recommendation. Further evidence subsequently emerged confirming the board's concerns in this matter, and a number of other national regulatory authorities also issued warnings in regard to these products, including the Food and Drugs Administration in the United States, the European Medicines Evaluation <Col N="397" /> Agency of the European Union and the Medicines Control Agency in the United Kingdom, which published its concerns regarding the potential of St. John's Wort to interact with other commonly prescribed medicines. In light of the foregoing, and in the interests of protecting public health, I have no plans to alter the current regulatory position regarding products containing St. John's Wort.</P>
    <P>The debate concerning traditional medicinal products served to alert the public to the fact that &ldquo;natural&rdquo; does not always equate with safety where medicinal products are concerned. The number of traditional medicinal products on the market is increasing and the fact that they are largely unlicensed and not thus subject to control is a matter of concern.</P>
    <P>The debate on traditional medicinal products has also highlighted the lack of a common approach at EU level to the regulation of these products. While the matter is being addressed by a working group set up by the EU Pharmaceutical Committee in 1999, it is not anticipated that there will be an early resolution to the significant lack of harmonisation in this area. In recognition of these difficulties I asked my Department and the Irish Medicines Board to investigate the possibility of developing an interim licensing system for traditional use medicinal products which would allow such products to be lawfully marketed in this country.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board has recently submitted the final draft chapters of its report in the matter to the Department and has advised that it proposes placing the final proposals on the board's website to allow public comment on the matter. The final draft report will be submitted to me by the board on the completion of this final consultation process.</P>

My Department, in the context of its participation in the joint review group on psychology services in the health service along with health service employers and IMPACT, has been working to ensure adequate post-graduate training places. A work force planning exercise carried out under the aegis of the review recommended the provision of approximately 30 additional post-gradu<Col N="398" /> ate training places in psychology. Following a competitive bidding process, these additional places are being provided in the current year through the Psychological Society of Ireland's post-graduate diploma course. It is intended, subject to the availability of appropriate resources, to support a similar process to maintain this increased level of training places next year, in respect of which University College Galway will again be invited to participate.</P>

      <P>Arrangements under EU regulations supersede the provisions of the Irish eligibility system in respect of certain categories of nationals of other <Col N="400" /> EU countries. Social security pensioners of other EU countries who are not covered by an Irish social welfare pension, as recipient or dependant, and who are not employed or self-employed here, receive a medical card. Persons resident here who are insured workers in the territory of another EU country receive a medical card. Unemployed persons seeking work here who are covered by a form E119 issued by another EU country receive a medical card. The dependants of any of the above categories also receive a medical card provided that they, or, in the case of children, the spouse or person looking after them, are not employed or self-employed here.</P>
      <P>Students from other EU countries are entitled to a medical card if a form E128 has been issued by the country concerned. Alternatively, they may receive urgent necessary treatment free of charge if covered by form E111 or by producing evidence of UK residence. Where the duration of the course is at least one academic year, the student may apply for eligibility under the Irish system in which case he-she would be regarded as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Posted workers, namely, persons assigned to Ireland by an employer in another EU country, are covered by EU form E128. This form entitles the holder to full medical treatment in any EEA country for any condition, whether or not it is of an emergency nature. It covers employed and self-employed workers and family dependants accompanying the worker abroad who are temporarily posted to another European Economic Area, EEA, member state and continue to pay insurance contributions in the country of origin.</P>
      <P>Where none of the above arrangements applies, a national of another EU country who is employed or self-employed in Ireland has, under EU regulations, the same entitlements as an employed or self-employed Irish national. He-she and his-her dependants, if resident here, should, therefore, have either full or limited eligibility, as appropriate, regardless of the duration of residence in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million, 6.729 million, has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million, 4.698 million, is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million, 2.971 million, this year for orthodontic services of which £1.61 million, 2.044 million, was for the orthodontic initiative.</P>
      <P>The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised me of the following developments in the South Western Area Health Board &ndash; SWAHB &ndash; in relation to its initiative to improve its orthodontic services: a second consultant orthodontist has been appointed to the SWAHB; a manager to manage the orthodontic service in the board has been appointed and the successful candidate has taken up duty; a competition to fill the post of dental hygienist in the board will be organised in the near future; a competition in respect of dental surgery assistant posts in the board will be organised in the near future; the previously vacant post of superintendent radiographer at the regional orthodontic unit in St. James's Hospital has been filled; the equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit is almost complete and is now operational; validation of existing waiting lists is currently in progress; and agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics and two dentists for the SWAHB have commenced their training. I am also informed by the chief executive officer of the ERHA that at the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were 3,288 patients in orthodontic treatment in the authority.</P>

      <P>It has been the policy of my Department for a number of years to endeavour to meet identified needs in existing services, in addition to putting in place new services to support both adults and children with autism and those with an intellectual disability. This would include the enhancement of access to a range of support services, such as social work, psychology and other allied health services. In recent years, the level of investment in both new and existing services by this Government has, as the Deputy is aware, increased significantly, with additional revenue funding amounting to £76.7 million, 97.389 million, made available to the services in the last two years. This included nearly £7 million, 8.888 million, to meet identified needs in existing services. In addition to providing an enhanced level of funding to meet these needs, my Department is also working with the relevant educational and professional bodies to introduce measures which include short, medium and long-term strategies to deal with specific staffing needs across a spectrum of professions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allowed for the assessment of the capacity of adult sons and-or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care was deleted from 1 January 1999. As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision.</P>
      <P>A group representing the Department, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority was established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. This group has recently issued its recommendations as to how this issue should be progressed and all boards will be advised accordingly in the very near future. However, as the Deputy can appreciate, the issue of making payments is a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I am hopeful that payments will be made in the very near future.</P>
      <P>The nursing homes subvention scheme is administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £90, £120 and £150, the euro equivalents of which are 114.28, 152.37 and 190.46 &ndash; in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No 3) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the Deputy that funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly in recent years. When this Government came to office in 1997, the funding for the scheme was £27.8 million, 35.3 million. By 2000 that figure had risen to £38.479 million, 48.86 million. An additional £14 million, 17.78 million, has been made available for 2001, bringing the total available for the scheme this year to £52 million, 66.03 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to develop proposals in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review, the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993. In the meantime, my Department will continue to liaise with all the health boards on a regular basis during the remainder of 2001 in relation to the operation of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. Under the Health Act, 1970, a child is eligible for orthodontic treatment on the basis of defects noted at a school health examination carried out while the child is attending national school. There is no application process <i>per se</i> as children in specific classes in national school, usually in second, fourth and sixth class, are dentally screened and referred for orthodontic review as necessary.</P>

An additional investment of £5.3 million, 6.729 million, has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million, 4.698 million, is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The Mid-Western Health Board, MWHB, has been allocated an additional £529,000, 671,000, this year for orthodontic services of which £404,000, 513,000, was for the orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board proposes to recruit additional staff and validate its orthodontic waiting lists. In addition, my Department recently approved a proposed scheme from the MWHB to engage the services of private orthodontists to treat patients.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the chief executive officer of the MWHB that at the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were 1,408 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board and the number of patients awaiting orthodontic treatment in its area of responsibility was as follows:</P>

    <P>Patients are referred for secondary care orthodontic treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department that prioritise need for treatment based on the degree of handicap and severity of malocclusion. Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients but have a definite need of treatment and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 308 and 309 together.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable &ndash; £90, £120 and £150, with euro equivalents of 114.28, 152.37 and 190.46, in accordance with three levels of dependency &ndash; medium, high, maximum &ndash; which are eligible for subvention. The new rates represent a 25% increase, and were introduced on 1 April last.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in the Southern Health Board area is that the board has received a significantly increased number of claims from patients for enhanced payments in accordance with Articles 22.3 and 22.4. It is a matter for the board to determine the extent to which it can meet such claims consistent with its requirement to live within its overall revenue allocation and taking account of the fact that such enhanced payments are discretionary. However, in the interest of avoiding hardship to individual patients, my Department has been in regular contact with the board in an effort to find a solution which would take cognisance of the considerations outlined above. Pro<Col N="410" /> gress has been made to meet the most immediate individual problems and discussions are continuing in an effort to reach agreement on a more long-term approach to the issue.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, I received a request for a meeting from the Southern Health Board in July 2001. A response issued from my office indicating my regret at my unavailability at that time but stating that officials from my office would contact the board to set up a meeting in the future. A further letter was received from the board in September. It is still my intention that, as previously advised, I will meet the Southern Health Board to discuss this issue. In the interim, officials from my Department have met representatives of the Southern Health Board and remain in regular contact with them. I am being kept fully informed of the situation. In the meantime, my Department will continue to liaise with all the health boards on a regular basis during the remainder of 2001 in relation to the operation of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 317 and 325 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, considerable developments have taken place in cancer care and treatment since the commencement of the implementation of the national cancer strategy in 1997. To date, over £60 million &ndash; 76.18 million &ndash; has been invested in developing cancer services. One of the major elements of the implementation of <Col N="414" /> the strategy was the introduction of a national breast screening programme.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in February 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. I will support BreastCheck in moving to national coverage as soon as is practicably possible, having regard, in particular, to the experience gained in putting phase one of the programme in place. BreastCheck is currently in consultation with the health boards, including the Southern Health Board, concerning the roll out of the programme nationwide.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is also aware, the provision of symptomatic breast cancer services in Cork is the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board in the first instance. This year £800,000 &ndash; 1.016 million &ndash; was allocated to the Southern Health Board for the development of symptomatic breast cancer services in its functional area in the context of the recommendations of the report of the sub-group of the National Cancer Forum.</P>

Variant CJD is confirmed by a pathological examination of brain tissue, which is always carried out post mortem.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 321 and 353 together.</P>
      <P>Private waiting list data is not routinely collected by my Department. Under the waiting list initiative which was introduced in 1993, dedicated funding is made available to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out in-patient waiting list procedures for public patients. In order to monitor the performance of health agencies under this initiative, my Department collects and evaluates public in-patient waiting list figures on a quarterly basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Southern Health Board has provided information to the Deputy in relation to public in-patient and out-patient waiting lists in its acute hospitals as at 30 June 2001 and the mix between public and private activity in its acute <Col N="416" /> hospitals for 2000. I also understand that the board, at its meeting on 3 September, agreed a motion to accept the report of their legal representatives advising that management could be in breach of consultants' common contract if information was released on consultants private practices without the individual consent of the consultants involved.</P>
    <P>In a more general context, I am not satisfied with the degree of transparency attaching to the public-private mix in public hospitals. This is one of the issues to be addressed in moving to a more equitable and patient centred health system in the forthcoming health strategy.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. Under the orthodontic initiative, my Department recently approved a proposed scheme from the Mid-Western Health Board to engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. The details of this scheme will be circulated shortly to the chief executive officers of the other health boards to facilitate similar arrangements with private specialist orthodontic practitioners in their boards. I am confident that the orthodontic initiative, combined with the structural changes being introduced into the public orthodontic services, will significantly increase the number of patients receiving orthodontic treatment.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to patients in counties Cork and Kerry is the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board &ndash; SHB &ndash; in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic <Col N="417" /> treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million, 6.729 million, has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million, 4.698 million, is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The SHB has been allocated an additional £938,000 1.191 million this year for orthodontic services of which £813,000, 1.032 million was for the orthodontic initiative as follows: recruit an additional two consultant orthodontists: following recent interviews, the board expects that a candidate for one of the positions will be recommended by the Local Appointments Commission; the development of a new orthodontic unit in Tralee for the provision of orthodontic services to Kerry and parts of west Cork; the development of a new regional orthodontic unit in the north side of Cork city for the provision of orthodontic services to north Cork; commission four additional orthodontic chairs in St. Finbarr's Hospital; and validate waiting lists.</P>
    <P>My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork dental school to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post will be invited shortly when the post is re-advertised by University College Cork. I am also informed by the chief executive officer of the SHB that at the end of the September 2001 quarter, there were 2,300 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer has also informed me that at the end of the September 2001 quarter, the numbers awaiting orthodontic assessment and treatment were as follows:</P>

    <P>Patients are referred for secondary care orthodontic treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department that prioritise need for treatment based on the degree of handicap and severity of malocclusion. Patients in category A require immediate treatment and include those with congenital abnormalities of the jaws such as cleft lip and palate, and patients with major skeletal discrepancies between the sizes of the jaws. <Col N="418" /> Patients in category B have less severe problems than category A patients but have a definite need of treatment and are placed on the orthodontic treatment waiting list. The breakdown of this data by county is not routinely collected by my Department. I have, therefore, asked the chief executive officer of the SHB to look into the matter and reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Medicinal Products (Control of Paracetamol) Regulations, 2001, were made by me on 12 April 2001 and came into force on 1 October 2001. The regulations were made on the recommendations of the National Drugs Advisory Board and its successor, the Irish Medicines Board and impose further restrictions on the sale of medicinal products containing paracetamol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the regulations prescribe the maximum pack sizes for products when sold in pharmacies and non-pharmacies; prescribe cautionary and warning statements which must appear on all packs; prohibit the sale of paracetamol products in automatic vending machines; prohibit the sale of paracetamol products in non-<Col N="420" /> pharmacy outlets when a second analgesic component is present; prohibit the sale of multiple packs of paracetamol in the course of a single transaction; and prohibit the sale of paracetamol products unless they are in blister packs or in other such equivalent form of packaging as may be specified in the relevant product authorisations. Exemptions are provided in the case of prescription medicines and medicines intended for export.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board gave particular consideration to the sale of medicinal products containing paracetamol in non-pharmacy outlets and recommended that:</P>
    <P>Emergency supplies of paracetamol as single ingredient preparations only should be available in non-pharmacy outlets with the following restrictions:</P>
    <P>The maximum pack size will be restricted to a total of 12 x 500mg tablets or the equivalent amount of paracetamol, packaged in single unit dose packs for adult use and 60ml (125mg/5ml) for liquid paediatric formulations. Only one pack should be supplied on each occasion of purchase.</P>
    <P>Included in these regulations, on the recommendation of the board, is the requirement that certain information be provided on the labelling of the products so as to inform users of the precautions to be taken in their use.</P>
    <P>The following statements, therefore, must appear clearly on the packaging of the medicinal product or, if there is no outer packaging, on its immediate packaging: &ldquo;Contains Paracetamol&rdquo;; &ldquo;Do not take any other paracetamol-containing products&rdquo;; &ldquo;Do not exceed the stated dose&rdquo;; &ldquo;Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of overdosage, even if you feel well. Please read the enclosed leaflet carefully.&rdquo;, in cases where a package leaflet is supplied with the product and the product is intended mainly for use in adults; &ldquo;Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of overdosage, even if the child seems well. Please read the enclosed leaflet carefully.&rdquo;, in cases where a package leaflet is supplied with the product and the product is intended mainly for use in children not over 12 years of age; and &ldquo;Immediate medical advice should be sought in the event of overdosage, because of the risk of irreversible liver damage.&rdquo;, in cases where no package leaflet is supplied with the product.</P>

      <P>The provision of health and personal social services, including personal assistance services, to people with physical and sensory disabilities is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards, in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Since the Government came into office in June 1997, funding for home support services, including personal assistance services, has been substantially increased. This year, additional ongoing funding of £5 million &ndash; 6.349 million &ndash; rising to £10 million &ndash; 12.697 million &ndash; in 2002, was allocated for the development of home support services, including personal assistance services. Of this funding, £2.5 million &ndash; 3.174 million &ndash; rising to £6 million &ndash; 7.618 million &ndash; in 2002, was allocated specifically for the development of personal assistance services. Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of services in the sector are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services. Voluntary sector service providers and consumers are represented on the co-ordinating committees.</P>
      <P>Certain voluntary organisations, such as the various centres for independent living, have used the FÁS community employment &ndash; CE &ndash; schemes as a means of providing a personal assistance service to their clients. It is recognised by my Department that the use of this scheme is not an appropriate manner in which to fund such an important service and I wish to advise the Deputy that discussions are ongoing between officials from my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with regard to the mainstreaming of this service.</P>

      <P>In January 1991, as a precautionary measure in the event of a nuclear accident, consignments of potassium iodide tablets were distributed to each health board. The tablets were distributed to named officers of the health boards at central locations in each board area, including hospitals, to be held for supply to the public should the need arise. The distribution and use of iodine tablets was not a function of the former National Drugs Advisory Board, since replaced by the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> The necessity of continued stocking of iodine tablets as part of the health input into the national nuclear emergency plan was reviewed as part of an update of the overall plan which is</P>
    <P>co-ordinated by the Department of Public Enterprise. It was recommended that new stocks of iodine tablets should be purchased and pre-distributed as a more effective counter measure. I have accepted this recommendation and my Department is making the necessary arrangements as a matter of urgency for the purchase and distribution of these tablets.</P>
    <P>With regard to pre-distribution, a number of possible methods are currently under consideration. These include posting a supply to each household or distribution by health boards to households from a central location, or a combination of these. In addition, consideration is being given to holding some stocks centrally as a reserve in the event of tablets being lost or mislaid by individual households. Only the most severe nuclear accidents will require the use of iodine tablets. Ingestion of iodine tablets may be effective in preventing thyroid cancer in certain populations, especially children exposed to radioactive fallout.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to patients in the north-west and Donegal is the statutory responsibility of the North-Western Health Board &ndash; NWHB &ndash; in the first instance.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million &ndash; 6.729 million &ndash; has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million &ndash; 4.698 million &ndash; is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The NWHB has been allocated an additional £215,000 &ndash; 273,000 &ndash; this year for orthodontic services, of which £140,000 &ndash; 177,000 &ndash; was for the orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, <Col N="423" /> the board propose to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private practitioners to treat patients and validate its waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that two orthodontic specialists have recently been recruited to its orthodontic service: one will be based at Letterkenny General Hospital and the other at Sligo General Hospital. In addition, the board are actively pursuing the recruitment of a full-time consultant orthodontist and another orthodontic specialist. I am confident that these measures taken by the board will significantly increase the number of patients in orthodontic treatment.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the chief executive officer of the NWHB that at the end of the June 2001 quarter, there were 1,978 patients in orthodontic treatment in the board.</P>

      <P>More than half the patients who are in psychiatric hospitals longer than five years are over 65 years of age. As part of the Government's commitment to improving health services for older persons, the number of psychiatric teams specifically concerned with later life psychiatry has been increased in recent years. In 2001, £1.87 million &ndash; 2.37 million &ndash; is being provided towards the provision of additional consultants in old age psychiatry. Integration of community and hospital-based psychiatric services with geriatric medicine to provide comprehensive and appropriate packages for older people is progressing. Other steps being taken to improve services for this group of patients include rehabilitation, retraining and the reinstatement of life skills, de-designation of wards and transfer to more appropriate care settings.</P>
      <P>With regard to the remaining group of long-stay patients, those under 65, each health board plans to transfer such patients to community-based or other alternative facilities appropriate to their needs as part of the modernisation of the mental health services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 346 and 347 together.</P>
      <P>There is currently a world wide shortage of tetanus vaccine due to one of the major suppliers discontinuing production earlier this year. The Eastern Regional Health Authority which acts as the central purchasing agency for vaccines on behalf of all health boards, is working in conjunction with the existing supplier to ensure that there is sufficient product to meet essential needs. The ERHA is endeavouring to secure further supplies of tetanus vaccine as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>My Department has consulted the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland with regard to further advice on tetanus prophylaxis. The committee has recommended that a careful history of tetanus toxoid administration be taken to ensure that no unnecessary tetanus toxoid is given. This advice has been issued to each director of public health, asking him or her to bring it to the attention of all appropriate health care personnel in his or her area as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I confirm that the Irish College of General Practitioners has been in contact with my Department in relation to tetanus vaccine and that officials from my Department met recently with the ICGP to update them on the current situation.</P>

      <P>Since 31 March, 2001, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, has not accepted donations from persons who resided in the UK for a cumulative period of five years during the period 1980 to 1996. This has resulted in a loss of 5% of donors which is significant given the continual pressure on the IBTS to meet demands for blood supplies.</P>
      <P>The IBTS had planned from September to defer donors who resided in the UK for one year during the period 1980 and 1996, however, this was contingent on its ability to maintain an adequate blood supply. While the IBTS has recruited more than 10,000 new donors since March, it is not sufficient to offset the anticipated 7% shortfall of donors which would occur if additional donors who resided in the UK were deferred. Decisions by the IBTS to defer donors due to a possible risk of CJD must be balanced against the need to ensure an adequate blood supply. This is the advice of the CJD Advisory Group and of the Council of Europe's Committee of Experts on Blood Transfusion and Immunohaematology. The IBTS will review the situation early next year.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the blood supply at present is better than it has been for several months due in no small measure to the generous response of donors to the Blood for Life Week which I launched on 24 September, 2001. The IBTS will continue its efforts to further improve the blood supply and increase donor support.</P>

It is a matter for the board to decide its priority development projects within the national development plan. The board has included the provision of a dementia unit at St. Ita's Hospital in its proposals for inclusion in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware a project team has been approved and established. Furthermore, a design team has also been appointed for this development. The board has recently advised that it is intended that this development would be completed in the latter half of the National Development Plan 2001-2006.</P>

      <P>Limerick, this responsibility rests with the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>As with each of the other boards, the Mid-Western Health Board has been notified of the annual indicative funding available under the national development plan, NDP, for the period 2001 to 2006 to facilitate the development of capital projects, including health centres. The identification and prioritisation of projects which may proceed within the indicative funding is a matter for the board.</P>
      <P>The board has advised that the health centre located at Dooradoyle, Limerick, provides services for the population of Patrickswell and that there are no plans to change this arrangement. It is, however, planned to develop a major new health centre to replace the existing centre at Dooradoyle. Based on its plans for capital project developments within the indicative funding available to it under the NDP, the board has advised that it will not be possible to proceed with the development of the new health centre at Dooradoyle before 2005.</P>

      <P>The provision of medical rehabilitation services is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. A copy of the Deputy's correspondence has been referred to the chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Effective rehabilitation draws on a broad range of services to meet the particular needs of patients, with the objective of helping patients return to normal life in the community. In the light of this, a large element of rehabilitation services is provided on a day or community care basis. The relevant services range from specialist in-patient medical rehabilitation through such services as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. These services are often initiated in the context of in-patient treatment for another underlying illness or condition and subsequently continued on a day care basis or in the community, consistent with patients needs. It is, therefore, more appropriate to focus on ensuring that rehabilitation is provided to patients in the most appropriate setting rather than on the basis of identifying dedicated services for particular categories of patients other than those requiring specialist in-patient medical rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The provision of appropriate rehabilitation care is also an integral element of the service required by many types of patients and proposals for development of additional capacity in the services that contribute to rehabilitation are often presented in the context of proposals for broader service developments. For example, the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative identified that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care. This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of step-down or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="435" /> Rehabilitation services also have an important role for groups such as people with physical disabilities. Rehabilitation services in this area are provided as part of a comprehensive range of community based services. Since this Government came into office just over £107 million additional funding has been invested in the maintenance and development of services, including young chronic sick in need of constant nursing care and respite and therapy services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>I regard the continued development of rehabilitation services as an essential element of providing appropriate care to patients across a wide range of health services. I remain committed to the further development of rehabilitation services and my Department is currently considering the development of a national strategy for the development of rehabilitation services.</P>

      <P>In 1999, there were 374 admissions to psychiatric units for alcohol and drug abuse in people under 20 years of age.</P>
      <P>The report on the development of the psychiatric services, Planning for the Future, recommended that the emphasis on the management of alcohol and drug abuse should be on community-based intervention. Health boards have developed local alcohol-drugs services and recruited addiction counsellors to work in the community. The development of alternative treatment facilities in the community should reduce the necessity for admission to psychiatric units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Drugs Strategy which was published in May by the Taoiseach pays particular attention to the treatment of young drug users. It recommends that a protocol be developed for the treatment of persons under 18 years of age presenting with serious drug problems especially in light of the legal and other dilemmas which are <Col N="436" /> posed for professionals involved in the area and that a working group should be established for this purpose. I understand the Eastern Regional Health Authority is in the process of approving membership and terms of reference of this group and it is expected that the group will report by mid-2002.</P>

      <P>The Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act, 1975, provides that any person <Col N="437" /> who obstructs a traffic warden acting in the course of his or her duty shall be guilty of an offence. It is also an offence for a person to refuse or fail to give his or her name or address to a traffic warden, or to give a name or address which is false or misleading. A person found guilty of such offence shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £150.</P>
      <P>I also refer the Deputy to the reply of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to Parliamentary Question No. 31 of 7 March 2000. This makes it clear that a person who assaults a traffic warden in the course of his or her duty or otherwise can be prosecuted under the provisions of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, where there is evidence available to sustain a conviction against the alleged offender. Section 2 of the Act of 1997 creates the offence of assault, section 3, assault causing harm and section 4 creates the offence of assault causing serious harm. I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been assured by the Garda authorities that these existing provisions are sufficient.</P>

      <P>Section 246 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides for the making of regulations relating to fees payable to planning authorities. Such regulations may provide for the payment to planning authorities of fees in relation to the making of submissions or observations in respect of applications for permission. Under the draft regulations which have been sent on an informal basis to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government, a nominal fee is proposed to be charged to persons, other than the applicant or prescribed bodies, who make a written submission or observation on a planning application.</P>
      <P>The making of a general inquiry by a public representative as to the position regarding a planning application would not be regarded as the making of a submission or observation under the terms of the Act. However, where a formal written submission or observation by a public representative raises a substantive issue, it is intended that the general fee for the making of a submission or observation will apply.</P>

This includes land owned or occupied by a local authority.

      <P>The national hazardous waste management plan in respect of the period 2001 to 2006 has been made by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and copies of the plan are available in the Oireachtas Library. Under the Waste Management Act, <Col N="443" /> 1996, relevant public authorities are required to have regard to the plan and, where they consider it appropriate to do so, to take measures to implement or otherwise give effect to, recommendations contained in the plan.</P>
      <P>My Department will shortly, as recommended in the plan, establish an implementation committee which will be responsible for co-ordinating the overall implementation of the plan. Certain of the plan's key recommendations will also be addressed in the forthcoming policy statement on waste prevention and recovery.</P>
      <P>Improved collection and reception services for hazardous waste from household and commercial sources are already being put in place by local authorities. With regard to infrastructure, the plan identifies a requirement for landfill and thermal treatment capacity for hazardous waste requiring disposal, so as to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce our reliance on export outlets. A private company has announced proposals to develop a hazardous waste incineration facility at Ringaskiddy, County Cork. As an exceptional measure, having regard to the polluter pays principle, grant assistance will be available under the NDP to support the provision of landfill capacity for hazardous wastes.</P>

      <P>The proposed water and sewerage schemes for Foynes both include measures which will help to eliminate the causes of occasional flooding in Foynes. In addition, I understand that the local authority is separately considering other flood prevention measures which could be put in place in the short-term.</P>
      <P>The Foynes water scheme is included as a scheme to commence construction in my Department's water services investment programme, 2000-02, at an estimated cost of £1.6 million, 2.031 million. I approved the Limerick County Council's tender recommendation for the civil works contract last August. The council's tender recommendation for the mechanical and electrical works contract was submitted to my Department recently and is being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contract documents for the sewerage scheme submitted to my Department by the council in 1992, and revised in 1996, have not been approved. The Foynes-Shanagolden sewerage scheme is 15th on the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Limerick County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the <Col N="446" /> assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme, 2000-02 announced in July 2000. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it has not been possible to include it in the programme.</P>

      <P>Under the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations, 1993, rented accommodation, including dwellings let by local authorities, must comply with certain minimum standards. The regulations require, <i>inter alia</i>, that such dwellings must be provided with a sink with hot water facilities and a supply of cold water from the service pipe from the public main or other source.</P>
      <P>Cork Corporation has indicated to my Department that it is prepared to provide hot water facilities in any of its rented houses which lack this facility, where this is brought to its attention. I, therefore, suggest that the Deputy might forward to the corporation details of any dwellings involved.</P>

      <P>The provision of adequate bathroom facilities in their rented dwellings is a matter for individual local authorities as part of their responsibility for the management, maintenance and improvement of their housing stock.</P>
      <P>A specific programme of funding by my Department for the provision of bathrooms in rented local authority dwellings operated until 1999. At that stage, of an estimated 700 local authority dwellings which lacked these facilities, over 600 were having bathrooms provided under the remedial works programme and in the case of about 100 dwellings, the tenants &ndash; who were generally elderly &ndash; had refused to have bathroom facilities provided.</P>
      <P>The scale of this problem is now residual, but I intend that efforts should be continued to ensure that all rented local authority houses have bathroom facilities.</P>

      <P>Following the making of regulations in November 2000 providing for the liberalisation of availability of taxi licences, I arranged for the introduction of a scheme of refunds by certain local authorities in relation to licence fees charged at above the default level fixed in the Public Service Vehicle Regulations, 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional mitigating measures were included <Col N="448" /> in the Finance Act, 2001, which provides for a new scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the cost of taxi licences acquired on or before 21 November 2000. The allowances are effectively backdated with the cost being deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 where the licence was purchased prior to that date.</P>
    <P>The actual cost of the licence can be written off over five years at the rate of 20% per annum in line with the new write-off period for capital allowances for plant and machinery. The write-off will be allowed against the trading income only of the licence owner who drives the taxi. However, if additionally the same vehicle is rented out on a part-time basis, then the cost can be written off against both the trading income and the rental income from the vehicle in question.</P>
    <P>The Act also includes provisions targeted at addressing some hardship cases that had been brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance. Specifically, it provides that where a licence is inherited from a deceased spouse who carried on a taxi trade, the licence holder may offset the capital expenditure incurred on the original acquisition of the licence against the rental income alone from the licence, even if there is no trading income from the licence. Where inheritance tax or probate tax was paid in respect of a taxi licence, the value used for such tax purposes may be used instead of the actual capital expenditure cost, if that value is higher. The capital allowance scheme also caters specifically for the situation where a widow or widower, who has inherited the licence from his or her spouse, lets the licence to a third party who provides the associated vehicle.</P>

It is estimated that the better safety record of these roads will result in an annual saving of over 50 lives annually from 2007 onwards.</P>
      <P>Good progress is being maintained with the development of the national road network as mandated in the NDP, including on the five key inter-urban routes. A number of important projects have been completed this year, including Dunleer-Dundalk, M1; southern cross route, M50; Croom bypass, N20; Kilmacthomas bypass, N25; and Blackpool bypass, N20. Further projects are expected to open to traffic in 2001, including Pilltown-Fiddown, N24; Claremorris phase 1, N17; Camaross, N25; and Ballycarthy, N21.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear &ndash; BSCF &ndash; allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards in parallel with the supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year. An allowance of £63, 79.99, is payable in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £78, 99.04, is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years.</P>
      <P>A person may qualify for payment of the BSCF allowance if he or she is in receipt of a social welfare, health board payment, participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and has household income at or below certain prescribed levels. Details of the income levels, which vary depending on the composition of the household, are shown in the following tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The South-Eastern Health Board was contacted on behalf on the person in question and has advised that her application was refused on the grounds of excess means.

While she is in receipt of family income supplement, FIS, this is disregarded in deciding her entitlement to BSCF allowance. Her weekly income from employment is £211, 267.91, which puts her £70, 88.88, per week in excess of the appropriate BSCF income limit.

      <P>Details of expenditure on rent supplements paid by the health boards under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in the years from 1996 to date are as set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on rent supplements has increased substantially in recent years. This was mainly due to increases in rent levels in the private rented sector rather than recipient numbers. For example, there are currently 43,247 households in receipt of rent supplement, compared to 42,682 at the end of 2000 and 41,873 at the end of 1999. However, expenditure in 2001 is expected to be some £134 million, 170.14 million, compared to £101 million, 128.24 million in 1999, an increase of 33% over a two year period.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. Under the terms of the SWA scheme payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is subject to a means test. Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less £6, 7.62. This £6, 7.62, represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Most recipients pay more than £6, 7.62, towards their rent because applicants are required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is not normally payable to people in full time employment. However, special arrangements have been in place for a number of years now which allow <Col N="454" /> people on approved schemes such as community employment, CE, to retain part of their rent or mortgage interest supplement, subject to a gross household income limit of £250, 317.43, per week and certain other conditions. Following discussions with the social partners under Partnership 2000 substantial improvements in the conditions relating to the retention of rent and mortgage interest supplements were introduced from 6 April 2000.</P>
    <P>The £250 per month limit on the amount of rent supplement payable was abolished and the sharp withdrawal of support at the end of the third year was removed, the supplement now being withdrawn on a tapered basis over a four year period, that is, 75% in year one, 50% in year two, 25% in year three and 25% in year four. As a result, many participants in CE schemes now retain a greater amount of rent supplement than they would have done under the earlier arrangements. This is particularly the case for families.</P>
    <P>In no circumstances do the new rules result in a lower rate of rent supplement than is payable under the standard rules of supplementary welfare allowance. All CE recipients are entitled to either the gradually reducing amount that can be retained under the transitional arrangements described above or the amount that is normally paid under the standard rules of supplementary welfare allowance described earlier, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>The South-Eastern Health Board was contacted on behalf of the person in question and has advised that he applied for rent supplement on 27 September 2001. Its decision was to award rent supplement of £15.62, 19.83, per week. The board is now re-examining that decision, taking into account all of the available information regarding the person's earnings, hours of employment and so on. If a different amount is found to be payable, then the necessary adjustment will be made immediately.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 404, 409, 410 and 411 together.</P>
      <P>The free schemes, including the free electricity-gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence schemes, are generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who fulfil a means test. They are also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
      <P>The free schemes share a common set of objectives in the area of social inclusion. These are defined as: to provide assistance to those living alone by targeting them with specific benefits providing both income and social inclusion gains; to support older people and people with disabilities in their wish to remain in the community as opposed to institutional care; and to support Government policy which seeks to acknowledge the value of older people in society.</P>
      <P>The many demands to extend the free schemes to other groups, including widows and widowers have been examined using social inclusion objectives as the criteria for decision. The schemes as currently constituted provide a basic package that ensures a limited standard of comfort or well-being to a particular targeted group, that is based on age or receipt of a disability related payment. Persons who are under the qualifying age or who are not in receipt of a disability related payment may not qualify for the free schemes. However, depending on the person's particular circumstances, it might be more advantageous for that person to transfer to disability allowance. If the Deputy has a particular person in mind, I would be glad to examine the entitlement to one of my Department's disability related payments.</P>
      <P>Widows-widowers who are living alone may experience social exclusion, but they are not necessarily groups in need of community care support nor do they experience the same physical risks of isolation as older people and people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where payment levels are adequate, any extension of the free schemes should be based solely <Col N="456" /> on increased social benefits that are over and above those which can be purchased by increased income.</P>
    <P>The cost of extending the free schemes to all widows, regardless of age, income and household composition, would be in the region of £28 million. It estimated that the cost of extending the free schemes to widows over the age of 60 would be in the region of £20 million. However, neither of these groups could be considered to have the type of needs that require the same type of targeting as older people or people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also available to carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this scheme is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active within the community, thereby reducing the need for institutional care. Thus, the scheme is available to people in receipt of disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension. Extending the scheme to people under age 66 who are not in receipt of a disability related payment is outside the scope and objective of the scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed price increases in electricity and gas, the objective of the free electricity-gas allowance is to provide for a basic standard of electricity or gas usage. The main advantage of free electricity-gas allowance is that it is based on a unit allowance and, therefore, automatically keeps pace with electricity or gas price increases. For example, the free electricity allowance covers 1,500 units each year, 200 units per billing period in the summer and 300 units per billing period in the winter, in addition to the normal standing charges. VAT due on this standard allowance is also covered. The value of the allowance, if fully taken up, is £156.57, 198.80, per annum. Proposals being considered in relation to a household benefit involve standardising the qualifying conditions and basis of assessment for the free schemes, particularly those relating to the free telephone and the free electricity scheme, so that people who qualify will receive the full package of schemes. It is not intended to replace the schemes with a single cash payment as suggested.</P>
    <P>The current arrangements for the free schemes will be kept under review in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 406 and 408 together.</P>
      <P>The Christmas bonus has been paid at a rate equivalent to 70% of a person's normal weekly payment, subject to a minimum payment of £20 &ndash; 25.39 &ndash; since 1989. In 2000, it was increased to 100% or double the person's normal weekly payment, again subject to a minimum payment of £20 &ndash; 25.39 &ndash; and will be paid on a similar basis in 2001. The cost of this measure is estimated to be £79.1 million &ndash; 100.4 million. Payment will be made in early December and it is estimated that it will benefit some 1.2 million persons comprising some 780,000 recipients and an estimated 400,000 dependants.</P>
      <P>The bonus will be paid to recipients of long-term payments including disablement pension, death benefit by way of pension, old age contributory and non-contributory pensions, retirement pension, invalidity pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, widow's and widower's contributory pension, orphan's contributory and non-contributory pensions, pre-retirement allowance, blind pension, carer's allowance, one parent family payment, payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, farm assist and disability allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The focus of the Christmas bonus is firmly on long-term welfare payment recipients and any proposal to extend the bonus to persons in receipt of disability benefit or unemployment benefit would be inconsistent with this basic objective, and would create inevitable pressures for its <Col N="458" /> further extension to other short-term categories in the future.</P>
    <P>It is already open to persons who have been in receipt of disability benefit for at least a year to be assessed for invalidity pension, and, if found eligible for same, to qualify for the Christmas bonus payment. I have no plans at present to extend the bonus payment to the short-term schemes this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear &ndash; BSCF &ndash; allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards in parallel with the supplementary welfare allowance &ndash; SWA &ndash; scheme. The scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year.</P>
      <P>An allowance of £63 &ndash; 79.99 &ndash; is payable in respect of qualified children from two to 11 years and an allowance of £78 &ndash; 99.04 &ndash; is payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years. A person may qualify for payment of the BSCF allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment or participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain prescribed levels.</P>
      <P>Orphan's pension is not considered to be a qualifying payment under the terms of the BSCF scheme. The orphan's pension, which is a basic social welfare payment, is payable to the guardian and is intended to cover the child's cost of living, including food and clothing. Eligible applicants will receive either a contributory or non-contributory orphan's pension of up to £63.60 &ndash; 80.76 &ndash; per week. In comparison, the allowance paid in respect of dependant children with other social welfare or health board payments is either £13.20 &ndash; 16.76 &ndash; or £15.20 &ndash; 19.30 &ndash; per week. The higher rate of orphan's pension as compared with the child dependant allowance rate means that the guardian may receive an additional income of up to £2,500 &ndash; 3,174.35 &ndash; per annum in respect of the orphaned child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware I established a working group to undertake a review of the BSCF scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review has examined all aspects of the scheme including the rates of payment as well the income limits, the means test, time of payment, the eligibility criteria and other issues. I am expecting delivery of the group's final report in the near future. Any <Col N="459" /> recommendations for changes in the operation of the scheme will have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 414 to 417, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitments in An Action Programme for the Millennium form the basis for the establishment of the Family Support Agency. My proposals for a Family Support Agency were further informed by the report of the Commission on the Family which identified the crucial role of accessible counselling services, a nationwide family mediation service and major investment in local community support in strengthening families.</P>
      <P>Family fora, which have taken place around the country, have affirmed the need for a close synergy between State, community and family in aiming to address the complex social problems arising in today's society.</P>
      <P>The new agency will bring together the main programmes and pro-family services introduced by the Government in line with Families First in recent years &ndash; to support families, promote continuity and stability in family life and prevent marital breakdown and foster a supportive community environment for families at local level. Some £12 million &ndash; 15.24 million &ndash; has been allocated this year by the Government for the development of family services &ndash; up from £1.5 million &ndash; 1.9 million &ndash; in 1997.</P>
      <P>The Family Support Agency will provide a family mediation service: support, promote and develop the provision of marriage and relationship counselling and other family support services; support, promote and develop the family and community services resource centre (FRC) programme; provide information on these services and parenting issues; undertake research and advise me, as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, about family matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus the Family Support Agency will provide a comprehensive and coherent response for families in need of these services and for families generally. All of these separate activities are cur<Col N="461" /> rently taking place in my Department but it is my own view and that of the Government that a State agency affords the opportunity to bring a coherence into this complex area.</P>
    <P>The FRCs are an essential component of the Families First approach in building neighbourhood solidarity and responding to families locally. That is why they have been singled out by Government in recent years for radical improvement and expansion, a course recommended by the Commission on the Family.</P>
    <P>In 1997, there were ten centres. In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to the establishment of 100 centres. To date there are 75 centres either operational or approved for inclusion in the programme.</P>
    <P>The Family Support Agency legislation provides an enabling framework within which the Government have decided that the FRC programme can be further developed. The Family Support Agency will be an important resource to the work of the centres enhancing the role and capacity of these local community initiatives in responding to families at neighbourhood level.</P>
    <P>Reassurances about all of these matters and clarification of the Government proposals as set out in the Family Support Agency Bill, the promotion and development of the centres' ways of working and identification of the administrative and practical issues to be addressed to ensure a smooth transfer of the programmes to the new agency when it is established are the focus of ongoing discussions between officials of my Department and the FRC forum. Officials from my Department met representatives of the FRCs on 6 July 2001. A meeting with representatives of the FRC forum took place on 26 September and a further meeting at official level is planned for 13 November. I plan to officially launch the forum later this month.</P>
    <P>All of these events are taking place in the spirit of participation and co-working in pursuit of a common aim &ndash; in this case the well-being of families &ndash; as envisaged in the Government White Paper on supporting voluntary activity which also affirms the fundamental responsibility of Government for setting the direction of policy in social and economic issues.</P>
    <P>The Government plans for the Family Support Agency were first announced on 15 May 2001 &ndash; UN International Day of Families. Representatives from more than 300 voluntary and community groups providing family support services, the social partners and public representatives were invited to the launch.</P>
    <P>The Family Support Agency Bill was published on 13 July 2001 and is at present before Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>A fully integrated plan for the major renovation of Chesterfield Avenue in the Phoenix Park has been prepared by my Department and will be submitted for planning permission shortly by the Office of Public Works which is undertaking project management of the scheme. The safety of all park users has been paramount in the preparation of this plan which has been developed in consultation with the Dublin Transportation Office and will involve a variety of traffic calming measures compatible with the historic ethos of the park. The project has been prepared within the context of a revised management plan for the future management of the park currently being drafted.</P>
      <P>Subject to availability of funding, this programme of works will be carried out on a phased basis in order to minimise disruption to park users. The scheme will significantly improve the safety of all park users, but in particular, pedestrians, cyclists and other recreational users. The outcome of the work to be undertaken will, by any standards, represent a significant enhancement to this national historic park.</P>

      <P>During the soil stripping phases of road construction in the townland of Kilsharvan a number of possible archaeological features were uncovered. These features lay in the course of the road at various locations over a distance of 1.6 km. The consultant archaeologist requested 19 licences to mitigate the archaeology along this stretch of roadway. The number of licences involved reflects both the variety and extensiveness of archaeological features uncovered in this area.</P>
      <P>The features included burnt soil, charcoal deposits, pits, cobbling, flint and pottery fragments, all of which were excavated before the road construction works and a full record of the features is being prepared. Preservation by record in this manner is consistent with my Department's policy in dealing with sites where impacts from development are unavoidable.</P>
      <P>All applicants for archaeological licences are required to submit an application form giving details of the proposed excavation and which includes a statement on the proposed methodology for undertaking the work. This enables my officials to assess the proposed excavation to ensure that the purpose of the excavation is validated and that correct procedures and standards will be applied to the excavation. The criteria for such excavation is published in guidelines issued by my Department, a copy of which I will forward to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Tógfaigh mé Ceisteanna 428 agus 430 le chéile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ag tógáil san áireamh an chosúlacht idir an dá cheist atá curtha, ceisteanna 428 agus 430, táthar chun an dá cheist a fhreagairt le chéile mar seo a leanas. Níl aon amhras ach go bhfuil tionchar ag an lagú eacnamaíochta idirnáisiúnta ar fhostaíocht i go leor comhlachtaí ar fud na tíre agus níor éalaigh comhlachtaí i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall ón lagú eacnamaíochta sin. Tá poiblíocht faighte ag formhór na gcásanna inar cailleadh fostaíocht i gcomhlachtaí agus cásanna eile, ar an drochuair, inar dúnadh comhlachtaí in iomlán. Ba cheart a thuairisciú freisin go bhfuil comhlachtaí áirithe sa chontae ina bhfuil an fhostaíocht méadaithe agus tá dóchas ag an údarás go maolóidh na postanna nua sin an mórthionchar a bhéas ag aon chailliúintí i gceantar Gaeltachta Dhún na nGall don bhliain. Tá an t-údarás, faoi láthair i mbun a <Col N="468" /> shuirbhé iomlán bliantúil ar fhostaíocht iomlán i chuile ghnólucht Gaeltachta agus ní bheidh torthaí an tsuirbhé sin ar fáil go dtí aimsir na Nollag. Ag éirí as na rudaí a tharla le gairid i Meiriceá agus i dtíortha eile, beidh sé ar a laghad an mhí sin sula mbeadh torthaí cruinn ar an suirbhé. Déanann an t-údarás fógra poiblí ag tús gach bliain ar mhéaduithe agus laghduithe sa bhfostaíocht i ngach ceantar Gaeltachta agus beidh an rud céanna á dhéanamh ag tús na bliana seo chugainn. Go dtí sin ní bheadh aon eolas a chuirfeadh an t-údarás ar fáil iomlán agus ní bheadh pictiúr cruinn ar fáil den mhéid atá tar éis tarlú le bliain anuas. Cuirfear an t-eolas atá lorgaithe ag an Teachta chuige a luaithe is a chuirtear le chéile é.</P>

      <P>Over the summer months my Department completed essential remedial works at An Grianán of Aileach to repair damage to the monument which resulted from vandalism earlier in the year. To facilitate this work and prevent further damage to the monument my Department secured from Donegal County Council a temporary closure of the access road leading to the car park at the monument. This meant that access to the car park was limited to the periods 8.30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Friday and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays, and bank holidays. Visitors who wished to access the monument outside of these periods could do so by walking from the access road.</P>
      <P>With the putting in place of these arrangements my Department has reported a considerable improvement in the condition of both the monument itself and indeed the remainder of the site with no reports of any damage being caused by vandalism. It was for this reason that my Department sought and has received the approval of Donegal County Council to have the temporary road closure extended until March 2002. I can confirm that during this period access to the site for visitors will be during the hours 8.30 a.m. to sundown Monday to Friday and 10 a.m. to sundown on Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays. In seeking to restrict access to this site to daylight hours my Department's only concern is the long-term security and stability of an unique monument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is at present considering the possibility of providing a smaller car park adjacent to the location of the barrier which gives effect to the road closure. Plans in this regard are being prepared with a view to discussions taking <Col N="470" /> place with Donegal County Council in the coming months.</P>
    <P>On a related matter, the archaeological testing of the pathway from the fort to St. Patrick's Well was completed within the last two weeks. My Department is making the necessary arrangements to undertake repair work to both the well and pathway to ensure that access to this part of the site is safe and presented in the appropriate manner.</P>

      <P>My decisions on the ACCESS scheme were based on the recommendations made by the advisory committee which evaluated all eligible applications. Unfortunately, on foot of this evaluation the project referred to by the Deputy was not recommended and was not included in the list of projects put before me for consideration. The funding available under ACCESS is £36 million. The scheme attracted great interest and was oversubscribed with 180 project promoters seeking grant aid in the order of £224 million. In these circumstances difficult decisions had to be taken and many worthwhile projects had to be omitted from the final list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no specific statutory provisions regarding the rights of residence of the non-national parents of an Irish-born citizen child where residency rights are claimed on that basis. Furthermore, there are no statutory provisions which confer an entitlement to Irish citizenship on the non-national parents of such a child. The substantive case law in this area was set out in the decision of the Supreme Court in the Fajujonu case [1990] 2 I.R. 151. The Supreme Court found that an Irish citizen child had the right to the company of its non-national parents and that such parents had a strong claim to be allowed to reside in the State for that purpose. Section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001, provides that every person born in the island of Ireland is entitled to be an Irish citizen. This feature of Irish citizenship law is unique in the European Union, and unusual worldwide. In other EU member states the citizenship of a child born in that state is generally dependent on the citizenship of the parents and, or, the status and duration of residence of the parents in the state concerned. Applications for permission to remain on the basis of parentage of an Irish born citizen child are potentially open to abuse. For example, there have been a number of instances where applicants submitted false claims of parentage of an Irish citizen. Accordingly, my Department is keeping this issue under review.</P>

      <P>Records in my Department are not maintained in such a way that would readily disclose whether or not any of the statutory conditions for naturalisation were dispensed with in respect of the persons whose names appeared in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. It is not possible to provide this information without an examination of each file which would involve a disproportionate expenditure of staff resources. However, separate records <Col N="472" /> are maintained in relation to persons naturalised under the investment based naturalisation scheme. Applications by three of the 859 persons whose names were included in <i>Iris Oifigiúil </i>on 5 October 2001 were processed under that scheme.</P>
      <P>Two of these persons were the spouse and minor child of an investor who had been naturalised under the scheme in 1996. The other case related to an application by an investor which had been made prior to the suspension of the scheme by the previous Government on 4 September 1996.</P>

      <P>The person to whom he refers is on temporary release from Mountjoy Prison and is in receipt of a daily gratuity of £1, or 1.27, from that institution. The temporary release is granted for a period of two months which is renewed subject to continued good behaviour. The probation and welfare service supervises this person in the community and the supervising officer receives the gratuity payment once every two months from the prison and passes it on to the person concerned when the temporary release renewal form is being signed. I am informed by the prison authorities that there are no outstanding moneys due to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>In relation to a Garda CCTV system for Tallaght, I am informed by the Garda that the planning, including the consultation process, for the location and operation of system in Tallaght has commenced with the objective of having it installed and operational in 2002. The chief superintendent for DMA, south, has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the CCTV system in Tallaght. He is assisted by an implementation committee comprising representatives of the Garda telecommunications section, who will project manage the technical aspects of the system, local crime prevention officers, the ESB, the local authority, the Office of Public Works and local business Interests. A first meeting of the implementation committee chaired by the chief superintendent took place in Crumlin Garda station on 12 June 2001. A full outline of the systems requirements were given by the Garda telecommunications section and the various interested parties were informed of the requirements that will need to be provided by them for the project's completion.</P>
      <P>A request for tender document is currently being prepared and it is planned to seek tenders for the system before the end of the year.</P>

    <P>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue): I am informed that there is no record in my Department of an application for a certificate of naturalisation having been received from the person referred to by the Deputy. Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, requires, <i>inter alia</i>, that an applicant &ldquo;has had a period of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years&rdquo;. Based on the information held in my Department about the applicant, it would appear that he will not be eligible to apply for a certificate of naturalisation until May 2003 at the earliest.</P>

      <P>In accordance with long-standing policy I do not propose to comment in detail on an individual case. I am advised, however, that the reception and integration agency of my Department, following consideration of all aspects of the case, decided to relocate the asylum seeker in question from the Ormonde Hostel in Kilkenny. The primary consideration of the agency in this regard was the safety and well being of all residents and staff at the accommodation centre. Two offers of alternative accommodation have been made by the agency to the person in question, notwithstanding the fact that, by his behaviour, he could be deemed to have rendered himself homeless. Neither of these offers has, to date, been taken up.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board does not routinely record information relating to an average waiting time for people seeking a consultation with a solicitor. I should mention that, in relation to applicants waiting for legal services, the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases over other cases, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and cases where there are time limits. In these cases the application is dealt with immediately. The board does, however, record the length of time the person longest on the waiting list has waited and the following tabular statement shows the average longest waiting time in months at each of the board's law centres for those seeking the boards' services.</P>

      <P>The persons referred to by the Deputy applied for certificates of naturalisation in December 1996. In November 1998 I decided to refuse certificates of naturalisation in these instances and the applicants were informed of this decision in writing. The persons referred to may apply again at any time in the future provided that they meet the statutory requirements for naturalisation at the time of application.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of the difficulties faced by residents as a result of anti-social activities of this nature. As Minister, I am determined to ensure the Garda Síochána has all the legislative powers, manpower and financial resources it needs to effectively tackle public order issues. In fact, the letter referred to by the Deputy acknowledges that the increase in Garda resources is bearing fruit. While I can appreciate the distress caused to residents by the disgraceful <Col N="478" /> behaviour of the people who were drinking in public on the 29 September 2001, it is only fair to point out that the Garda Síochána did succeed in moving them on later in the evening. With regard to the powers available to the Garda, the legal position is that section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, makes it an offence for any person to be present in a public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that he or she might be a danger to himself or herself or to any other person in the vicinity.</P>
      <P>Section 5 of the 1994 Act creates the offence of disorderly conduct in a public place and section 6 creates the offence of using or engaging in any threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. Section 8 of the 1994 Act empowers the Garda to &ldquo;move on&rdquo; persons who are acting in a manner contrary to the provisions or who are loitering in a public place in circumstances which give rise to apprehension for the safety of persons or property or the maintenance of the public peace.</P>
      <P>The Garda has not indicated that the operation of the provisions in question has given rise to any particular difficulties. The provisions of the 1994 Act are used extensively by gardaí and I believe that it is widely accepted that the legislation has proved invaluable to the Garda in dealing with public order issues. While I have no plans for further legislative changes, I can say that the operation of the law in this area is being kept under review by my Department. I shall also, of course, take into account any recommendations that may be made on the subject matter by the commission on liquor licensing which I have established, with the approval of the Government, to review all aspects of the liquor licensing system.</P>

      <P>It is undoubtedly the case that the Immigration Registration Office, Harcourt Square, has experienced unprecedented growth in demand for its services in recent years and that this in turn has led to delays for persons seeking to register or renew their permission to remain in the Dublin area. The number of persons registered at the office has grown from 12,803, in 1998, to 17,064 in 1999, 26,641 in 2000 and more than 40,000 during the first nine months of 2001. This increase in activity reflects the growth in the level of legal migration to the State <Col N="479" /> and in particular the significant increase in the number of work permits issued to non-EEA nationals.</P>
      <P>The Garda National Immigration Bureau, which was established following a Government decision of 9 May 2000, has as one of its key responsibilities the co-ordination of registration services throughout the State. Since its establishment it has made considerable progress towards responding to the demands now being placed upon the Immigration Registration Office. The number of civilian staff has been more than doubled from ten to 24 and the opening hours have been extended so that the office is now open from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday to Thursday inclusive, and from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday. Furthermore, I understand from the Garda authorities that, in practice, the office regularly stays open until 9.30 p.m. in order to process applications for all persons who have attended the office on that day. Occasionally, if a person cannot be dealt with on the day of his or her attendance he or she will be given an appointment to call to the office on a subsequent Saturday or Sunday. In addition, the Garda National Immigration Bureau has recently introduced an IT system at the registration office to make the process of registration more efficient. The old paper based registration process has now been replaced by a fully computerised system whereby all data is recorded electronically and the customer is issued on the day of registration with a credit card size registration certificate incorporating a digitised photograph. This card replaces the old green book registration certificate which had to be prepared manually and posted to the person several weeks after their attendance at the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda National Immigration Bureau has my full support in its efforts and I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in respect of future needs arising in relation to all aspects of the bureau's work. Furthermore, my Department, in consultation with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, carried out a review of registration requirements earlier this year and on foot of that review has introduced a number of measures which are designed to streamline the operation of the registration system. Certain categories of non-EEA nationals will no longer be required to register as often as heretofore thereby reducing the numbers who are likely to attend on any given day. The scope for further streamlining of the operation is being kept under ongoing review. Despite these improvements and the considerable commitment on the part of staff working in the Immigration Registration Office, the present accommodation militates against the introduction of certain other initiatives which have been considered in the current situation. Accordingly, my Department and the Garda authorities have been in consultation with the Office of Public Works with a view to securing a new and far larger building for the Dublin area. I am pleased to be able to advise the Deputy that <Col N="480" /> the legal formalities for acquiring this building are currently being finalised by the Office of Public Works. This new office will make it possible to deal with a far higher number of persons at any given time, thereby reducing queuing times as well as improving the quality of service generally. A significant amount of work will be necessary in order to fit out the building but I expect the accommodation to be ready for occupation next year.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda that over the six Sundays referred to by the Deputy a total of 32 cars were towed to the Garda pound and of these there were five with Galway registrations. The reasons cars were towed by the Garda Síochána on the dates in question were for infringements of the parking by-laws. The most common offences were blocking residential driveways, parking on footpaths, parking on corners, parking in wheelchair space, parking between Garda no-parking cones and blocking fire exits.</P>
      <P>As outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 431 of 9 October 2001 the Office of the Director of Traffic, Dublin Corporation, also has powers under the traffic laws to tow away vehicles as well as to clamp vehicles for infringements of the traffic and parking legislation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, arising from the increased activity in the property market, the intake of applications in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds has grown to an unprecedented level with each successive year setting new record levels. From current figures available it appears that the intake of applications for 2001 will be approximately 160,000. Last year, to address the increasing intake of applications, I received sanction from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to increase the staffing compliment of the Land Registry by 77. Most of these appointments were made during the past year and the training of the new staff is now beginning to pay dividends. Already this year, to the end of September, more than 112,000 dealings representing an increase in output for the same period of almost 47% in 2000 have been completed. I have recently received sanction for a further 19 temporary posts, and a recruitment drive is now under way.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made by the management and staff of the Land Registry to address the problems which have developed over a period of time, mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the levels of business. The Land Registry management is implementing some proactive measures to help deal with the situation, including improvements to workflow, the training and development of staff, the use of new technology, the launch of an e-commerce service and the computerised data capture of folios and maps. I am confident that, with the appointment of additional staff and the programme of measures being taken, the situation will continue to improve.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of personnel and resources to individual areas, that Kennelsfort Road, which runs from Coldcut Road to Palmerstown Village, is the boundary between the L and Q districts. As one travels towards Palmerstown from Ballyfermot the right-hand side of the road is covered by Ballyfermot Garda station while the left hand side of the road is covered by Ronanstown Garda station. Kennelsfort Road is the natural and most suitable boundary between the two districts.</P>
      <P>I have been further informed that, in policing terms, being on the border of two districts, as Palmerstown is, greatly increases the level of policing in the area. Ballyfermot station has a community garda assigned to its part of Palmerstown and Ronanstown has two community gardaí assigned to its area. Uniformed and unmarked mobiles from both stations patrol the area regularly. If a matter requiring Garda attention occurs the members deal with it regardless of what side of the road it occurs on.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Friday, Saturday nights, both stations deploy a public order van which contains two members each to deal with breaches of public order as they arise. Should a serious breach occur in the Palmerstown area, both vans can respond to the situation as well as patrol cars from Ballyfermot and Ronanstown Stations. The Garda further informs me that these arrangements are working well in the context of providing an efficient policing service.</P>

      <P>The deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. I am informed by the Garda that the Commissioner has established a working group <Col N="485" /> comprising senior Garda management personnel to examine all of the relevant action points in the national drugs strategy 2001 to 2008. This examination includes the action point relating to making additional resources available to existing drugs units, and the establishment of similar units in areas where they do not currently exist.</P>
      <P>As regards the Louth-Meath division, I am also informed by the Garda that there are 12 gardaí currently engaged in drug and general crime duties within the division, of whom five are based in Navan. All Garda operational personnel have a responsibility for and are tasked with the enforcement of drugs legislation. Furthermore, the Garda national drugs unit supplements local gardaí in particular cases.</P>

This compares to a figure of 541 in December 1997. The above figures represent an increase of 63, or 11.65%, in the personnel allocated to Cork city during that period. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management is satisfied that the personnel strength currently allocated to Cork city is adequate to meet the present policing requirements of the area. However, the levels will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Cork city will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country.</P>

    <P>In addition, 15 persons consisting of four family groups and three individuals have been admitted to the State under a UNHCR resettlement quota programme in the last six months. Such refugees are initially offered short-term temporary accommodation in the Dublin area and are then supported by the Reception and Integration Agency in sourcing accommodation in the private rented sector. On their arrival at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner at Mount Street, Dublin 2, all applicants for asylum are offered accommodation under the system of direct provision. New applicants are provided with accommodation initially at one of the eight reception centres currently used by the Reception and Integration Agency in the Dublin area. When their initial needs have been determined in the reception centre &ndash; generally within two weeks of making their application &ndash; they are assigned to a regional accommodation centre in accordance with the Government's policy of dispersal and direct provision.</P>
    <P>The Reception and Integration Agency currently uses 77 accommodation centres in 24 counties for this purpose. When making placements to these centres, the agency has regard to a number of factors which include the general availability of accommodation, marital status, family size, age of children, medical and other special needs and cultural background. Moreover, the agency when procuring accommodation facilities generally, has regard to the requirement to achieve to the great<Col N="488" /> est extent possible a balanced distribution of asylum seekers throughout the State commensurate with, <i>inter alia,</i> availability and capacity of services such as health, welfare and education as well as local population and infrastructure.</P>
    <P>A core function of the Reception and Integration Agency is the ongoing assessment of accommodation requirements for asylum seekers and programme refugees. This includes planning for future needs and, in that regard, the agency has currently embarked upon a programme of developing purpose-built facilities which incorporate, in addition to accommodation, medical, welfare and recreational facilities. The first such facility at Knockalisheen on the outskirts of Limerick city is currently being brought into service on a phased basis. The Deputy will be aware that asylum seekers granted status and those given leave to remain in the State are entitled to access housing of every tenure.</P>

      <P>Since I launched the RAPID programme in Cork in March last, significant progress has been made. A working group was immediately established by the Cork City Development Board to begin the process of implementing the pogramme and the city monitoring group was established in June. Consultations with local communities was initiated by the community forum representatives of the city monitoring group in April and this work is being built upon by the local co-ordinators who took up their positions in August. The area implementation teams are commencing work this week on the drawing up of local area plans, the target date for completion of which is 31 December next. The front-loading of investment under the national development plan will follow in 2002 and 2003.</P>

      <P>I wish to answer Questions Nos. 476 to 478, inclusive, and 480 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,467 applications were received under the sports capital programme in 2001. A total of £3,756,000, 4,769,136, was allocated in grants to 70 of the 164 projects from County Cork which applied for support under the programme. This is the second highest amount &ndash; behind only Dublin &ndash; of any county in the State. Of the 164 applications received from County Cork, 24 were located in Cork city, nine of which received grants totalling £1,114,000, 1,414,448. A schedule containing the full range of information requested by the Deputy on the applicants to the 2001 programme follows. Blank entries in relation to applicants under the &ldquo;Amount Requested&rdquo; column indicate that that information was not supplied by the applicant, while blank entries under the &ldquo;Grant&rdquo; column indicate a grant was not allocated to the applicant.</P>

      <P>While I am aware of proposals to establish a sports and exercise medicine faculty by the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians in Ireland, I have not received a formal application for funding for the project. The question of any funding for the faculty would have to be considered in the context of the Irish Sports Council's strategies and priorities for the development of competitive and high performance sport, as well as the project's eligibility under the terms and conditions governing the funding schemes operated by the Irish Sports Council and by my Department.</P>

      <P>In general there are four stages in a swimming pool project under the local authority swimming pool programme, 2000-02, which is administered by my Department. In order of progression, these stages are those of the preliminary report, the contract document, the tender and construction. The Department's technical adviser, the Office of Public Works, evaluates each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next <Col N="514" /> stage of a project, unless prior approval issues from my Department.</P>
      <P>Last December, I approved a preliminary report submitted to my Department in respect of a major refurbishment of the existing swimming pool. This approval allows the local authority to arrange the preparation of contract documentation for the project. Further consideration will be given to this proposal on receipt of this documentation. The proposed size of the adapted pool is 25 metres by 8 metres. While the estimated cost submitted at preliminary report stage was £5.4 million, 6.86 million, it is not possible to indicate up to date costs until tenders for the project have been received. As a number of other stages in the process must be completed before final approval is given to proceed with construction, it is not possible to be precise about a commencement date or an approximate building time for the project.</P>

      <P>I allocated a grant of £100,000 to the club in question under the 2000 sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department. Payment of grants of £100,000, 126,974, and over, under that programme, must be certified by my Department's technical adviser, the Office of Public Works. The Office of Public Works cannot certify payments until all aspects of health and safety regarding construction have been satisfied. In this case, a preliminary health and safety plan for the project has been approved by the Office of Public Works, but the club has not yet provided the fire safety certificate required. My Department wrote to the club on 6 July 2001 requesting the certificate. The club this week indicated that it has acquired the certificate <Col N="515" /> and has undertaken to forward it for examination immediately.</P>
      <P>A deed of trust was required for grants exceeding £39,000 under the 2000 programme. The deed of trust provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purposes for which the grant was allocated. Deeds of trust are executed by the Chief State Solicitor's office. In this particular case the deed of trust is currently being put in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 483, 485, 516, 540 and 573 together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels have now been finalised. In the case of primary schools I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40 per pupil per annum to £100 per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40 to £60 per pupil. This will be further increased to £80 per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400 to £4,800, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000 to £40,000 per annum. At second level, the extra funding will be allocated to schools under the schools services support fund that I introduced last year. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £20 per pupil to £50 per pupil per annum, with a further increase to £70 per pupil next September.</P>
      <P>These increases are in addition to the £55 per pupil at present provided to schools for secretaries and caretakers where these are not provided under separate schemes. This element of £55 is subject to a ceiling of £19,250 per school. The minimum annual grant under the services support fund for schools with 200 pupils or fewer will increase from £4,000 to £14,000 per year; while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000 to £35,000 each year. In the case of second level schools already receiving £55 per pupil for secretaries and caretakers they will, under this new scheme, also receive £70 per pupil bringing their combined total for a 500 pupil school to £54,250 per year. My Department is now arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also announced that I am immediately <Col N="517" /> appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million to respond to the recommendations of the consultants. The Deputies will also be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>

      <P>On the basis of the information available, the person to whom the question refers does not qualify for the vocational training opportunities scheme. The scheme is confined to adults over 21 who are in receipt of unemployment assistance/benefit, a one parent family payment, disability allowance/benefit or signing for credits. A person must be in receipt of one of the above allowances for at least six months in order to be eligible to join VTOS. Dependent spouses of these categories are also eligible. The main objectives of the VTOS scheme are to give unemployed people education and training opportunities which will develop their employability.</P>
      <P>The person in question is not currently in receipt of a social welfare payment, is not a dependent spouse of a person in receipt of a social welfare payment, or signing for credits, and therefore is not eligible to apply for a VTOS programme. County Sligo VEC runs post-leaving certificate programmes. The person in question may apply for one of these courses.</P>

      <P>Tá sé beartaithe agam Ceisteanna 486 agus 536 a fhreagairt le chéile.</P>
      <P>Tá béim ar leith curtha ag an Rialtas seo ar an nGaeilge mar cheist náisiúnta. I gClár Gníomhachta an Rialtais glactar leis mar cheart bunúsach go mbeadh fáil ag gach saoránach ar a chuid oidhreachta a shaibhriú trín gcóras oideachais agus i gcoitinne, trín teanga Gaeilge a fhoghlaim agus a chaomhnú chomh forleathan agus is féidir. Tá cur chun cinn na Gaeilge clúdaithe sa reachtaíocht go léir a bhaineann leis an réimse ard-oideachais. In Acht na nOllscoileanna, 1997, Acht na gColáistí Teicniúla Réigiúnacha, 1992, agus Acht Institiúid Teicneolaíochta Bhaile Átha Cliath, 1992, tá sé luaite go bhfuil sé mar dhualgas ar na hollscoileanna agus na hinstitiúidí teicneolaíochta teangacha an Stáit, go háirithe an Ghaeilge, a chur chun cinn agus a chaomhnú ionas go gcaomhnófaí cultúir éagsúla na hÉireann.</P>
      <P>Tá dualgas reachtúil ar leith ar an Údarás um Ard-Oideachas na haidhmeanna náisiúnta d'athbheochan na Gaeilge agus do chaomhnú agus d'fhorbairt an chultúir náisiúnta a choimeád i gcuimhne i gcónaí. Sa bhliain 1998 cuireadh leathmhilliún punt ar fáil don Údarás ar mhaithe le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge ag an tríú leibhéal. Chuir an soláthar speisialta seo ar chumas na n-ollscoileanna beartais nua a chumadh agus a chur i gcrích a chuir borradh breise faoin nGaeilge ag an tríú leibhéal. Cuireadh £500,000 eile ar fáil don Údarás sa bhliain 1999 agus níos mó ná £500,000 sa bhliain 2000. Ó thaobh na n-institiúidí teicneolaíochta de, thug institiúidí éagsula moltaí maidir le Gaeilge isteach don Roinn agus sa bhliain 1999 chuir an Roinn airgead ar fáil dóibh i leith na moltaí céanna. Bronnadh níos mó airgid le haghaidh forbairt na Gaeilge do na hinstitiúidí sna blianta 2000 agus 2001.</P>
      <P>Tá acmhainní soláthraithe ag mo Roinn ionas go mbeidh deontais ar leith ar fáil do mhic léinn ón nGaeltacht, do mhic léinn a chuaigh chuig Gaelscoileanna agus do dhaoine ar mian leo cúrsaí trí mheán na Gaeilge a dhéanamh. Gach bliain tairgítear 15 scoláireachtaí do mhic léinn ón nGaeltacht faoi scéim scoláireachtaí tríú leibhéal do mhic léinn ón nGaeltacht agus 15 scoláireachtaí eile do mhic léinn faoi scéim scoláíreachtaí Gaeilge tríú leibhéal.</P>
      <P>Ina theannta sin, tairgítear 20 scoláireachtaí eile ar bhunús iomaíoch do mhic léinn a bhí ag freastal ar Ghaelscoileanna agus a bhfuil fonn orthu cúrsa tríú leibhéil a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge. Is léir go bhfuil sé an-tábhachtach go mbeadh fáil ar chúrsaí trí mheán na Gaeilge ag daoine ón nGaeltacht, ag daoine eile a chuaigh chuig Gaelscoileanna agus daoine ar mian leo cúrsaí trí mheán na Gaeilge a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá roinnt cúrsaí ar fáil sna hollscoileanna agus sna hinstitiúidí teicneolaíochta faoi láthair. Tá cursaí sa Ghaeilge féin agus sa Léann Ceilteach <Col N="519" /> in ollscoileanna éagsúla. Tá cursaí trí Ghaeilge i réimse ábhar eile le fáil sna hollscoileanna agus na hinstitiuidí teicneolaíochta chomh maith. Toisc go bhfuil tábhacht na Gaeilge san oideachas rí-shoiléir ba chéim tábhachtach é cúrsa ard-teastas san oideachais a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge. Sa bhliain 1998 nuair a thosaigh an cúrsa in Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh, ghlac 39 mic léinn leis an áit a tairgíodh dóibh. Sa bhliain 1999, chuaigh Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh, chun cainte leis na hollscoileanna eile a bhfuil ceantar Gaeltachta ina n-abhantrach ar mhaithe le moltaí a dhéanamh maidir le forbairt an oideachais tríú leibhéal sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ina dhiaidh sin, bunaíodh grúpa oibre idir-ollscoile, idir Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh, Ollscoil na hÉireann Corcaigh, Ollscoil na hÉireann, Má Nuad agus Ollscoil na Ríona, Béal Feirste, le tuairimí na nOllscoileanna a fháil agus stráitéis chomtháite forbartha a aontú. I mí Bealtaine, bhuail mé le hionadaithe ó Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh, maidir le plean forbartha don oideachas tríú léibhéal sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>De bharr tábhacht an ábhair agus an méid airgid atá ag baint leis an stráitéis, is léir go mba chóir meastóireacht neamhspleách a dhéanamh ar pholasaí agus ar na tacaíochtaí reatha atá ar fáil d'oideachas tríú leibhéal sa Ghaeltacht anois. Dá bharr sin d'iarr mé ar an Údarás um Ard-Oideachas tús a chur leis an meastóireacht. Beidh Grúpa Stiúrtha Idir-Roinne i bhfeighil ar an meastóireacht seo. Is léir ón bhfianaise thuas luaite go bhfuil mé féin agus mo Roinn ag glacadh réimse leathan céimeanna chun oideachas tríú leibhéal trí mheán na Gaeilge a fhorbairt sa Ghaeltacht agus lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <P>The question relates to a person who is pursuing, or who intends to pursue, a degree in medicine in the UK. In 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. In general, the approved courses in other member states are full-time undergraduate courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. There are, however, a number of excepted courses including those in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher-training courses including those leading to the award of Bachelor of Education. Medicine is an excepted course on the basis that similar courses in Ireland are subject to a quota based on policy decisions on the appropriate levels of graduate output.</P>
      <P>Apart from this provision, the higher education grants scheme provides that students, who have previously pursued an undergraduate course approved for the purposes of the scheme, shall not receive a grant under this scheme until they have completed an equivalent period of study at undergraduate level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously. It is understood that the student in question has already completed four years study at undergraduate level. In light of both these provisions, therefore, the student, referred to by the Deputy, is ineligible for funding under the terms of the higher education grants scheme.</P>

      <P>The special rates of maintenance grant are payable only where a student is already in receipt of a maintenance grant under one of the following means tested maintenance grant schemes: the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' (VEC) scholarship scheme, third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and maintenance grants <Col N="521" /> scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
      <P>My Department understands that a full-time student who is in receipt of one of the above maintenance grants cannot, at the same time, be in receipt of an unemployment assistance payment from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. However, a student who qualifies for the standard maintenance grant and whose parent or guardian is in receipt of the long-term unemployment assistance payment may be eligible for the special rate of maintenance grant.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he will consider amending the legislative proposals in relation to the provisions in the Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001, to address concerns (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[23694/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the concerns to which the Deputy refers is that the enactment of the Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001 and the setting up of a scheme for financial redress to victims of abuse in childhood will prejudice the effectiveness of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. The view is expressed that former residents of the institutions will be encouraged to make their claim to the redress board only.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to emphasise that the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse is an entirely separate body from the proposed redress board. The commission has a function to inquire into past abuse of children in all situations, other than the family home, to establish accountability for abuse and to provide a therapeutic forum for victims of abuse to tell the story of their experience, good and bad. The redress board will provide compensation from public funds for people who were injured as a result of abuse in childhood while resident in institutions for which public bodies had regulatory and supervisory functions. Both bodies are part of the Government's response to widespread public concern about alleged abuse in the institutions in particular and are intended as going some way to serving the needs of victims of abuse in childhood. Those needs, as expressed to me and my Department, by many former residents of the institutions include the need to be believed and the need for answers as to why abuse happened to them and who were the responsible parties. They also include in some, but by no means all, cases a wish to be financially compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While appreciating the concerns expressed as coming from a genuine desire to see the commission successfully complete its work, I never<Col N="522" /> theless have to say that it is unfair to former residents of institutions to presume to know how they will act. As matters stand, the commission has a very substantial number of applications and some are already being heard. There is at present no evidence of a drift of applicants away from the commission.</P>
    <P>The second concern is that the redress board will make awards on the basis of untried and unsifted evidence. This is not the case. Any claimant before the redress board must establish firstly that he or she is suffering or has suffered some significant injury, physical or psychological. Secondly, the claimant must establish that that injury is consistent with the abuse as alleged. Both will involve significant medical and psychiatric evidence and the board itself may have assessments carried out. Awards will be made effectively on a no-fault basis and therefore it is not proposed to inquire in detail into the facts of abuse as alleged.</P>
    <P>The third concern is that Residential Institutions Redress Bill, 2001, does not include victims of abuse in day schools. As published, the Bill applies to orphanages, industrial schools and reformatory schools. The institutions concerned were those over which the State had significant supervisory or regulatory responsibilities, mainly arising under statute. While in a legal sense, the Government cannot accept liability for acts of abuse in the institutions, there nevertheless remains the fact that some children did suffer abuse while in State care and that the children concerned were separated from their parents and therefore did not enjoy normal parental care and protection. They relied to a significant extent on public bodies to protect them and it is now all too clear that, notwithstanding that duty, some children were abused.</P>
    <P>The payment of public moneys as financial redress for abuse suffered in such cases is therefore appropriate. These considerations do not apply to day schools where public bodies did not have the kind of supervisory functions, powers or duties which applied in the residential institutions and the children themselves were resident with their families. In the circumstances it is not proposed to apply public funds towards compensation in such cases.</P>
    <P>However, recent amendments to the Statutes of Limitation do recognise that a person who suffered sexual abuse in childhood may not have been in a position, due to the abuse suffered, to take legal action against the abuser. Normally a person would only have three years from the date on which he or she attained his or her majority to bring such an action. The statute now provides that the normal period of three years within which a person can bring an action will not apply where the delay in bringing the action resulted from the abuse itself such as suppressed memories of abuse. Following an amendment to the Statutes of Limitation made by this Government provision was made for persons who suffered sexual abuse and who were advised that their claims were statute barred. To assist such persons in <Col N="523" /> bringing a claim, provision was made for a special one year period, from June 2000 to June of this year, to allow them to commence actions against their abusers. As regards other kinds of abuse and the application of the statute, the Law Reform Commission have published a discussion document on the broader issue of limitation periods in those cases and are considering the issues further.</P>
    <P>Finally, one of the functions laid down in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000, requires the commission to advise the Government on the actions that may be taken to alleviate the damage suffered by persons who were abused in childhood. The commission process is open to all people who suffered abuse in childhood, except where the abuse occurred in a family home. The commission may have views on how issues of compensation for abuse in ordinary schools can be dealt with.</P>

      <P>My Department understands that the person to whom the Deputy refers has recently applied to Wexford Vocational Education Committee, the body charged with administering the scheme in this case, for grant assistance under the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses in 2001. The scheme defines a mature candidate as one who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry to an approved PLC course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the scheme, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature candidate who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from <Col N="524" /> 1 October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' incomes or address.</P>
    <P>When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the student's means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account, irrespective of the individual circumstances, in any case where the student is not categorised as an independent mature student.</P>
    <P>My Department understands that County Wexford VEC will be in direct contact shortly with the candidate regarding her eligibility for grant assistance under the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses in 2001.</P>

      <P>I have set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority issue. In the current school year there are 211 second level schools designated as disadvantaged. These schools are allocated additional teaching resources and are invited to participate in the home-school-community liaison scheme. These schools also receive additional <i>per capita</i> grants.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in January, 2001, I launched a major new programme to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The programme will run over a three year period and will cost some £26 million. It involves the creation of over 200 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils. A key condition of participation is that the additional resources must be used for the provision of holistic supports for pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
      <P>The schools being targeted were identified through a comprehensive survey of all primary schools carried out in March and April of 2000 by the Educational Research Centre on my Department's behalf. All primary schools were invited to participate and over 75% of primary schools responded with completed survey questionnaires. The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need and all schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme has separate urban and rural dimensions. In the urban dimension, 205 schools are being supported to implement a PTR of 20:1 in the Junior classes, up to and including second class, and 29:1 in senior classes over the period of the programme. Schools in areas with populations less than 1,500 people were categorised as rural. A total of 319 rural schools have been selected for inclusion in 73 clusters. Each cluster will be allocated the services of a teacher-coordinator. In addition, all of the approximately 2,300 participating primary schools under the programme will receive additional funding to be used in the provision of a range of in school and out of school <Col N="527" /> supports for the pupils concerned over the three-year period.</P>
    <P>To assist schools in making the best use of the extra resources now being provided, an enhanced support structure is being put in place to help teachers in putting the scheme into practice. The support structure will provide training in the understanding of educational disadvantage and the delivery of targeted supports. The Deputy may already be aware of other programmes in place to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level, such as the disadvantaged areas scheme, home-school-community liaison scheme, breaking the cycle pilot project, support teacher pilot project, early start pre-school programme, the 8-15 early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative. All of these programmes are monitored on an on-going basis to ensure they are achieving their aims.</P>

      <P>There are two schools in the Tallaght area included in the early start pre-school programme and four schools in the area included in the urban dimension of the breaking the cycle pilot project. These schools have been included in the schemes since the 1996-97 school year. The early start pre-school programme located in 40 schools is aimed at exposing children of pre-school age to an educational programme which will enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful educational attainment in future years. The early start pre-school programme is established at two of the junior schools in the Tallaght area and the locations were selected on the basis of priority of need across disadvantaged areas. The Deputy may be aware of the White Paper on early childhood education, <i>Ready to Learn</i>, which sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for all children aged from birth to six years.</P>
      <P>The question of developing and funding initiatives for particular pre-school sectors or the extension of the early start project to additional schools will be considered by my Department in the context of the implementation of the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The breaking the cycle pilot project was introduced in 1996 in 33 urban and 123 rural schools. The project seeks to target a programme of special supports in selected urban and rural schools, which were identified as being particularly disadvantaged through a survey of schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre at that time. The criteria under which schools were selected for inclusion in this initiative and the selection process itself, were devised and carried out by the Educational Research Centre following detailed consideration of a range of indi<Col N="529" /> cators of educational disadvantage. On the basis of these criteria and the survey outcome, schools were selected on the basis of priority of need.</P>
    <P>A further comprehensive survey of all primary schools was carried out by the Educational Research Centre in 2000 at the request of my Department. The purpose of the survey was to identify the level of concentration in each primary school of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. A number of accepted socio-economic variables, was used to compute an index of disadvantage for each school surveyed. The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need. The survey outcome forms the basis of the new programme, giving children an even break, which I announced in January last to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level over a three year period.</P>
    <P>All of the schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the programme. Over 2,300 primary schools, including the four schools referred to by the Deputy, have been selected to receive additional supports for the delivery of targeted in school and out of school actions under the new programme. The operation of the breaking the cycle pilot project is being closely monitored by my Department and is being evaluated by the Educational Research Centre. The future of the project as a model of addressing educational disadvantage in urban and rural settings will be considered in the light of the findings in the evaluation report which is due at the end of 2001 and in the context of the range of measures now being provided to schools under the new programme.</P>

      <P>Bus Éireann is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the school transport scheme. It is required to make the necessary local arrangements in the most economic way possible. In general, this involves children being collected at the school at the end of the full school day. Under the rules of my Department pupils in infant classes may have a school day that is one hour shorter than the length of the normal school day. This is a concession in the interests of young children and allows for a perceived inability on their part to sustain the work of the full day. It is a matter for the board of management of a particular school to decide whether the concession should be applied in the case of its school or not. If pupils in infant classes are being given a shorter day their parents should be notified to collect them at time of dismissal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 509 and 576 together.</P>
      <P>The schemes of student support define a mature candidate as one who is at least 23 years of age on 1 of January of the year of entry to an approved course. Under the terms of the schemes, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from 1 October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>When assessing the means of students, other than independent mature students, the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account, irrespective of the individual circumstances, in any case where the student is not categorised as an independent mature student.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the student referred to by the Deputy in his first question, my Department understands from County Waterford VEC, the body charged with administering the scheme in this case, that the student was not 23 years of age on 1 January of the year she entered her course. <Col N="532" /> She must, therefore, be assessed with reference to her parents' income. County Waterford VEC has further confirmed that the student in question was awarded 50% of the adjacent rate of grant in the academic year 2000-01. In the event that there is no change in circumstances, including reckonable income, and that she continues to meet the other conditions of the scheme, she will continue to receive this rate of grant for 2001-02.</P>
    <P>In relation to the student referred to by the Deputy in his second question, my Department understands that this student has recently submitted an application to County Waterford VEC under the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses 2001. It is further understood that he was subsequently requested by the VEC to submit additional details relating to his application. When his application has been processed, the VEC will contact him directly with regard to his eligibility for grant assistance under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has received correspondence from the board of management of St. Mary's Boys School, Carrigtwohill, County Cork. The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The current staffing of the school in question is a principal and five mainstream class teachers based on the enrolment of 156 pupils on 30 September 2000. This is the authorised staffing for the 2001/2002 school year. The staffing schedule for primary schools for the 2001/2002 school year is outlined in circular 12/01. In addition, the school has a learning support teacher and a resource teacher for Travellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school in question has been included in the rural dimension of the new programme &ndash; giving children an even break &ndash; which I launched in January last to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. Schools participating in the new programme are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of <Col N="533" /> pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. The school has been allocated supplementary grant aid of £879 for the 2000/2001 school year towards providing additional educational supports for the pupils concerned. On the same basis, the school will be allocated supplementary grant aid in respect of the current school year.</P>
    <P>In the case of rural schools with the highest concentration of pupils with characteristics associated with educational disadvantage, it is proposed to cluster these schools and appoint a teacher/co-ordinator to each cluster. The school in question was not considered eligible for clustering based on the level of concentration of at-risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has taken effective action to boost substantially the supply of trained primary teachers. The total intake to the Colleges of Education for primary teaching in the 2000-2001 academic year was increased to 1,282. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are approximately 1,000 students again enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2001-2002 academic year. The intake to the undergraduate training course for primary teachers will continue at the current level of 1,000 for the 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 academic years. In addition negotiations are taking place with the colleges of education for the provision of a further postgraduate course next year. Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers graduated. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
      <P>Other initiatives to increase the number of trained personnel have also been introduced. B.Ed graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification are now recognised as fully qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since September 1998, all primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education are paid as fully trained substitute teachers. Since September 2000 teachers employed in a temporary capacity holding a degree and the higher diploma in education are paid on the trained basic scale for teachers. Teachers trained in EU countries employed in primary schools are now remunerated at the trained rate pending their <Col N="534" /> obtaining the necessary competence in the Irish language. EU-trained teachers now have up to five years to obtain the necessary competence in the language. In addition, for the period of two years from 1 September 2000 teachers trained outside the EU, whose qualifications are accepted by my Department, will be granted provisional recognition for five years on the same basis as EU trained teachers.</P>
    <P>Montessori-trained teachers who successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, or the Montessori qualification, which is awarded on completion of the three-year full-time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully-qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools and classes.</P>
    <P>The decision to recognise fully-qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without needing to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor the position regarding the availability of trained teachers in primary schools. The recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee referred to by the Deputy will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>There are currently 5,000 approved places for the vocational training opportunities scheme &ndash; VTOS. Until recently this figure has met the overall demand on a national level, but there has been a significant increase in demand for places by the vocational education committees since last year. At this stage, all places allocated have been filled. County Cavan VEC was initially allocated 40 VTOS places for the academic year 2001/2. An additional ten places have since been given to this VEC, bringing its total allocation to 50 places, all of which are being provided for students attending post leaving certificate programmes, PLCs.</P>
      <P>Applicants who are at least 21 years of age, and in receipt of relevant social welfare payments also have the option of attending these PLC programmes under the back to education allowance scheme, BTEA. This scheme is administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, with participants receiving an allowance in lieu of their social welfare payment from that Department.</P>
      <P>The back to education initiative, as set out in the recent White Paper on Adult Education &ndash; Learning for Life &ndash; proposes to expand VTOS, youthreach, PLC and senior Traveller training programme on a part-time basis. The intention is that this new initiative will address the increased demand for places, and provide flexibility in provision of programmes to meet the demands of adults wishing to return to education and training. Some 4,000 additional part-time places will come on stream at the end of the year.</P>

      <P>My Department understands that the person, referred to by the Deputy, applied to Galway County Council, the body charged with administering the scheme in this case, for grant assistance under the higher education grants scheme, 2001. Galway County Council has confirmed to my Department that the reckonable income in her case exceeds the prescribed income limits as set out in the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is understood that a question arises as to the status of a change in the reckonable income in this case. The scheme provides that the eligibility of a person may be assessed or re-assessed by the local authority in the event of changes of circumstances relating to the candidate's reckonable income which is likely to be permanent, that is, likely to obtain for the duration of the approved course or for the foreseeable future. This is, however, a matter for consideration by the relevant local authority.</P>

      <P>The statistical information the Deputy requires is not readily available. However, the issue of attrition rates has been a matter of concern for some time, and a significant amount of work has been done in the area. Quantitative research has been undertaken in the universities and the institutes of technology. A Study of Non-completion in Undergraduate University Courses was undertaken by the Educational Research Centre or ERC at the request of the Higher Education Authority. The report found an overall non-completion rate of 16.8% for all first-time entrants to university undergraduate courses in the academic year 1992-93. The non-completion rates recorded by the report for each of the universities based on the 1992-93 cohort are as follows:</P>

    <P>At the request of my Department, the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology also commissioned the ERC to undertake a comprehensive study on the issue of non-completion in institute of technology courses. The Dublin Institute of Technology also conducted a similar study. A Study of Non-completion In Institute of Technology Courses examined the completion rates for first-time entrants to eleven institutes of technology in 1995. The study shows an overall non-completion rate of 42.61% across the institutes surveyed.

    <P>The results of the Dublin Institute of Technology study indicate an overall non-completion rate of 39.46% for the 1994 cohort of full-time first year students pursuing courses in the institute. In dealing with attrition rates, there is a need to develop an inter-institutional tracking system. The Higher Education Authority is developing an oracle-based data system to store detailed student-related data. In this regard, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a system to facilitate the identification of cases where students fail to progress to the next year of a course. In the institute of technology sector, a computerised management information systems project is currently being developed. The aim of the project is to support the efficient administration of the institutes of technology, and, when operational, the system will provide enhanced information on attrition rates.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. Responsibility for the operation of community employment schemes in schools lies with FÁS. In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, I recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis as the FÁS school-based CE schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post-primary levels have now been finalised. My Department will provide funding for caretakers and secretaries to schools and the employment of secretaries and caretakers will be a matter for individual boards of management. In the case of primary <Col N="540" /> schools, I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40 per pupil per annum to £100 per pupil over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40 to £60 per pupil. This will be further increased to £80 per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400 to £4,800, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000 to £40,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>My Department is now arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second-level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    <P>I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school-based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools. In dealing with attrition rates, there is a need to develop an inter-institutional tracking system. The Higher Education Authority is developing an oracle-based data system to store detailed student-related data. In this regard, work is ongoing in relation to the development of a system to facilitate the identification of cases where students fail to progress to the next year of a course.

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.</P>
      <P>The schools referred to by the Deputy share the services of a full-time secretary under the 1978-79 scheme. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my officials will be writing to all schools involved in sharing arrangements shortly, outlining proposals to allocate the post in its entirety to one of the schools concerned. The other school will then become eligible for additional funding under a more extensive grant scheme that was introduced in the PESP Agreement in 1992. The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>

      <P>The percentage appeal rate is in fact <Col N="543" /> very low. At this year's leaving certificate examination approximately 390,000 grades were issued to candidates. The number of grades appealed was 8,955, which represents only about 2% of the grades awarded. This is a very small proportion of the total grades awarded and reflects the fact that our examination system is acknowledged to be one of the most open, transparent and pro-candidate national examination systems in the world.</P>
      <P>A cornerstone of the openness and transparency of the system is the access candidates have to their marked examination scripts and the detailed marking schemes that were applied to them. As a result, candidates are in a position to inform themselves regarding the accuracy of the marking and then to make an informed decision regarding the need to appeal. Clearly because students have an opportunity to view their scripts, the likelihood is that only those who believe that there are reasonable grounds for an appeal will seek one. This is reflected in the fact that since the introduction of the viewing option the number of appeal applications has reduced significantly.</P>
      <P>In the processing of appeals, the work of each candidate is fully marked question by question. A fundamental feature of the appeal process is that a different examiner to the one who originally marked the work performs remarking.</P>

      <P>The management authorities at the Patrician college, Ballyfin, recently indicated to my Department that they were not in a position to continue to provide second level education in Ballyfin college. Accordingly, they proposed to cease first year enrolments from September 2002 and to close the school in June 2005.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I support the joint proposal by the secondary school trustees and County Laois Vocational Education Committee for an amalgamation of Ballyfin college and the vocational school in Portlaoise into a community college under the aegis of County Laois VEC. The proposed amalgamation of these two schools will guarantee the option of co-education in the area, in greatly enhanced facilities, and will also provide an option for employment for the permanent staff of Ballyfin college. The implementation of this proposal will be addressed in the context of the building project which is currently under way.</P>

The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 55 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 51 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment entitles the school to a staffing of a principal and two mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. I understand that one of the two mainstream class teachers in the school is on secondment at present. In accordance with standard procedure, the board of management has employed a temporary teacher for the duration of the secondment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that since September 2000 all schools are now in receipt of funding in respect of caretaking and secretarial services. My Department provides funding towards the cost of these services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities.</P>
      <P>This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme. The PESP scheme provides additional per-capita grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>
      <P>I recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding has enabled me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year. Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels have now been finalised. My Department will provide funding for caretakers and secretaries to schools and the employment of secretaries and caretakers will be a matter for individual boards of management. In the case of primary schools I am increasing the grant for caretakers and secretaries from £40 per pupil per annum to £100 over this school year and the next. With immediate effect, the grant will be increased from £40 to £60 per pupil. This will be further increased to £80 per pupil in January. As a result, the minimum grant to be paid to schools with 60 pupils or less will increase from £2,400 to £4,800, while schools with 500 pupils or more will increase from £20,000 to £40,000 per annum rising to £50,000 the following year.</P>
      <P>My Department is now arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second level schools outlining details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
      <P>I have also announced that I am immediately appointing consultants to examine and advise on transitional arrangements that may affect some schools during the process of the withdrawal of CE schemes. I am setting aside £2 million to respond to the recommendations of the consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>

      <P>Like other training programmes for early school leavers, the senior Traveller training programme is delivered in an out-of-school setting in rented premises. Essential refurbishment of these premises has to be met within the annual budget for the running costs of the programme as allocated through the public service Estimates. The chief executive officer of County Carlow VEC has written to my Department's further education section seeking approval for expenditure of £450,000 to restructure and refurbish the premises which houses St. Catherine's Senior Travellers Training Centre. If the VEC submits a priority list of essential work, in particular, work that has health and/or safety implications, to upgrade the premises on a phased basis, my Department will fully consider the matter.</P>

      <P>I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes come to an end. In the discussions that took place in connection with the transfer of funding, I agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school-based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
      <P>I am aware that FÁS has issued guidelines to its regional offices that reflect the agreement I have referred to above. In the case referred to by the Deputy it appears that the person in question should be entitled to complete the third year of her community employment in the school in which she is currently based. In the circumstances it appears to me that the person in question should contact her local FÁS office and seek to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, schools that used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of <Col N="559" /> pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils <Col N="560" /> with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from the special education section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>
