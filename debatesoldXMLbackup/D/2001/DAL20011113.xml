      <P>Before proceeding with Question Time, I have the honour to extend a warm welcome to a parliamentary delegation from the Senate of Belgium led by Senator Phillippe Mahoux, accompanied by officials from the Senate, who join us in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery this afternoon.</P>
      <P>Your visit demonstrates the continuing co-operation and friendship between our two Parliaments and countries. I confidently hope this visit will increase that co-operation and friendship, and that it will be to our mutual benefit.</P>

      <P>At the end of Question Time last week when there was some discussion of tolls, and particularly of the issue of where the power to approve toll schemes resides, I indicated that I understood the approval of toll schemes was a matter for the Minister for Environment and Local Government. I wish to clarify for the House that while the Minister had this role previously, the approval of national road toll schemes is now a matter for the National Roads Authority, under the terms of the new legislation introduced with effect from the beginning of the year. I refer to Part 20 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that Judge Barron and his team continued with their work over the summer months and they are continuing to make progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of concerns about the delay in receiving material from the British auth<Col N="1287" /> orities. I raised this matter directly with both the British Prime Minister Mr. Blair and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid, earlier in the summer. I also had the matter raised again recently through the British-Irish secretariat. The British Government is, therefore, very well aware of our interest in this matter. At Mr. Justice Barron's request, I wrote to Dr. Reid recently supporting the judge's request for a meeting with him, and Dr. Reid has confirmed that he will meet Mr. Justice Barron. Contact has been made between the commission and the Secretary of State's office to find a suitable date for a meeting, which it is expected will be soon.</P>
    <P>As to the timing of the completion of the report, this is a matter entirely for Mr. Justice Barron and would be linked to the response of the British authorities to his request regarding material.</P>
    <P>I met the Justice for the Forgotten group briefly on Tuesday, 25 September, in advance of its meeting with Mr. Justice Barron, and I fully appreciate its concerns. The group had the opportunity to discuss its concerns directly with Mr. Justice Barron.</P>
    <P>I understand the question of an interim report has not been considered. All sides would wish that Mr. Justice Barron's report should be as comprehensive as possible, taking account of all the available evidence from all sources, in order to achieve our objective of getting to the truth of what happened.</P>
    <P>The costs to date relating to the independent commission of inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings amount to £350,084, or 444,515.</P>
    <P>The Government has also facilitated the legal engagement by the group, Justice for the Forgotten, which represents the relatives and victims of the bombings, with the independent commission of inquiry, and the costs incurred to date in this regard amount to £486,252 or 617,412.</P>
    <P>The total costs which have arisen, therefore, in relation to the current examination of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings amount to £836,336 or 1,061,927.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Justice for the Forgotten group has launched a new campaign, based on its view that the British Government is not co-operating with Mr. Justice Barron and that after nine months a document relevant to the inquiry has emerged from the British Government files? I acknowledge that the Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, has now agreed to meet Mr. Justice Barron. However, when the Taoiseach raised this matter with the British Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland did they give an explanation as to why after nine months no progress has been made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the campaign and I understand it. It was discussed on 25 September when I had a meeting with the full group <Col N="1288" /> of relatives, Justice for the Forgotten, and their legal representatives prior to the meeting with Judge Barron.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter a number of times in one form and another with Prime Minister Blair, Dr. Reid and officials of the secretariat. I have written more recently and received a reply, as Deputy Noonan has acknowledged. Last March, Dr. Reid reaffirmed to me the British Government's commitment to treating all requests from the inquiry sympathetically. He indicated that all relevant UK Government Departments had been searching their records, that the search was nearing completion and that he hoped to be in a position to soon respond substantively to Mr. Justice Barron's request. Subsequently, we pursued the matter with Prime Minister Blair and Dr. Reid and, formally, through the secretariat.</P>
      <P>The Justice for the Forgotten group has expressed frustration because of its belief that it would not get a reply. Naturally, the Government wants Mr. Justice Barron to be in a position to report as soon as possible but he has indicated it is critical he receives the information he has requested. We have not had a commitment regarding that aspect but we have a commitment that there will be a meeting.</P>
      <P>Given what has happened over the past seven to eight months, I hope, but I cannot be certain &ndash; I do not wish to mislead the House &ndash; that if records are not found replies will be made to the substantive questions put by Mr. Justice Barron over the past six to nine months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's reply is very unsatisfactory, probably because the information provided by the British Government is equally unsatisfactory. To summarise the position, over nine months ago the British Government said it would treat with sympathy any request put to it by Mr. Justice Barron. He immediately requested information on security or other files in relation to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, yet nothing has happened since by way of reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Taoiseach raised this matter with Dr. Reid and Prime Minister Blair did he seek a progress report? If there is an enormous number of security files which will take a long time to research, one would have thought the British Government would have <i>seriatim</i> supplied what becomes available as soon as it is found. It is self-evident that primary files would be in the possession of the British Government dealing with the Dublin and Monaghan bombings because they entailed major loss of life and had major security and political implications, north and south of the Border. Any of us in Government knows that on first receiving a request the primary files can be found. A partial explanation for the delay would be the necessity to examine individually the possibly hundreds of thousands of security files compiled following 30 years of troubles in Northern Ireland. However, the British Government must be in possession of primary files which contain relevant information where it <Col N="1289" /> formed a view on what caused the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.</P>
    <P>There appears to be foot-dragging here. The Taoiseach must take responsibility for the Government and ensure&mdash;</P>

      <P>A question for the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that he should take responsibility on behalf of the Government and all victims on all parts of this island to ensure that this matter is resolved in a satisfactory manner and that information in possession of the British Government is provided to Mr. Justice Barron forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan and have no argument with what he has said. There must be records of some description. While this is an independent tribunal, I am aware that Mr. Justice Barron has been specific about what he seeks. It does not require a check on every available file. I am not sure what files and records are available but I doubt if that is the problem. If it was we would have obtained some of the records because we have been pressing the issue since early last spring.</P>
      <P>I have indicated to the British at various levels, including Prime Minister Blair, the Secretary of State, officials and, formally, the British-Irish Secretariat in writing, that the commission of inquiry which I set up with the support of the House is undertaking a thorough examination involving fact-finding, assessment, all aspects of the bombings and their sequel, facts, circumstances, causes, the perpetrators, investigations into the bombings, including those carried out by the Garda, co-operation with relevant Northern Ireland authorities, including the RUC, the handling of evidence, the reasons no prosecutions took place, whether the investigations were impeded and the evidence from the &ldquo;Hidden Hand&rdquo; television documentary. I understand Justice Barron has moved on all these issues, but has not got what he requires from the British. I have some reason to believe, but cannot be certain, that it has been discussed fairly comprehensively within the British system a number of times recently. I say this because when I raised it with the Secretary of State and Prime Minister they were well aware of the issues and well briefed. I hope this meeting will lead to answers and conclusions.</P>
      <P>I assume there are records as if they did not exist I am sure they would have written last March saying so &ndash; that would have been the easy thing to do. For some reason they have not dispatched those records, but Mr. Justice Barron is very clear and determined in what he is seeking. All of us, including the Justice for the Forgotten group, are supporting him. This is the first time anything has been done since May 1974 and we want to see Justice Barron get access to whatever is available, or at least get answers to his questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach fully appreciate the sense of frustration being experienced by Justice for the Forgotten which has endured almost 30 years of lack of knowledge about what happened to their loved ones? Will he accept this sense of loss is compounded by the feeling that this attempt to finally get the truth is being frustrated? Does he share the view that the British Government is being unco-operative with the Barron inquiry? Does he also share the view that the inquiry in terms of resources and supports pales into insignificance when one looks at another great tragedy, that of Bloody Sunday, and the resources, focus, attention and openness with which that is being investigated? Regarding the process, it was originally envisaged that the independent report when available would go to a committee of the House. Is that still the position? Will the Taoiseach spell out exactly the process and timeframe he envisages in terms of finally getting the truth about these terrible deeds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Howlin has asked three questions. There is a sense of frustration on the part of the relatives who have had to wait 25 years before anything happened. They now have an opportunity to see the issue dealt with. They have worked very closely with Mr. Justice Barron. They have been very co-operative and supportive of him and they see this as their chance to get justice and the truth in so far as the inquiry can be successful in that regard given the lapse of time. I hope the fact that the Secretary of State is to meet Mr. Justice Barron will remove the obstacle that has existed for several months. Mr. Justice Barron cannot, and I think is not prepared to, complete his report without getting the fullest and most comprehensive set of answers and details from the British system. He has been exhaustive in his efforts in regard to the Irish system, to which he is entitled. I am pleased the Secretary of State has finally agreed to meet him and I hope he will be provided with the information necessary to assist him in the work. Both gentlemen must agree a date and I understand the meeting will take place shortly.</P>
      <P>In regard to process, Deputy Howlin is correct that is still the position. When Mr. Justice Barron's report is completed it will be brought to the relevant committee of the House and a correct course of action will be decided. Members will recall that when we discussed the issue two years ago the question was raised whether there should be a more full inquiry or whether it would lead to a clear position. That is a call to be made on another day when we receive Mr. Justice Barron's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the discussions the Taoiseach had with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the nature of the discussions he proposes to have with Mr. Justice Barron, is it to fine tune the request for information or to make an explanation as to why the information has not been forthcoming to date?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know. Mr. Justice Barron has acted independently on this issue, as did the late Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton. I have a general idea of what is being sought but I do not know the specifics. I know from meeting the relatives that Mr. Justice Barron is quite clear about what he is seeking to achieve. I do not know if the Secretary of State is in a position to hand over information or whether for some reason he will not hand it over. I am sure when the two gentlemen sit down together at least progress will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Taoiseach's views on the length of time Mr. Justice Barron can wait for the information? Would it be wise to set a deadline for the information to be passed over? Will the Taoiseach agree a cloud of suspicion hangs over the whole process because of the unacceptable delay? The Justice for the Forgotten committee is becoming very concerned that the information will be passed over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as possible is my answer to the question because there have been unacceptable delays. The Garda, the Department of Defence and other Departments have made an enormous amount of information available in the past two years to allow this independent work take place. This is a sifting through everything exercise, meeting people and following up matters as much as possible. I understand it would be very helpful if Mr. Justice Barron could receive replies to his requests. Perhaps that would open up other areas he wishes to look into. He is adamant he needs information in this regard. I presume he has gleaned the information required from our records. The Garda, the Army and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have made available an enormous amount of files relating back to May 1974. I am sure the questions are related and cross-related to that information. To get a complete picture and find out what was going on during those years, and subsequently for that matter, Mr. Justice Barron will need as much information as possible from the Northern Ireland Office or Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the ever-widening co-operation between the Irish and British Governments, does the Taoiseach accept that for many interested observers it is either unacceptable or incredulous that the Government has no knowledge of the exact reason for the refusal of the British authorities to co-operate with this inquiry? Does the Taoiseach share the view of many people that it is likely that key players in these very sad and tragic events are now very senior members of the British military establishment? On a related issue, does the Taoiseach acknowledge that there has been continuing disappointment that other similar and related events, involving British collusion in that period, were not included in the remit of the Barron inquiry? I refer specifically to the bombing in <Col N="1292" /> Castleblayney, County Monaghan, in March 1976 and the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973.</P>
      <P>Taking on board the very welcome recommendations of the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, in his report of the victims' commission, in which he recommended access to all reports and investigations of such tragedies related to the conflict in the North of Ireland over the past 30 years, when will we see action, which is long overdue, on this and other recommendations in Mr. Wilson's report? When will procedures be put in place so that light can be shed on all these events, including the murder, in my county, of the late John Francis Green in 1975? I believe that if all the facts of that case were made public, it would show a link to shadowy figures associated with all the other events which we are currently discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first issue, while there have been delays, Dr. Reid has not refused but has said he will deal sympathetically with the requests. I accept it is not unreasonable for people to express concern that, as of November, there has been no further development following that undertaking which was given last March, but I hope the matter will be dealt with. With regard to the bombings in Dublin, Castleblayney and some other individual cases, the Government has no difficulty in terms of the inquiry looking at some of those matters. In some cases, other than those mentioned by the Deputy, the families concerned, for their own legal reasons, do not want the matter dealt with in that way and continue to seek an inquiry. In the cases to which the Deputy referred, there is no difficulty in having the papers looked at but we would prefer to complete the present process first.</P>
      <P>With regard to the role of the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, his preliminary report has been published and is available in this House. Further work is being done on some aspects of that, including his recommendation that some matters be considered from a judicial point of view. Action has been taken, or will be taken, on some of his other recommendations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>Does the Taoiseach agree that, nine months after the request for information was submitted to the British Government on foot of the inquiry and a full 27 years after the atrocities were carried out in Dublin and Monaghan, it is simply not good enough that even at this stage a major report has not yet been presented by the British Government? Will the <Col N="1293" /> Taoiseach agree that the Dublin and Monaghan bombings were carried out by a ruthless terrorist organisation? There may or may not have been State collusion. In that sense, though different in scale, it is not too different from the atrocity of 11 September.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain or has he questioned why, in the two months since 11 September, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, has found the time to fly around the world, put together a coalition to bomb Afghanistan in pursuit of various objectives, including the arrest of a suspect in that bombing, and yet he has not found it possible to expedite the information that this Government and our people seek in regard to getting to the bottom of an atrocity about which his forces will perhaps know much? Is it not time that the Government made a public statement to put pressure on the British Prime Minister along these lines, lest we are back here again in the springtime putting the same questions to the same Taoiseach, without being any further forward?</P>
      <P>In regard to such information or an agreement between the Irish and British Governments or between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, is it true, as claimed in <i>Ireland on Sunday </i>on 28 October, that agreement was worked out between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, that the identities of five intelligence operatives of the British state, who may know something about these tragic events, would be identified to the inquiry and is there any substance to the claim in that newspaper that those names have been handed over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the first question, as I have said, we are two years into our work and we, in this House, must be conscious that it took a quarter of a century before anything happened in this State. We should not be too righteous about time lost elsewhere.</P>
      <P>We have much ground to make up and are doing so. The Secretary of State, Mr. John Reid, has agreed to expedite matters and will meet Mr. Justice Barron. Although I cannot be sure, I hope that will remove the obstacles that exist. As I said in response to Deputy Noonan, although I may have some ideas or feelings as to why those obstacles are there, I do not know for sure so there is no point in speculating. We will have to wait and see how the meeting goes.</P>
      <P>I do not want to lose any more time. Many of the relatives are aged and many have suffered long and hard enough. Neither Mr. Justice Barron nor I have any interest in delaying progress on that and I am sure the same is true of the British Government.</P>
      <P>As regards speculation, I have read the article mentioned by Deputy Higgins. I will not speculate on any of those issues. There has been much speculation and that has been written in articles.</P>

It is not at that stage whatsoever. That could be interpreted as suggesting that Mr. Justice Barron had got all this information, but he has not.

      <P>In the Taoiseach's reply, he said that when he spoke to Mr. Blair, the Prime Minister was well aware of the issues. What response did he get from Mr. Blair to the issues? Did he get an assurance that full co-operation would be given to the Barron inquiry? Did Mr. Blair say when that co-operation would be carried through? If he did not ask those specific questions, would he get clarity on these issues from Mr. Blair at their next meeting, especially given the concern he has expressed about terrorism in recent weeks? I expect him to be concerned about the single worst act of terrorism against the people of Dublin and Monaghan in the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there has always been a serious question mark over the 1974 bombings in so far as loyalist paramilitaries, even today almost 30 years later, are only capable of the crudest form of pipe bomb and, thankfully, have never achieved before or since the technology, the timing devices and so on that were a feature of 1974? May it not prove to be the case that elements of the British military establishment were most likely the only source available to the loyalists for such terrorist devices, and that this is the real reason behind the delay, prevarication and lack of co-operation so far from the British authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the questions that he wishes me to raise, and addressed them already. The response from the British Government is that it will treat sympathetically, all requests from Mr. Justice Barron, and Mr. Justice Hamilton. Mr. Blair indicated to me that the relevant UK Government ministries are searching their records and retrieval systems and that this is nearing completion. He hopes to be in a position to respond substantively to Mr. Justice Barron's request and the Secretary of State will follow this up. There have been discussions at a senior level with the British side and Mr. Justice Barron will meet Dr. Reid who will give a response. He knows the issues involved because Mr. Justice <Col N="1295" /> Barron has been pursuing these matters for several months.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory is correct in saying there is much speculation about the other matters raised by him, such as how a sophisticated bombing device came to be used in May 1974. Mr. Justice Barron is trying to get to the truth, to find out what happened, who was involved and who co-operated with whom, and what facts can be uncovered. There is no point in my speculating on it. There has been speculation for 27 years but now we want hard facts and then we will see what follows from that. As I said earlier to Deputy Howlin, under the agreed arrangements, the published report of the commission of inquiry will be considered in public session by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The committee may then advise that the truth can only be discovered through a public inquiry, or that its sub-committee should examine the matter, or that the report discovered what truth could be discovered and that no further action would be required or fruitful. These are the decisions that must be made then, but there is no point in speculating before that. I hope we get to that time as soon as possible.</P>

I put it to him that it is also true that he is losing credibility on this issue because of the long delay and the British Government is certainly beginning to lose credibility because of the long delay.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he was quite confident the British administration, at a very senior level, had discussed this. Even the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, was fully conversant with the issues when the Taoiseach raised them with him. Did Mr. Blair just say they were very sorry for the delay? In discussions between Prime Ministers, it would be normal to pursue the question and ask why there was a delay, what is causing it and if there is a difficulty in producing the information. The Taoiseach is not being frank with the House. The Taoiseach must have got some explanation from the British Prime Minister if he has a relationship of equality with him. What explanation did the Taoiseach get?</P>

      <P>I can tell the House that nothing had been done and that is why I have been so anxious to pursue this. There was no investigation here, there was no investigation in the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or Foreign Affairs, there was no investigation within the Garda and there was no investigation of files, and that is not to mention the British system. Before we get high and mighty and criticise the British &ndash; which I have done for nine months anyway &ndash; I do not think we should be too strong on this. Examining the records of what happened from 1974 until recently can be sad. That is by the way, it is history now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan is right, the normal practice would be to pursue the issue with the British Prime Minister. I pursued the issue and did so a number of times. I do not know the reason the records have not been handed over. I assume there are records there because otherwise they would have written back saying they are not there.</P>

      <P>The explanation Prime Minister Blair gave was that he would instruct that all the records, in all of the relevant departments, be examined and whatever was there would be dealt with by the secretary of state. I have reason to believe the secretary of state has been active. I do not know why the British system has not handed over whatever its has found, or at least given replies. It has its own legal system, perhaps it is a question of legal advice, but it has not given a reason. It has stated it will conduct an examination of the records, treat the matter sympathetically and be co-operative. Even though there has been a delay we have to take those involved on their word that they are will do that. We had to press hard to get Mr. Justice Barron a meeting with the secretary of the state, Dr. Reid, but we have now achieved that. That has taken some time. We will have to wait and see what Mr. Justice Barron receives from that meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that the delay of 27 years is unacceptable. Does he agree that, in international terms, it is deplorable <Col N="1297" /> and bizarre that this debate and these questions are being asked so long after the worst mass murder of the troubles of the past 30 years?</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach given any thought to a proposal my party made at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation that there may come a time when we will need a truth commission, such as that set up in South Africa, to help uncover some of the truths which seem determined to lie hidden regarding this and other unresolved atrocities? Does he agree that, not only the sophistication of the car bombs of 1974, but also the timing of the atrocity when anti-terrorism legislation was before the Dáil, continues to cast significant suspicion on British security forces? Have these suspicions been put to the British Prime Minister, in whose interest it would seem to be to get to the bottom of this issue, given the lingering cloud of suspicion which hangs over the British establishment regarding this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The British Government has moved on what is probably a far more difficult case for it, namely, Bloody Sunday, regarding which it has had to open up on arrangements and so on. I am not suggesting that one is worse than the other &ndash; they are all bad &ndash; but once it has done so it should not fear moving on these issues.</P>
      <P>People wish to move on and to try to find the truth as best they can. That is also the case with the Justice for the Forgotten group which wishes to see this saga closed. That is what it has tried to achieve for 27 years. I found them to be reasonable people and, in so far as we can, I wish to get to the bottom of this. They are reasonable people who wish to live out their lives, but they wish to see that those who died and those who were injured and maimed for life, are not forgotten. I have some sympathy with their views.</P>
      <P>The issue of a truth commission has been raised in the past seven or eight years since the first ceasefire. I can argue this both ways, but there is no great support for this proposal on either side. There is a feeling that one could get into an endless period of going back over cases. I have been at sessions in the North where this issue has been debated around and around. Some believe it could be helpful. However, others have examined what happened in South Africa. The conclusion &ndash; I am not suggesting it is a definitive one &ndash; but, more or less, the conclusion is that it is probably not the best approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, there are significant demands for investigations into different cases. The Deputy will be aware of the argument regarding the Northern Ireland Police Authority and the issue which arose during the police Bill concerning the look back period. This has been the big issue. Going forward I do not wish to say people will forget this in ten years' time. I do not think they will because in any of these meetings &ndash; I do not like putting it in terms of sides &ndash; but either side can rattle off, <i>ad nauseum</i>, the ferociousness of many of the horrendous events which have affected its community. Many of the groups such <Col N="1298" /> as British Irish Rights Watch, Amnesty International and others relate to a number of the issues which have happened on either side which killed people from both sides. The experiences of the Bloody Sunday tribunal or other issues such as the Nelson and Finucane cases and the Bloody Friday initiatives will, perhaps, satisfy people not to go down this road in all of these cases. That is the current position.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I feel that, as years go by, people will continue to look back on some of these issues. There are many unanswered questions on all sides about many of these issues.</P>

We have a commitment that a trawl is being carried out but whether that trawl will lead us to the information is another question. I hope it will. We will continue to work with the Justice for the Forgotten group. It has been patient. The British Government knows full well that Mr. Justice Barron and this House are getting frustrated by the wait. We will bring that to their attention again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, section 47 of the Coroners Act, 1962, provides that where a coroner is informed by a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of inspector, that in his opinion the death of any person whose body has been buried in the coroner's district may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner, the coroner may request the Minister to order the exhumation of the body by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm to the Deputies that a request in accordance with section 47(2) of the Coroners Act was received from the coroner for Donegal South East on 27 June 2001 in respect of the late Mr. Barron and that an exhumation order issued on 3 July 2001. For the sake of completeness, I should mention that on 10 October 1997, the <Col N="1300" /> senior Garda superintendent charged with the investigation into the death of the late Mr. Barron forwarded a request from the coroner for an exhumation order based on a request made by the superintendent to the coroner. The necessary papers, an exhumation order and other related papers, were prepared by the staff of the Department to authorise the exhumation. However, on 16 October 1997 the same Garda officer telephoned the Department and asked that his request for an exhumation order be put on hold until further notice. In the circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that it would have been inappropriate for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take further action in relation to the exhumation order request. No further action was taken in relation to the request for the exhumation order until a further request for an exhumation order in the case was received from the coroner for Donegal South East, associated with a fresh request from the Garda, on 27 June 2001.</P>
    <P>For my part, I have not seen the results of the exhumation nor, indeed, would it be appropriate for me to do so. The results of the exhumation form part of the criminal investigation and, as such, they are being considered by the Garda investigating the death of Mr. Barron. As Deputies will appreciate, the investigation of a crime is an operational matter for the Garda authorities. I have been informed, however, by the Garda authorities that, notwithstanding the conduct of a post-mortem on the exhumed body, there is no conclusive evidence to indicate how the deceased met his death. While I have not seen the pathologist's report, in line with normal practice, I understand that the pathologist has expressed the view that the injuries sustained by the deceased could be consistent with his being struck by a vehicle. I understand that the pathologist also acknowledges that another pathologist might well take a different view. The circumstances surrounding the death of the person concerned is the subject of an ongoing Garda investigation. I now want to deal with the question of a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>The death of Mr. Barron took place in October 1996 and the subsequent Garda investigation lead to a file being submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions. No prosecution was initiated on foot of this file. Early in 1999 Assistant Commissioner Carty initiated his investigation into matters in Donegal. This investigation was comprehensive and covered a variety of different matters. In particular it looked at the Garda investigation into Mr. Barron's death, allegations of harassment and allegations that certain gardaí were involved in &ldquo;hoax&rdquo; bomb-making equipment finds. In the summer of 2000, Assistant Commissioner Carty submitted the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration. I am informed by the Garda authorities that, to date, five persons have been arrested and charged and more prosecutions may follow.</P>
    <P>Two other Garda investigations were also initiated relating to Donegal, one conducted by Assistant Commissioner Murphy in response to <Col N="1301" /> allegations made by two Members of this House, the other by a chief superintendent to investigate a related matter raised by a member of the Garda Síochána in Donegal concerning the original investigation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Garda investigations there are a number of civil actions taken against the State relating to Donegal. Complaints have been made to the Garda Complaints Board and the Commissioner will have to consider the question of possible disciplinary action against certain members of the force. The position is, therefore, extremely complicated. I have said in this House that it is a matter of great concern that individual members of the Garda Síochána might be implicated in wrong-doing. I am strongly of the view that it is essential for the reputation of the force that any alleged wrong-doing by members are investigated thoroughly and, if well-founded, appropriate disciplinary or criminal proceedings should be initiated.</P>
    <P>I want to see the truth of this matter determined. I also want to see public confidence in the Garda, in so far as it has been adversely affected by the matter, restored. The question is how do we best achieve this in practice. I can understand the concerns expressed inside and outside this House that the position is still unresolved. Deputies will be aware that I sought the advice of the Attorney General as to what options are open to me to carry out an appropriate examination, be it a sworn inquiry or otherwise. The Attorney General's advice, in particular, pointed out the very serious difficulties that would arise while civil and criminal proceedings are still pending and advised that these proceedings should be allowed to run their course. No Minister acting responsibly can afford to ignore the advice of the Attorney General on a matter of this kind and I do not intend to do so either. Nevertheless, I acknowledge the widespread public concern about this matter and I believe that it is not satisfactory for me at this stage to simply say that nothing at all can be done to allay public concern.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>Taking into account the difficulties identified by the Attorney General on the one hand and the need to address current public concerns on the other, I have decided to ask an eminent legal person to examine all the relevant papers and the progress on these investigations generally with a view to my receiving expert independent advice as to whether there are measures that might now be taken to bring matters to finality sooner rather than later. I will make Deputies aware of the advice I receive in this regard. I appreciate that, in taking this action prior to the completion of civil and criminal proceedings, I am doing something which, to the best of my knowledge, is without precedent, but I believe also that the circumstances of the case are unusual and that this House and the public need an authoritative independent assurance that everything possible is <Col N="1302" /> being done to close the matter. I believe the action I am proposing will achieve this without running the risk of jeopardising the civil and criminal proceedings already in being, a result which would not serve the public interest in this case.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of any advice I may receive as to action that might now be taken to bring the various matters to finality, I want to make it clear again that I am not opposed to the idea of a public inquiry in this case, at the conclusion of the various court proceedings, should that be required.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it is no longer tenable that he wait for the outcome of any further Garda investigations or outstanding court proceedings to take appropriate action so the truth relating to this affair is known? Will he indicate to the House what action, if any, he proposes taking? Will he clarify for the House whether an application for an exhumation order was received by his Department on 10 June 1997, eight months after the death of Mr. Richard Barron, and why he did not approve such order before October 1997? Is he aware of the reason the application for the order was apparently put on hold by the Garda Síochána in October 1997? What inquiries has the Minister made since October 1997 in the context of the extraordinary and continuing allegations of Garda misconduct in Donegal? Did he inquire into why the original application for the exhumation order made in June 1997 was withdrawn in October 1997 from his Department?</P>

      <P>As I already outlined, I have been advised by the Attorney General that it would not be prudent for me to become involved in a public inquiry at this time in relation to the events in Donegal because criminal and civil proceedings are pending. However, I am concerned about the matter and I understand the frustration of Members about the fact that it appears the matter has been ongoing for a considerable time. Taking into account the difficulties identified by the Attorney General on the one hand and the need, on the other, to address public concern as expressed in the House, I have decided to ask an eminent legal person to examine all the relevant papers and the progress on the investigations generally with a view to me receiving independent expert advice on whether measures might now be taken to bring matters to a finality sooner rather than later.

    <P>I appreciate that in taking this action prior to the completion of civil and criminal proceedings I am doing something which, to the best of my knowledge, is without precedent.

My view is that the action I have proposed will achieve this without running the risk of jeopardising the civil and criminal proceedings already in train, a result that would not serve the public interest in this case. Irrespective of any advice I may receive on action that might now be taken to bring the matters to finality, I wish to make it clear again that I am not opposed to the idea of a public inquiry in this case at the conclusion of the various court proceedings.</P>
    <P>A request was received in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for an exhumation order. In so far as I recall, that request was received on 10 October 1997 and not 10 June. As I said, the papers were under preparation in the Department when, on 16 October 1997, the same Garda officer who made the request to the coroner telephoned and stated that he wanted to put the matter on hold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the four persons convicted of the unlawful killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, three have been granted a single period of temporary release since their committal to prison custody. These temporary releases took place in October 2000, December 2000 and earlier this month. The fourth prisoner has had three such temporary releases which took place in October 2000, January 2001 and in April 2001. Each release consisted of a period of three overnights and were granted in accordance with standard criteria that have applied in such cases. In all cases, leave was granted on compassionate grounds. Deputies will be aware that compassionate leave concessions were available to paramilitary prisoners long before the Good Friday Agreement came to be negotiated and before any ceasefires were in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, on my behalf, in the course of Private Notice Questions in the House on 13 and 14 December last, stated that I was arranging for procedures to be put in place to ensure the victim's family be informed when short-term compassionate parole was being <Col N="1307" /> granted in these cases. Such procedures have been implemented and in the most recent instance, the Garda authorities and the victim's spouse were informed in advance of the impending temporary release.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the question of any early release for these prisoners has been stated on numerous occasions by both myself and An Taoiseach. In addition, I wish to state that two of the prisoners in question have applied to the courts seeking release under the Good Friday Agreement. The Government will defend fully its position in these proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread perception that those found guilty in our courts of the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe are having a particularly easy time in one of the more luxurious prison institutions, that they are free to run their personal lives from that institution and that they are allowed time out in circumstances that do not comply with the usual compassionate grounds cited by the Minister? Will the Minister specifically indicate the compassionate grounds relating to those prisoners granted temporary release? Will he inform the House whether any information has come to his attention which indicates that the bases upon which such temporary releases were sought were fraudulent? Is the Minister aware that the widow of the late Garda Jerry McCabe, Ann McCabe, has expressed concern that she only learns of these events at the last minute and is not given any reasonable or practical notice of such releases? In light of assurances given to me in this House almost a year ago to which the Minister just referred, what action does the Minister propose to take to tackle this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The details sought by Deputy Shatter on the temporary releases are as follows: Prisoner Kevin Walsh was granted three overnights to visit his sick father in November of this year; Pearse McAuley was granted three overnights to visit his sick father in October 2000 and January 2001 and three overnights in April 2001 to attend his father's funeral; Michael O'Neill was granted three overnights in October 2000 to visit his sick mother; and Jeremiah Sheehy was granted three overnights in December 2000 to visit his sick mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject the notion that the area in which these prisoners are being detained could be described as some kind of holiday camp. The part of Castlerea Prison in which they are detained comprises five detached houses, three two-storeys and two bungalows. The accommodation is quite basic and the area is surrounded by perimeter walls, covered by CCTV and supervised at all times by prison staff. In view of developments in the peace process, it is not inappropriate that these prisoners should not be detained in a maximum security setting. The selection process for transfer of prisoners to the compound takes <Col N="1308" /> particular account of their security requirements. It is important to note that 19 non-subversive prisoners are also located in the area of the prison in question, all of whom have access to the same type of facilities available in some of the other low security prisons.</P>
    <P>The regime in this part of Castlerea Prison is similar to that which operates in some of the other low security institutions. Some of the descriptions of the accommodation give a misleading impression of luxury and tend to ignore the reality that inmates in the prison, like those elsewhere in the prison system, are behind prison walls in secure custody. Contrary to reports, these prisoners are not in a position to take some of the liberties referred to. A high level of trust is placed in each prisoner to conform to the rules of the unit in the absence of close supervision. While the regime is not very strict, there are rules and regulations which must be adhered to. When a person is locked up without the liberty to move about, that person is imprisoned.</P>

In this regard, the National Roads Authority has commissioned an evaluation of the effectiveness of the pilot programme and a speed camera technology scoping study, to determine the most effective strategy for the use of speed cameras, from a group of consultants with experience of such systems in Australia and South Africa.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that following receipt of the results of these studies, which are due shortly, the Garda Síochána, in consultation with the high level group on road safety, will be in a position to make a policy decision on the future strategy in relation to Garda use of speed camera technology.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have sought and obtained my Department's sanction to purchase mobile speed detection equipment such as GATSO &ndash; a mobile unit with on board camera, radar and computer facilities, in-car video systems, motor cycle mounted cameras, tripod mounted laser speed detection devices and radar speed guns. My Department gives full consideration to all Garda requests for such equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the offences detected by the use of the cam<Col N="1310" /> eras referred to by the Deputy, I am further informed by the Garda authorities that 30,230 speeding offences were detected using fixed speed cameras in the Louth-Meath and north Dublin areas in 2000. To date, just over 30,000 detections have been made in those areas. The offending drivers are initially pursued by way of fixed penalty notice &ndash; on-the-spot fine &ndash; in excess of 80% of which are paid voluntarily without recourse to court proceedings.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>Furthermore, I refer the Deputy to the current Garda road safety campaign &ldquo;Operation Lifesaver&rdquo; which is focusing primarily on speeding, drink driving, seat belt offences and vulnerable road users. In relation to speeding, the number of fines on-the-spot issued nation-wide for this offence was up 214% on 1997, from 71,337 in 1997 to 224,264 in the year 2000. This year to date, more than 250,000 on-the-spot fines for speeding have been issued. I have been assured by the Garda authorities that Garda enforcement in relation to this offence will continue to remain high for the rest of this year and on into 2002.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that there is a range of measures in the national road safety strategy to address the problem of road fatalities. The problem of excessive speeding cannot be solved solely by Garda enforcement and detection, and I would remind drivers to take personal responsibility &ndash; slow down, wear a seat belt and do not drink and drive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in the context of 30,000 detections occurring as a result of only four fixed speed cameras, these cameras have a particularly important role to play in ensuring people do not drive above the speed limit? Does he agree they have an important role to play in reducing the deaths and injuries occurring on our roads? Does he agree in view of the estimate that in excess of 400 people will lose their lives on our roads this year, as tragically happened a similar number of people last year, that there is a need for a substantial number of additional cameras? Does the Minister agree that the four cameras in question are misnamed given that they are being transported by the Garda to 20 different sites throughout a large area and are not so much fixed as ever-travelling? Does he acknowledge that a sensible road safety strategy should result in the installation of a substantial number of additional cameras in fixed locations on a permanent basis to reduce speeding and save lives? Will the Minister explain why gardaí are driving around with four cameras to 20 sites when there should be 20 cameras located at these sites and at other sites throughout the country?</P>

As and when information becomes available on the pilot study, decisions will be taken on the extension of the camera technology.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will appreciate, the deployment of Garda resources and the investigative methods used in murder cases are matters for the Garda Commissioner. I have been informed by the commissioner that a number of national support units have been established, working under an assistant commissioner. These units include the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation which investigates all forms of serious crime including murder and organised crime. While responsibility for the investigation of crime rests with local garda officers, the bureau provides assistance to serious investigations through a range of expertise and skills available within it. Staff assist in preliminary inquiries, case management, incident room management, general investigation, file preparation and other ancillary aspects of criminal investigation. Specialist investigation teams within the bureau carry out these tasks when requested by local gardaí or on the direction of senior Garda management. The system is designed to meet modern policing requirements in an efficient and professional manner, both at home and internationally. Personnel and expertise from former units have been incorporated into the national support units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous Garda investigations. The identification of a motive, such as an association with organised crime, and the evidence available in its support are key elements of the investigation and prosecution processes. Organised crime is undoubtedly one factor in the murder rate. The Garda Commissioner has <Col N="1312" /> informed me that the necessary resources have been directed towards such areas of criminal activity and that a continued proactive and integrated approach is taken by the Garda to the investigation of cases where the involvement of organised criminals is suspected. I have been assured that no effort will be spared to solve such crimes and bring to justice those involved.</P>
    <P>Almost all murders recorded to date this year have been detected and such a high detection rate indicates that the strategy being pursued by the Garda, which I have outlined, is effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>With regret, I have to disagree with the Minister's reply. There is a high level of unease, worry and concern in the community regarding the number of people who have gone missing. That the bodies of more than eight women and a number of men who have gone missing have not been recovered is a cause for serious concern. In view of public concern, will the Minister discuss with the Garda Commissioner the policies he believes should be undertaken regarding the re-establishment of the murder squad? I ask the Minister to ensure that a specialised, top level unit is available for the immediate investigation of murder or missing persons cases. While I am pleased that progress has been made by the discovery of the body of a German journalist near Drogheda, there is great concern about other people who have gone missing. I ask the Minister to look into this matter as a priority, to relieve some of the concern and to help solve crimes.</P>

      <P>The situation regarding missing persons is that Operation Trace was set up by the Garda Síochána to see if there were similarities in relation to the disappearances of certain women and to see if a pattern could be established. No evidence has been produced, however, to suggest that a serial killer was involved in the disappearances of the women.</P>
      <P>In relation to the murder squad, I have said that a unit of the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation can be called on by local gardaí. Alternatively, the unit can be sent to a given area on the instructions of Garda management. I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner on a number of occasions in relation to the unit and he strongly believes that it is the most effective way to tackle crimes such as murder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been disappointment that the Minister and the commissioner have apparently scaled down Operation Trace. Rather than scaling it down, I ask that new people with fresh ideas be brought to the operation. Such a move is essential. The Minister said there is no evidence of a serial killer, but the many similarities in the cases of missing women merit further investigation. While I agree that the National <Col N="1313" /> Bureau of Criminal Investigation is progressive, I call once more for the re-establishment of the Garda murder squad, which had many successes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with Deputy Enright's queries regarding the murder squad. Operation Trace was established by the Garda Commissioner in 1998 and is headed by an Assistant Garda Commissioner. It has devoted a considerable amount of time to the re-examination of the cases of a number of missing persons. Garda authorities have informed me that no discernible pattern emerged to support the theory that a serial killer is responsible for some disappearances. The manner in which the women disappeared creates particular difficulties for investigating gardaí. Criminal profiling and analysis based on crime scene examination are not possible if there is no crime scene. Pathological evidence is not available if a body has not been found. I understand that victim profiling has not established a link between the cases.</P>
      <P>It is important that it be understood that while the theory cannot be discounted, no evidence has emerged to suggest that a serial killer is at work. It goes without saying that any new lead will be vigorously investigated by the Garda. I am not aware of any scaling down of Operation Trace. The Garda Síochána is anxious to trace all missing persons.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>if he is considering proposals for the introduction of an identity card for all non-nationals from outside the European Economic Area who are legally resident here; the way in which the proposed card system will work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It has long been the case that, subject to limited exceptions, every non-European Economic Area national present in the State for more than three months is required to register with the Garda Síochána in accordance with Article 11 of the Aliens Order, 1946. On registration, non-nationals are given a Garda registration certificate which includes biographical details, a photograph and passport details. There are two versions of the registration certificate. The older version is commonly referred to as the green book and the second version is a new high security electronically generated card, containing similar details. It is intended that the new card will gradually replace the green book and that within the next 12 months the majority of green books will have been replaced with elec<Col N="1314" /> tronically generated cards. The security features embodied in the new card make it extremely difficult for criminals to abuse the cards through counterfeit or forgery.</P>
      <P>The new card is a product of the Garda National Immigration Bureau's new computerised information system, launched on 21 September 2001. It reflects a gradual transformation from an entirely paper based registration system to a computerised system. It is planned that the computerised system will be gradually rolled out from the immigration registration office to registration offices throughout the country. The new system facilitates faster throughput of non-national customers and its full effects will be felt when persons who are registered under the new system come to re-register for a second time. Their existing details can be easily accessed and a new card can be issued very quickly in most cases.</P>
      <P>The card is a particularly prescient development in the light of the terrorist atrocities in the United States on 11 September. In the immediate aftermath of those incidents, extraordinary meetings of the European Justice and Home Affairs Council took place, at which an extensive and wide-ranging programme of tasks was agreed. In addition, UN Security Council Resolution 1373/2001 of 28 September 2001 imposed significant additional obligations on all UN member states. The obligations require EU and UN states to exercise the utmost vigilance when issuing residence permits and to take measures to prevent counterfeiting, forgery or the fraudulent use of identity documents. One of the main benefits of the new electronic card is that it is far less amenable to such activities than the green book.</P>
      <P>Asylum applicants are not obliged to register with the Garda Síochána in the aforementioned manner. Instead, they are issued with a temporary residence certificate by the refugee applications commissioner, in accordance with the provisions of the section 9 of the Refugee Act, 1996, which was commenced in full by me in November last year.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional information</i>The temporary residence certificate is evidence of the person's entitlement to remain in the State pending a determination of his or her claim for asylum. A person issued with such a certificate is deemed to have complied with the registration requirement contained in the 1946 order. The certificate is an electronically generated card which contains certain biographical details and a photograph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies should be aware that establishing identity is not an easy process. A birth certificate provides evidence of birth, but does not confirm that the person is still alive or that the individual producing the certificate is the person named on it. In the case of the temporary residence certificate card, it is often the case that there is little evidence available to an asylum applicant to substantiate assertions made as to his or her true <Col N="1315" /> identity. Similarly, it can arise in a small number of cases that those who present to the Garda registration officer are unable through no fault of their own to produce a passport or other documentation to establish satisfactorily their identity. This might arise in the case of a successful applicant for refugee status or in the case of a person who is given leave to remain in the State for humanitarian reasons. A balance has to be struck between the cost, practicability and inconvenience of checks and the consequent reliability of the card. This problem is faced by immigration authorities in all jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The aforementioned cards may be distinguished from national identity cards, issued to citizens in a number of European countries and which may be used in lieu of a passport for travel within the European Union. The issuance of such cards to citizens in those countries is subject to a similar level of checks on identity as a passport. The temporary residence certificate card and, to a much lesser extent, the Garda registration certificate card are not always issued on the basis of definitive independent information as to the person's identity. Consequently, while they constitute evidence that the persons named have complied with the requirements of immigration law generally, they are not intended to be used as cards which certify or guarantee the identity of the holder.</P>

      <P>What categories of non-nationals would be required to hold such a card? Media reports indicate that it is intended to require such a card for other groups and not just asylum seekers. Is that true? Are only adults required to have a card or must non-nationals who are under age also have one? The Minister indicated that non-nationals would not be required to carry the card in all circumstances. Can he clarify when they would be required to have such a card in their possession?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Article 15 of the Aliens Order, 1946 every non-national is required to produce on demand, unless he gives a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances which prevent him from so doing, evidence that he is registered or deemed to be registered, has a Garda registration certificate or temporary residence certificate or a valid passport or some other document satisfactorily establishing his nationality and identity. A failure to comply with this provision constitutes an offence under section 6 of the Aliens Act, 1945.</P>
      <P>Any person who, for example, in the future applies for asylum in the State would be obliged to have one of these cards which would be issued to the individual by the relevant authorities. In addition, any person who intends to stay within the State for a period of three months, or more, is obliged to have such a card. The card is renewable on expiration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this matter is by now well known. However, for ease of reference I will again set out the facts. A newspaper article &ndash; published on Sunday 11 February <Col N="1317" /> 2001 &ndash; alleged that members of the Garda Síochána and a civilian employee at Garda headquarters had participated in trips abroad paid for by a company which supplies tyres to the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>On 13 February 2001, I advised the House that the Garda Commissioner had asked a chief superintendent to look at the allegations. I also advised the House that I was of the view that the matter warranted an external examination and that the Secretary General of my Department, in his capacity as accounting officer for the Garda Vote, had instructed the internal audit unit of the Department to examine the matter.</P>
      <P>The matter subsequently became the subject of a criminal investigation and I was informed by the Garda authorities that the chief superintendent appointed by the Garda Commissioner submitted an investigation file to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 20 April 2001 on the matters alleged. I was also informed that on 3 August 2001 the DPP sought additional information and that a further file was submitted on 13 September 2001. The directions of the DPP are currently awaited.</P>
      <P>The investigation being carried out by the internal audit unit in the Department is continuing. They have raised certain queries &ndash; that may be of a criminal nature &ndash; with the Garda authorities which relate to the ongoing criminal investigation. These queries are now the subject of a criminal investigation and, in respect of which, a file will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions in due course.</P>
      <P>I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that to date no charges have been brought against any member of the Garda Síochána or against any other persons in connection with this matter. No one is currently suspended &ndash; although I am informed by the Garda authorities that one member was suspended for a day while being interviewed as part of the investigation.</P>
      <P>I understand the Comptroller and Auditor General is carrying out a value for money examination of the purchasing of tyres by the Garda Síochána and this is expected to be finalised soon. When I have received the report, I intend to lay copies before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

Will the Minister acknowledge that when difficulties occur within the Garda force that give rise to public disquiet, it takes far too long before investigations undertaken are concluded and before there is transparency and accountability to this House and to the general public?

      <P>The Secretary General's investigation is continuing, that is the investigation by the internal audit unit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Certain queries that may be of a criminal nature have been raised with Garda authorities. These queries are now the subject of a criminal investigation and a file in respect of these will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions in due course. When the Garda response to these queries has been received the internal audit unit expects to be in a position to finalise its report on the matter.</P>
      <P>This report will be furnished to me and to the Secretary General of my Department in his capacity as the accounting officer. I will keep the House fully informed on the outcome of the internal audit report. However, unlike the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the internal audit report is likely to focus on potentially criminal behaviour. The House will appreciate that care must be taken to respect the rights of individuals and must ensure that nothing is done that might prejudice potential criminal or civil proceedings. It may not be possible, therefore, to publish the report of the internal audit unit in full.</P>
      <P>On the issue of delays, Deputy Shatter will be more aware than most that there are times when criminal investigations can take a protracted period of time. There is very little I can do about this. I have no control over the length of the period of investigation. I can only try to ensure that reports are made available to Members as quickly as possible.

Garda authorities are in the process of drawing together the relevant sections in the code and regulations into one single set of guidelines which will incorporate best practice world wide in this area and will also be thorough, comprehensive and transparent.</P>

    <P>Under the ethics in public office prescribed public body designated directorships and designated positions in public bodies regulations of 1997 the Garda commissioners, deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners and the chief superintendents as well as those superintendents in the areas of supplies and equipment, finance, transport and housing are prescribed as persons <Col N="1319" /> who occupy designated positions in a public body under the Act. Section 18 imposes the requirement to make returns on interests which could materially influence the person in, or in relation to, the performance of the functions of the position.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the Secretary General in his Department raised queries with the Garda Síochána in this matter and the replies are awaited. When were the queries raised by the Secretary General and how long have they been awaited? Are those members of the Garda Síochána whose behaviour is considered to be under investigation co-operating with the Secretary General in providing answers to questions raised and are they co-operating with any internal Garda investigation taking place? When does he expect the investigation and that of his Secretary General will conclude?

      <P>The investigation is being carried out by the internal audit unit in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and it will report to the Secretary General in due course. I cannot give timescales to Deputy Shatter. Everything that could be done has been done to bring finality to this very serious matter. There may well be criminal charges arising out of these investigations. I cannot say when the investigations will be completed. I have no reason to believe that people are not co-operating with the investigations. I will put the Comptroller and Auditor General's report before the House as soon as I receive it. It has been completed. I hope the other report will be completed at a very early date, but to put a timescale on it would be to give hostage to fortune and I am not prepared to do that.</P>

      <QRef>[27668/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the comments of the Equality Authority on the case of Donovan v Donnellan on which the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations issued a preliminary decision on 17 October 2001. The background to the case is that on 8 August 2000 four horses were wandering on the public road in Gort, County Galway. The Garda investigated this incident and prosecuted Mr. Donovan, who is a member of the Traveller <Col N="1320" /> community, because he owned at least one of the horses. Mr. Donovan made a complaint to the Director of Equality Investigations claiming the Garda discriminated against him. While he accepted he was guilty of the offence, he claimed that he did not own all the horses and that the Garda did not summon the other horse owners who were not Travellers.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what is stated in the Deputy's question, the equality officer did not find that the Garda is exempt from the Equal Status Act, 2000, nor did the Equality Authority in its comments make such a claim. The equality officer decided that the investigation and prosecution of crime are not services within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Act and therefore the complaint was outside the scope of the Act. However, the equality officer was of the view that: &ldquo;Clearly certain aspects of the service provided by the gardaí may be services within the meaning defined in the Act, e.g. a garda witnessing a passport application, giving directions or taking a complaint.&rdquo;  The decision of the equality officer is not surprising and indeed is consistent with the intention of the Oireachtas in passing the Bill.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the statement I made during the Dáil debate on this legislation on 15 December 1999 which clearly illustrates the point that the Oireachtas intended the service aspects of policing to be covered by the Act but the investigation and prosecution of crime to be excluded from its scope:</P>
      <P>Not all actions of the State<i> vis-à-vis</i> members of the public can be regarded as services. There is a difference between controlling duties exercised by the State and services provided by the State. I am advised that immigration and citizenship matters, for example, are not services within the meaning of the Equal Status Bill but rather an expression of the State's duty as a sovereign power to control who it admits to the State. Controlling duties in the areas of policing, defence and prisons would likewise not be regarded as services. The service aspect of policing, immigration, defence and prisons will, however, come within the scope of the Bill. For example, while a decision to grant a visa would not be covered by the Equal Status Bill, the interaction between officials and the visa applicant and collateral services and facilities, such as access to buildings and information, would come within the scope of the legislation.</P>
      <P>In the policing area, for example, while riot control or apprehending a criminal gang could not be regarded as services, information and assistance provided by gardaí, including responding to reported crimes, would be regarded as services, within the scope of the equal status legislation. Furthermore, the fact that a controlling duty of the State does not come within the scope of the legislation does not give <i>carte blanche</i> to officials to discriminate in the exercise of such duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" />
      <i>Additional information.</i>Discrimination or irrationality in the exercise of such controlling duties can be challenged in a High Court constitutional action or in judicial review proceedings. In commenting on the equality investigation in question the equality officer expressed the view that the drafting of the legislation succeeded in excluding from the scope of the Act the controlling duties of the Garda Síochána, including those of the investigation and prosecution of crime, while at the same time legislating that the service aspects of policing come within its scope.</P>
    <P>It is a major concern of mine that the Garda Síochána, in the exercise of its core functions, should be totally impartial. The Garda Síochána has taken several initiatives in this respect. In addition to the establishment of the Garda racial and intercultural office, the Garda Síochána has also agreed guiding principles for dealing with interculturalism, including the commitment to treat everyone fairly, regardless of ethnic origin, religious belief, gender, sexual orientation, disability or social background. As part of the Council of Europe human rights and policing initiative, the Garda has established a working group to develop policy and practice on human rights and policing issues. A module regarding obligations under international human rights instruments is a core part of the training of new recruits to the Garda Síochána in Templemore. Traveller representatives take part in Garda training. A Garda project entitled Intercultural Ireland &ndash; Mainstreaming the Challenges has been approved for funding under the EU Community Action Programme to combat discrimination.</P>
    <P>The Equality Authority has gone on record to highlight the welcome and serious proactive approach to rights issues taken by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to look at the legislation again with a view to addressing the issue raised by the Equality Authority? Is he concerned that the director of the Equality Authority raised concerns about this matter? There appears to have been discrimination on grounds of membership of the Traveller community in this case.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at the time of the debate on the Equal Status Bill the national consultative committee on racism and interculturalism expressed concern at the exemption of public authorities and public bodies from certain sections of the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have doubts about extending the Equal Status Act to cover the controlling functions of the State. If this argument were accepted, actions taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Judiciary would also be covered. It would be contrary to the independence of the Judiciary and the Director of Public Prosecutions if an equality officer were to have <Col N="1322" /> powers to review decisions on arrest, prosecution and conviction.</P>
      <P>As I said in the Dáil during the course of the debate, it is open to an aggrieved person who claims to have been discriminated against by the Garda or any other organ of the State to challenge in a High Court constitutional action or in judicial review proceedings. I will, of course, keep under review the need for legislation in this area. However, extending the scope of the Equal Status Act may not be the best method of proceeding in any event.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's second question, I indicated in the course of the Oireachtas debates on the Bill that there is no doubt but that the equal status legislation applies to the State. I was advised that following the landmark Supreme Court judgment in Howard v the Commissioners of Public Works in 1993 it is neither necessary nor desirable to state in legislation that the State is bound thereby. In Ireland the doctrine of crown prerogative whereby the State is not bound by any statute which does not include it expressly or by implication did not survive the enactment of the Constitution in 1937. The uncertainty that had surrounded this issue was finally laid to rest in the landmark Supreme Court judgment in which it was held that the State was bound by the Planning Acts and was in consequence obliged to apply for planning permission before building an interpretative centre.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I was advised that it was unnecessary to state explicitly in the equal status legislation that the State is bound thereby. Indeed, it would have been undesirable to do so, in the same way as it is undesirable to purport to implement the EU Council regulation by way of domestic law.  </P>

I especially acknowledge and remember the families of the 46 personnel who lost their lives during that period.</P>
      <P>Yesterday's tragic aeroplane crash in New York was a cruel coincidence for a city that has suffered enough already. It will have adverse consequences for the aviation industry world-wide. In that context will the Taoiseach report progress to the House on the state of Aer Lingus, the rescue package and if the Government is still pressing the case in Brussels for an investment of equity in the company?</P>

      <P>I join the leader of the Fine Gael Party in saluting our Defence Forces and their contribution in the Lebanon. We are mindful not only of those who died but also of the one person who is still missing. By way of supplementary question to Deputy Noonan's, will the Taoiseach indicate if, in view of the additional burden this second dreadful event in New York will have on the aviation industry, it is time for a developed domestic tourism policy to be promulgated by the Government to offset what will be a disinclination by many people to travel by air?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate and thank all our soldiers who have served not only in the recent past but over the past 23 years in Camp Shamrock and Tibnin. The Minister for Defence has already done so. They provided a huge service, not only to this country but to the flag of the United Nations. I also thank their families for allowing them to make that contribution. I also remember the 46 members of the Defence Forces who tragically lost their lives during those years. Some years ago I had the opportunity to visit Tibnin and acknowledge the enormous work undertaken by the soldiers, not only in the service of the United Nations but also on humanitarian issues, in the orphanage and other child welfare issues. They brought great service to the country and built up a special relationship with the local population.</P>
      <P>I also join Deputies Noonan and Howlin in, once again, extending my sympathies to the United States, to Mayor Giuliani and the citizens of New York. One accident is bad enough but on top of the atrocities of 11 September it is appalling for those affected. The tragedy will not help the aviation industry. It has already affected share prices and has been a shock to aviation companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other airlines, Aer Lingus is going through a difficult period. Our concern is to help it. All negotiation lines remain open and we must continue to work to try to ensure the company can be sustained through this difficult period.

      <P>The company needs assistance and we must work out the best way to provide it. We have made our case in the European context and will continue to do so. We must also deal with other matters. The Labour Relations Commission is now actively involved with Aer Lingus management and unions, assisting in the creation of an agreed process and timetable for discussions on the survival plan. We must monitor these discussions and will continue to look at equity aspects. However, nobody wants us to provide equity at any cost which might damage the company's sustainability.</P>
      <P>Some of those involved in the aviation business are offering equity for the purpose of asset stripping companies to their base requirements. If that was to happen to Aer Lingus the result would be much worse for the company in terms of the survival plan the Government is seeking to achieve. We must continue to try to assist the company, the unions and the management through what is a very difficult period while continuing to make the case for the obvious need for equity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the dispute between the sugar beet growers and the Irish Sugar Company plc. I am anxious that the matter is resolved quickly to the satisfaction of both sides.</P>
      <P>It is important to explain that the production of sugar in all European Union member states is regulated by the EU sugar regime. The EU regulation specifies a minimum price for sugar beet. In some member states, including Ireland, an additional payment termed the deficit premium payment is paid. Under the regulation sugar manufacturers are obliged to pay at least the minimum and, where appropriate, the deficit premium for sugar beet. Any additional amount is a matter for negotiation between the two parties. The information available to me indicates that Irish Sugar plc. pays above the minimum price specified in the EU regulation.</P>
      <P>As the sugar manufacturing season is now well under way and many farmers are ready to deliver their crop, I am very concerned that the matter is resolved quickly and I urge both sides to come together and do everything possible to find a solution acceptable to all concerned, not least the 650 employees, many of whom are seasonal workers and depend on this money for Christmas. I am concerned at recent developments and lack of apparent progress in the dispute up to now. I am very conscious that the sugar beet harvesting season is of short duration and time is of the essence. This dispute, no matter what its origins, cannot be allowed to drag on indefinitely.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for the food industry, I am concerned about the deterioration in relations between the growers and Irish Sugar plc. and again urge both parties to work out a solution as a matter of urgency. Should this not happen within a very short timeframe, although neither side has formally asked for my direct involvement, I shall use my good offices to seek to bring about a speedy resolution of the matter at least for the current crop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to what the Minister of State said, it is obvious the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development had no contact with either side despite the ongoing dispute for the past eight to ten months. I am absolutely amazed at the Minister of State's reply on the matter. Has he contacted the IFA or Greencore on the matter? What contact has he had with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment given that 650 jobs are at stake and that together with the knock-on effect on other <Col N="1333" /> service industries we could be talking about at least 1,000 jobs? Is the Minister of State telling the House that he has had no contact with the parties involved despite the fact that it has been on the cards for the past eight to ten months that the dispute would reach a climax?</P>
      <P>Surely the farming community will not be allowed to again suffer a major catastrophe in regard to income for themselves and their families? Is it possible that nothing has been done in this regard despite the figures quoted repeatedly in the lead-up to the dispute, culminating in both factories being closed? Is the Minister of State aware of the problems in extracting the crop because of the closure of both factories &ndash; it will take at least a week if not more to recommence processing? I was an employee of the Carlow sugar factory and I am fully aware of the problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been talking to beet growers in recent days and the reality is that this is a commercial transaction between the IFA and Irish Sugar plc. While it is not a commercial transaction in the true sense &ndash; there is a monopoly &ndash; it has always been standard practice. Negotiations on both sides have been going on for ten months and nothing has been achieved. The position escalated over the weekend when the Irish Sugar Company took out a court injunction which embittered the other side and caused a lot of anger. While we were not asked to intervene by the other side which looked yesterday for an independent chairperson, at least noises were made in that direction. My Department is prepared to meet two of the parties together at any time. I suggest that a two on two meeting would be the best solution, whether it is chaired by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or an independent person. In recent hours we have encouraged both parties to meet.</P>

I am sure he will confirm that the State holds what is still known as the &ldquo;golden share&rdquo; in the Irish sugar industry. This issue was debated at some length some years ago when Greencore was being set up. I am sure the Minister of State will agree this places an onus on him and his Department to ensure the future of the Irish sugar industry. Is he saying that since the dispute began many months ago from a nego<Col N="1334" /> tiations point of view, but last week from a protest point of view, his Department has not been proactive? Will he wait for the 25th hour to intervene? I am sure he is aware that since last Wednesday there have been protests at both factories on a 24 hour basis. There is a sense of anger and despair among those who supply produce to the factories and there is great anxiety among workers. The farmers and workers would be stunned to read&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of Deputy Bradford's question, there have been discussions between senior officials of the Department and various people on both sides. There has been informal contact by telephone but neither side has asked the Department to intervene in this commercial dispute over the price of beet. There is 199,000 tonnes of beet involved and we are aware of the risk of damage to harvested beet in the event of frost and the danger to road traffic, where there are large quantities of beet on the roadside. We are anxious to have the dispute settled and will give any possible help towards achieving that. However, it is essentially a commercial dispute between two parties which have been in ongoing discussions for more than ten months and have not sought anybody's intervention during that period. The sugar beet crop is a very valuable asset to this country and we are anxious that it be maintained, in the interests of both sides in the dispute. I believe there is room for manoeuvre on each side and the matter can be settled reasonably easily if both sides are willing to meet.</P>

Will he reconsider that, as a courtesy to the House, in view of the fact that at least one member of his party has informed a number of the farmers concerned that, at their behest, he had spoken to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, and that the Minister said he would do nothing? Will the <Col N="1335" /> Minister of State reformulate his reply, in the light of that, because I know he would not wish to mislead the House? Will he agree that the Minister has been asked, formally, to take a position on this? In view of the fact that this is a regulated sector and that, under the current market regulation, there is a national quota, will the Minister of State agree that, as part of the authority which set up that quota, he and his Department have a responsibility to ensure production takes place? Does he agree that, in addition to the downside of the regulation, whereby his Department applies penalties, he should also look after the upside of the regulation, in terms of his responsibility to ensure production takes place as per the market organisation?</P>

      <P>It is an essential requirement that both sides are willing to come together under some umbrella. We do not care what umbrella is used, as long as they are willing to come together. That is the main sticking point at present &ndash; are they prepared to come together? Informal telephone calls have been made to both sides. Unfortunately, the decision by the Irish Sugar Company to take a court injunction yesterday has hardened attitudes on the other side, as has the company's action in making telephone calls to farmers, asking them to supply beet to the factory. It seems to be a bitter dispute on both sides and relationships seem to have deteriorated. We are anxious that they get together under one umbrella. Everybody should use their influence with both sides in that regard to encourage the commencement of talks to settle this dispute, without further delay, in the interests of saving the beet crop and in the interests of the workers at the factories.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that more than 100 farmers are standing, in desperation, outside the Carlow sugar factory, including some from as far away as my area? They do not want to be there. They want a meeting, which they are unable to get. Is it clear to the Department that that is the case? Does the Minister of State accept that, for a meeting to take place, it needs to be meaningful and to address the salient points? I am informed that the price has remained unchanged for four years, despite increasing overheads. With improved technology, there is a greater rate of sugar extraction from the beet and farmers are asking for a share of that benefit. Is the Minister prepared to meet both sides, unilaterally in the first instance, so that there can be an agreement on the agenda and, thereby, bring about a meeting? The Minister is in a unique position to do that. Others are simply asking him to act, because he is ultimately responsible.</P>

      <P>Many beet growers, from my area and other parts of the country, have contacted me during the weekend and I know they are anxious to save their crops which, as a cash crop, is particularly important at this time of year when bank repayments are due. The company complains that French and British farmers are paid less than Irish farmers. However, rather than concerning ourselves with the details at this stage, the immediate requirement is to get the two sides together to talk about the issue. From the comments I have heard from both sides, in the media and otherwise, there is a willingness to come together but the difficulty is to get the first move in that direction.</P>

Why has he, or the Minister, not made a move to arrange a meeting to facilitate negotiations? That is his duty. In his reply, the Minister of State said this is a commercial dispute. He is in charge of the Office of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, a key industry in this country. Do I understand correctly from his reply that neither he nor the Minister had any discussions with the Irish Sugar Company or with the IFA to resolve this dispute? If he has not made any such efforts, but has left the matter in the hands of senior officials in the Department, has he not been complacent? Has he not shown a lack of urgency and has he not failed in his duty to the farmers, the workers and the Irish people by failing to initiate negotiations? This is a serious matter&mdash;</P>

      <P>weekend from farmers, hauliers who have to let workers go and contractors who have a considerable amount of money tied up in machinery. It is very important that the Minister finds a formula. I accept there is a commercial decision, but there are also many people involved and if it is not possible for the Minister to get involved himself, he should nominate a third party to bring the two groups together. The sugar company has much to learn. A court injunction in the middle of a dispute solves nothing. Dialogue is the only way forward.

We have all made appeals in the media and at public meetings for them to meet and talk. Talk across the table is the only way to settle this. I have not ever taken sides in this dispute. If the Minister offers a name and both sides accept that person, they can discuss the problem. If they do not accept that offer, we will then know who is really causing the problem.

      <P>I share the concern of all the other Deputies about the Minister being aware of the problem but not taking action. As a matter of urgency, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should immediately set up contact between Greencore, the IFA and the Beet Growers Association. I am sure negotiations are not high on the agenda of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, but in my first submission, I asked the Minister if the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was contacted in relation to this. Some 1,000 jobs are under threat because of this dispute and that is the responsibility of the Tánaiste. She should have contacted the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or vice versa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we approach Christmas it is not acceptable for 1,000 people not to know where they stand. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment must be involved. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is responsible for agriculture and is responsible for bringing these people together. It is up to the Minister of State and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Joe Walsh, to ensure this happens. Has there been any contact with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to address <Col N="1339" /> the problem affecting Carlow and its surrounding areas as well as Mallow?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister in saying that both sides have become increasingly bitter over the past 24 hours in particular. However, there is an appetite on both sides to put a structure in place that will decide on a fair price for sugar beet each year. Surely the Minister will agree with me in saying that it is his responsibility to ensure that process happens as quickly as possible. It was his responsibility this time last week to anticipate the problems before the factories had closed. Some 650 employees&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is not the most suitable person to mediate between a food company and farmers, then who is? Does he agree that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has a responsibility because it and not Greencore looks after the State's beet <Col N="1340" /> quota? Does the Minister agree that it is not a matter of a private company dealing with private producers because the quota, which is at the centre of this dispute, is controlled by the Government on behalf of the people? So it is an issue for the Department and the Minister. He is the person most qualified to mediate between farmers and a food company as the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. It is about time some leadership and initiative was shown. Both sides want to see a mediator in place quickly and it is about time names were put on the table. I respectfully say that the Minister himself should be there.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that he should suggest a name, preferably himself, and allow the sugar company and the farmers to reject that if they would? I believe neither side would reject that offer. I repeat Deputy Enright's question &ndash; could we have an assurance now that the Minister of State will offer himself as a mediator between farmers and Greencore this evening?</P>

We must realise that we cannot pre-empt what people will decide when they enter negotiations. Not everyone is intransigent but some people are. Some people on the board are anxious to have it settled as are some people from the IFA and the beet growers, but sometimes people find it hard to move once the lines are drawn.</P>
      <P>It was not a matter on which the Minister ought to have intervened last week because it is a commercial arrangement between growers, producers and processors. I accept what the Deputy said about the desire for an automatic mechanism involving an independent body to recommend an increase which both sides would accept.

For the Minister of State or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to say they have no interest because it is a commercial body is not acceptable. There are 650 jobs involved. Is this or is it not an important industry? Should the Minister of State have stood idly by until an injunction <Col N="1341" /> was issued?

      <P>I took bad advice from the Minister for Public Enterprise and bought shares in Eircom.</P>
      <P>The Minister makes the point that this is a commercial dispute. There are many commercial disputes involving private companies, some of which are based abroad, but the Tánaiste and other Ministers fly to the head offices in America to meet the senior management to prevent a firm closing and that has happened under different Ministers. Why, when we are dealing with a public quoted Irish company, could the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development not telephone the IFA and Greencore management and arrange negotiations? Common sense and logic demand that the Minister should do so. I ask the Minister to take the initiative and make those telephone calls. I call on him to state in the House that he will call both sides, and the union representatives, to a meeting at 8.30 a.m. tomorrow morning at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Because of the high standing of the Department, I believe both parties would attend. It could help to break the deadlock and bring about a resolution.</P>

Does he accept that they have suffered in such circumstances before? It seems they are on the back foot again. Accordingly, does the Minister of State accept the Department &ndash; which set out the policy on food and agriculture which has us dealing with a monopoly &ndash; has a particular responsibility to follow this through and not just look for willingness but generate, where possible, the willingness of both sides to meet?

When I contacted the Tánaiste's office to establish if she had a nominee to act as facilitator, I was told that she had no responsibility for this and that it was the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. There are a lot of Neros fiddling. Will the Minister of State come up with a name, give it to both sides and let them decide they are not going to co-operate? I have spoken to both sides.

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>
        <b>: </b>Previously, I outlined that Members on the Government side were debating this Bill as if it were a question of introducing or preventing abortion in Ireland. I have pointed out that this Bill is simply trying to patch up the botched wording that was inserted in the Constitution in 1983. Arising from the X case, that wording has led to the legalising of abortion for people who threaten to commit suicide. I do not know why we are discussing wording to be inserted into the Constitution that will in turn be challenged.</P>
      <P>Previously I mentioned that the challenge would be on whether it is conception or implantation. Members got a letter today from pro-life representatives questioning that. If this wording is inserted in the Constitution it will be challenged immediately. My forecast is &ndash; as happened in 1983 &ndash; that this will be challenged by one side, or both sides, on a couple of grounds and that more amendments will have to be brought forward later. If we had left the matter as it was in 1983 &ndash; when the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, made abortion illegal &ndash; we would not be in the mess we are in now, because abortion would be illegal. It is because we tried to copperfasten something that did not need it that we have got into these difficulties. It stems from inserting a wording in the Constitution that is not necessary. If the Government started from scratch again, we might save ourselves a great deal of bother and rows might be avoided, although this debate is more peaceful than in 1983 when the debate was savage at times. I cannot see what is to be achieved by introducing this legislation because the Minister went out of his way in his contribution to point out the question of the girl who was permitted to have an abortion by the Supreme Court because she was going to commit suicide and that a girl in a similar position would still be free to travel to England to have an abortion.</P>
      <P>Are we not playing with words? When people look back on this debate in 25 years they will say we were talking about preventing abortion while saying that women may still travel to England for an abortion. The problem is that 5,000 to 6,000 women travel to England for abortions annually and this debate will not have the slightest effect on that. People will say in 25 years that we were playing around with words and were fiddling like Nero while women travelled for abortions.</P>
      <P>We pretend we are doing something about this in the legislation. Words will be inserted in the Constitution which will be challenged in the Supreme Court. I received letters today stating that the word &ldquo;conception&rdquo; should be inserted for &ldquo;implantation&rdquo;. That is the first sign of a challenge and will result in a Supreme Court case. I do not know why the Government is bothering with this Bill. The Government gave a commitment four and a half years ago after the election so that it could stay in power.</P>

He has fulfilled his commitment, which will land us in more difficulty than was ever intended or than people deserve. I am amazed the legislation is before us because it has nothing to do with whether abortion is carried out in the State because abortion is still banned under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861. This so-called effort to provide for abortion under the Constitution will be referred immediately to the Supreme Court for interpretation and what people vote for will make no difference. If the Supreme Court judges say the word &ldquo;black&rdquo; means &ldquo;grey&rdquo;, that is it. They will interpret the legislation and I do not know what we are at.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that we have reached this stage of the human life in pregnancy Bill and that this issue has been given so much attention by a Government. It is certainly not before time, coming nine years after the difficult X case left unfinished business in relation to the protection of the unborn.</P>
      <P>Abortion has been a taboo subject for too long, with successive Governments declaring when asked that it was a complex subject. While I acknowledge that it was not an easy subject to deal with, unfortunately, not much more progress was made. I was most surprised for this reason to see the subject appear in a Fianna Fáil election manifesto with a promise to hold a referendum in the lifetime of the Government. This was one of the factors which allowed me to discuss support for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the All-Party Committee on the Constitution had a huge workload to get through following publication of the Green Paper in 1999. The committee held hearings and, in general, facilitated a full and fair public consultation process involving a wide range of groups holding an even wider range of views on this subject. Despite criticism from me regarding the time it was taking to make recommendations, I compliment the all-party committee on the work it did <Col N="1348" /> at that time, regardless of the individual opinions of committee members on the subject.</P>
    <P>I welcome this proposal which tackles head on, through a number of means, issues that have proven difficult in the past. It will enable three very important goals to be achieved, protection of the unborn, protection of current medical practice and consulting the people. Achieving balance in the attainment of these three goals is not simple and that is why the proposal to couple legislation with a referendum is the only realistic way to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>There are very real fears that if this issue remains in limbo the Supreme Court decisions somehow will become the thin end of the wedge. In general, it is felt that both judgments require a response in constitutional or legislative terms. The history of how we got to where we are today is long and difficult. I hope the lessons of the past have been learned. The fact that no laws were enacted following the passing of the 1983 referendum left the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, as the basic law in this area.</P>
    <P>Following the Supreme Court's decision in the X case in 1992 where it was found that if there was a real and substantial risk to the life as distinct to the health of the mother and if this could only be averted by a termination such a termination would be legal, we had a situation which was contrary to the intended effect of the 1983 amendment and which went against the wishes of those who voted for the pro-life amendment in 1983. Abortion, albeit in limited but hard to define circumstances, was now legal in the country that had voted nine years previously to reject it.</P>
    <P>The C case in 1997 further underpinned the risk of suicide as a reason for termination. The question of suicide, which will no doubt feature as an issue in the forthcoming referendum, whenever it takes place, deserves to be debated. While the decision of the Supreme Court in relation to suicide may have been deemed to be correct in that particular case, I do not believe that the laws for the population of a country should be made on the basis of an individual case. The simple expression, &ldquo;hard case makes bad law&rdquo;, applies to this issue.</P>
    <P>Attention was paid in the 1999 Green Paper to suicide and a submission by the pro-life campaign highlighted surveys carried out on suicide in Norway where, unlike in Ireland, comprehensive studies have been carried out. It was found that pregnant women were among the lowest risk group to commit suicide and that women who have previously had an abortion were among the high risk group.</P>
    <P>One issue that caused great disquiet following the 1983 referendum was the unclear status of the mother. Her rights to life were not clearly safeguarded and it became obvious that this could cause major ethical problems for the medical profession. Section 1 addresses for the first time the role which the medical profession plays. It states: &ldquo;Abortion does not include the carrying out of a <Col N="1349" /> medical procedure by a medical practitioner at an approved place in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self destruction.&rdquo; I support this principle 100%. The section clearly protects medical practitioners in the carrying out of necessary medical procedures on pregnant women. It cannot be considered a criminal offence to treat a pregnant woman with necessary medical practices, even if that procedure results in the death of an unborn child as a result.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that Ireland is one of the safest places in the world to have a baby, thanks to our medical professionals, and it is only right and just that their position should be safeguarded after all this time. Aside from protecting the medical profession, the section also has the effect of attempting to clarify the definition of abortion. It makes the distinction between medical practice and abortion, a matter which has been ambiguous and confusing for too long.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Health and Children introduced the Bill on 25 October he acknowledged the 6,500 women who travelled abroad to have abortions over the past 12 months. A magic wand cannot be waved to prevent this from happening. The argument that has been put forward in some quarters that it is time all of us in the pro-life campaign grew up acknowledged that many Irish women are travelling abroad to have abortions and that introduced abortion as a result is ridiculous. A number of Irish women have had abortions abroad and a number of women will travel abroad to have abortions following the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>While we can do nothing about that fact, we still have control over this jurisdiction and we should still have a say in how our country is shaped. It is up to us to decide whether it is acceptable to legalise abortion or to criminalise it regardless of what the laws are in the UK. Likewise it is up to us to decide to criminalise drug use, unlike another neighbour, Holland.</P>
    <P>The fact that so many women travel abroad must be tackled in a humane and non-judgmental way. I am sure the decision to have an abortion must be a very difficult decision to make and is not made lightly. For that reason I very much welcome the introduction of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to examine the situation and formulate a compassionate and realistic strategy to deal with crisis pregnancies. I know that this recommendation was made by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and I understand that Ms Olive Braiden has been appointed to the chair of this committee. Her appointment, coupled with funding of 6.5 million for 2002, gives me great confidence that a meaningful strategy to tackle crisis pregnancy will be formulated.</P>
    <P>Much has been made in the media of statements made from time to time by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney who has stated on a number of <Col N="1350" /> occasions that she does not want a divisive and bitter referendum. I certainly share that view and I would ask that all sides in the forthcoming referendum participate in a measured, calm debate dealing with the facts. The media have a large role to play in this regard and as a pro-life person, I hope it is not only the negative issues that are highlighted in the course of the campaign.</P>
    <P>On an issue which has been raised by Deputy Browne, certain elements of the pro-life movement have been concerned about the whole question of conception versus implantation. A number of people have written to me who are genuinely concerned about this matter. A recent article in the <i>Irish Catholic</i> newspaper attempted to address and clarify this issue. It said that there has been no attempt in the Bill to define when human life begins. The protection offered to an embryo between conception and implantation is not weakened in any way by this proposal. Article 40.3.3º prevented Ireland from signing the recent Council of Europe's convention on bio-ethics because it allowed for human embryo experimentation. As I said, the protection for the embryo between conception and implantation will not be weakened in any way by this proposal.</P>
    <P>I see this as the last chance to provide meaningful protection to the unborn. There is no other formula on offer. Adopting impossible positions will not achieve any means to forward the protection of the unborn. All it will succeed in doing is paralysing any chance of mainstreaming the pro-life issue. This proposal is a balanced and fair proposal worthy of support. It safeguards the life of the mother, medical practice and unborn children. It puts the decision-making process back into the hands of the people and it is now up to the people to decide on the future of Ireland's unborn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fox for allowing me to share her time. I welcome the proposal for a number of reasons. It deals effectively with the issue and unlike previous debates on abortion, we are starting at a point where people are reconciled to listening to the other point of view. Clearly the effect of the submissions to the Oireachtas committee has brought forward various strands of opinion and these have been effectively dealt with in the proposals. In the last general election, Fianna Fáil gave a clear commitment of support to a referendum. I am satisfied that we are now honouring those commitments.</P>
      <P>I commend the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and the Cabinet for bringing this Bill before the House. It is the result of a good deal of research, debate, thought and deliberation over recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the 25th amendment to the Constitution is to resolve the very unsatisfactory legal situation regarding abortion which has existed since the Supreme Court decision in the X case of 1992, and to resolve it in a way that gives the people of Ireland a direct say in doing so. This <Col N="1351" /> was our stated position in the 1997 general election campaign. When the Government came to office in 1997 it gave that clear commitment. I recognise the honourable role played by the Taoiseach in this fundamentally important issue. We made a promise to the people at the last election that there would be a referendum on this issue. The Taoiseach and the Government have been working towards honouring that promise since 1997.</P>
    <P>When the Government took office in 1997, the Taoiseach immediately set up a Cabinet committee to prepare the Green Paper on the subject of abortion. This committee, chaired by the Minister for Health and Children, oversaw the work of an interdepartmental group of officials who carried out the preparatory work.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents an honest attempt to finalise a debate and campaign which has dragged on for many years and it comes before the House following a careful and inclusive process of consultation and public debate. I hope that over the next few months the process of public debate, without the heat of previous debates, can continue and that the justifiable concerns of people can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I met some people in the pro-life group in the past few weeks and they clearly felt that politicians had not been dealing adequately with the issue. They are now saying that they are satisfied with the proposal. It represents a careful and inclusive process of consultation. The preparation of the Green Paper included the invitation of submissions from interested parties and organisations on the issues under consideration. When the Green Paper was published it was referred by the Government to the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution for consideration. I am very pleased the committee then embarked on a detailed process. Speaking to people who made submissions, they said that the consultative process was very helpful in examining the complex legal, medical and social issues involved. The difficulty in past referenda was that people felt the legal issues were too complex to grasp. Recognition has been given to concerns in that regard and it has been explained in layman's language.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the aforementioned deliberations has led the Government to conclude that there is no simple sentence or paragraph which can be inserted into the Constitution which by itself would amount to a balanced, effective and legal response to the complex medical and legal issues which surround the protection of human life in pregnancy. The Government sees that the proper place to strike the complex balance is in legislation, not in the Constitution. These proposals are the first legislative response to the issues raised by the 1983 amendment and by the X case.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Government has decided to put an amendment to the people which will add two new subsections, 40.3.4º and 40.3.5º to article <Col N="1352" /> 40.3 of the Constitution. Article 40.3.4º proposes that the life of the unborn in the womb will be protected in accordance with the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2001. The exact provisions of this proposed Act will be published with the wording of this proposal, thereby giving constitutional protection for the enactment by the Oireachtas of the legislation, the terms of which will be seen and approved in advance by the people. Article 40.3.5º provides that any future legislative amendment to be made to the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2001, must be approved by the people by way of referendum before it is signed into law by the President.</P>
    <P>A key element of the proposal is that the amendment will only take effect if, within 180 days, the Oireachtas enacts the Bill in exactly the same terms as the text seen and approved by the people at the referendum. This mechanism of making a constitutional amendment conditional on a later legal development was successfully used in the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement. The Minister is to be congratulated on putting this issue on a legislative basis where it belongs. The constitutional changes ensure that this legislation has a sound constitutional base coupled with the effect of giving the people reassurance that they will be consulted in the event of change being proposed in the future. During the last debate people felt that there was some back door mechanism which would mean that they would not be consulted and they feared that any glitch might lead to abortion on demand.</P>
    <P>The fact that any future legislative amendment to the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001, must be approved by the people by way of referendum ensures that those calling for complete legalisation of abortion cannot succeed without the people first being consulted about any such future proposal. Although it places the entire matter primarily in the legislative domain, the proposed amendment takes on board and acknowledges the reality that the abortion issue is near and dear to the hearts of the people and a matter on which they want to have the final decision now and in the future.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment will protect both women and the unborn in pregnancy. This is welcome and should be highlighted. In addition, it will accommodate existing medical practice which safeguards the life of the woman from exposure to real and substantial risk. The current approach will, therefore, protect the best medical practice while providing for a prohibition on abortion. I also welcome the amendment because it creates a basis for the legislative protection of human life in pregnancy. It will ensure the maximum degree of protection for unborn human life in pregnancy while, at the same time, ensuring a pregnant woman will receive necessary medical treatment to protect her life.</P>
    <P>This is achieved by the Bill excluding from the definition of abortion any medical procedure carried out by a medical practitioner at an approved <Col N="1353" /> place in the course of which or as a result of which unborn human life is ended where that procedure is, in the reasonable opinion of the practitioner, necessary to prevent a real and substantial risk of loss of the woman's life other than by self-destruction. The Bill, therefore, affords maximum protection to the unborn while, at the same time, ensuring that women in pregnancy who are suffering from certain life-threatening medical conditions receive all necessary medical treatment.</P>
    <P>The proposed law also provides that the risk of suicide will no longer be a ground for legal abortion in the State and I welcome this development. It overturns the decision of the Supreme Court in the X case, which had the potential to commence an inevitable slide towards freely available social abortion in Ireland. It must be pointed out that the suicide risk has been advanced only in cases where the State sought to restrict the freedom of a woman to travel abroad for an abortion. It should be noted that the terms of the new law do not attempt to restrict this right to travel, which was enshrined in the Constitution following the referendum in 1992.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures outlined in the Bill, the Government has decided to establish a dedicated agency, to which Deputy Fox referred, to help reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and to ensure that all arms of the State work together to help women who find themselves in such a situation. I support the proposals and I hope the issue can be debated in the coming months without the divisiveness of previous abortion referenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely hope the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is defeated in the House. The Bill is flawed and the philosophy behind it is anti-woman. If passed, it will serve only to plunge this country into yet another bitter, divisive abortion referendum, the only goal of which is to pander to the most right-wing groups in society.</P>
      <P>In the past two decades, these groups have opposed the introduction of divorce, the introduction of sex education in schools, the introduction and widespread availability of contraception, the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the constitutional referenda in 1992 on the right to information and the right to travel. They are also the groups whose fanatical pursuit of a constitutional prohibition on abortion has created the constitutional and legal mess that has pertained in this country since 1983. It appears these groups, which have been proved wrong on every question of sexual, marital or reproductive reform for more than 30 years, now have the ear of the Taoiseach. He will dance to their tune and foist an unwanted referendum on this country during the spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragedy of the Government's proposal is that it will do absolutely nothing to reduce the rate of Irish abortions. We have an abortion rate in Ireland. Today at least 18 Irish woman will tra<Col N="1354" /> vel to England to terminate a pregnancy. Figures indicate that approximately 11% &ndash; one of the highest rates in Europe &ndash; of all pregnancies in the State result in termination. Every year the number of Irish women travelling to England has steadily increased. At one of the most stressful times in their lives these women, and girls, are effectively exiled from this country. Their citizenship is temporarily suspended. They are told that official Ireland does not want to know. Officially, Ireland is a shining light of protection for the unborn. Officially, we have no abortions in this country and, officially, we will have a referendum that will even prevent women who are suicidal during a pregnancy from having an abortion here. During this time, on a daily basis, Irish women, struggling with the complexities, doubts and dangers of a pregnancy, choose to go to England for an abortion.</P>
    <P>The sole purpose of the Bill is to roll back the decision of the Supreme Court in the X case. The X case conferred a legal right to an abortion in this State for the very rare number of women who are suicidal during pregnancy. During the past decade, only two such cases have come to public attention, the X case and the C case. Both cases involved young girls who were raped by men and who were in such a state of mental and physical turmoil that they were suicidal during pregnancy. The Taoiseach now believes the whole country must vote to prevent young women such as Ms X and Ms C seeking an abortion in Ireland.</P>
    <P>To justify this nonsense the Taoiseach has raised the spectre of the X case judgment being used to introduce what he has decided to term &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo;. In his speech on 2 October last, at the launch of the Bill, the Taoiseach stated:</P>
    <P>I think that to legislate for the decision in the X case, and, in particular, to make complex legal provision and control for the suicide risk as a ground for abortion, would commence an inevitable slide to freely available &lsquo;social abortion' in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the term &ldquo;social abortion&rdquo; means. I know of young Irish women who, during a crisis pregnancy, chose not to bring the pregnancy to full term and travelled to England for an abortion. In each and every case these women thought deeply and profoundly about the choices before them. Not one of the abortions could be termed a social abortion. Each and every decision is a profoundly personal one that no Irish woman has taken easily.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's comments at his press conference were extremely revealing. He believes that legislating for the X case would lead to &ldquo;an inevitable slide to freely available &lsquo;social abortion.'&rdquo; What the Taoiseach is really saying is that we cannot trust Irish women. He suggests that if we were to legislate for the very narrow grounds on which Irish women could obtain an abortion in the State, such as the grounds elucidated in the X case, it would not stop there. The Taoiseach's rationale for the referendum was <Col N="1355" /> even more clearly spelt out by his party colleague, Deputy O'Flynn. During his contribution last week, Deputy O'Flynn revealed the real thinking behind the Taoiseach's comments at the press launch. The Deputy declared:</P>
    <P>There is no threat to the life of a woman in the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution, but there is a ban on abortion when a woman threatens her own life. If constitutional law allowed it, it would be the easiest thing in the world for a woman to announce that she is suicidal and to threaten to commit suicide if she cannot have an abortion.</P>
    <P>There it is in a nutshell. The Government believes we must have a referendum because Irish women cannot be trusted. If one legislated for the X case, within days the mendacious mná na hÉireann would be casually declaring that they were suicidal or threatening to commit suicide just to obtain an abortion. The Government will not legislate for the X case because the women of Ireland, or at least those of a child bearing age, cannot be trusted. That is what Deputy O'Flynn said in the House last week and that is what the Taoiseach meant at his press conference.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Flynn went on to say that the X case was &ldquo;based ultimately on what a woman in a distressed state of mind was prepared to threaten to get her own way on abortion . . . The purpose of the Twenty-fifth Amendment is to put a stop to that route to abortion. There is no secret about this.&rdquo;  The premise on which this referendum is based could not be clearer. The women of Ireland cannot be trusted. To legislate for the X case would result in freely available abortion in this country because women would distort the truth and lie, even about an issue like suicide, just to get their own way on abortion, as Deputy O'Flynn told us. Shame on the Taoiseach, shame on Deputy O'Flynn and shame on Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>That the Progressive Democrats are willing to support misogynist nonsense like this beggars belief. That they are willing to support an amendment to our Constitution which denigrates and belittles Irish women is shocking. Is their love of power and perks such that the Minister and Minister of State, Deputies Harney and O'Donnell, are willing to turn a blind eye to the most anti-woman piece of legislation brought before this House in decades? I remind these two Deputies, in particular, of the clarion call to be either &ldquo;radical or redundant&rdquo; issued by the current Attorney General. We now know the answer. As far as the principles of liberalism are concerned, the Progressive Democrats are redundant. Shame on Deputies Harney and O'Donnell.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's reasoning for this Bill and the proposed referendum is repugnant to women in this country. If passed, we will continue to export to Britain and other European countries those Irish women who seek an abortion. Not one abortion will be prevented because of this refer<Col N="1356" /> endum. This referendum will result in an important right being taken away from Irish women. This right, which states that Irish women who are suicidal during a pregnancy can have an abortion in this country, is rarely used. It applies to only a very small number of Irish women but it is an important and humane right. Now that right is to be taken away. Now we are telling Irish girls and women that if they are pregnant and if the prospect of carrying the pregnancy to full term is such that they are contemplating suicide, we will force them to get on a plane, go to a lonely English city and have their pregnancy terminated there. We are telling them not to expect any sympathy or assistance from the Irish State. We are saying &ldquo;we will temporarily send you into exile, forget officially that you exist and maintain our utterly useless moral superiority in saying that Ireland is abortion-free&rdquo;. That empty, misleading formula seems to be more important than the real life trauma and heartache that some Irish women will undoubtedly face in the years to come. The hypocrisy is breathtaking.</P>
    <P>With his now customary use of weasel words, the Taoiseach has called for public debate on this issue to be informed by a &ldquo;spirit of reason, tolerance and open-mindedness&rdquo;. The Taoiseach's naivety is hardly convincing. Like many in this House, he has seen at first hand the emotions raised before in previous abortion referenda. Last July, Emily O'Reilly, an experienced commentator on these issues, stated that &ldquo;an abortion referendum, almost by definition, would be bitter and divisive&rdquo;. She is right and the Taoiseach knows it. He has lit the fuse on a divisive debate and has attempted to walk away. It is the height of political cowardice.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach wants proof of the type of debate we will soon have to endure, he need look no further than the contribution of his own Deputies to this debate. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, wasted no time in using the serious issue of schizophrenia to throw a cheap jibe across the floor of the House. Deputy Roche was hardly on his feet before using the words, &ldquo;nonsensical, illogical, extraordinary and hysterical&rdquo; in reference to Deputy Owen's speech. Not to be outdone, Deputy O'Flynn declared that &ldquo;we should show support for women's rights by helping to pursue rapists, but we cannot do so by killing innocent children&rdquo;. If the Taoiseach cannot even manage to get his own backbenchers to adhere to his call for reason, tolerance and open-mindedness, what hope is there during a referendum campaign?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The great tragedy is that the tens of thousands of Irish women who have had abortions in recent years will have to listen to this kind of nonsense. They will have to listen to fanatics on the pro-life side echoing Deputy O'Flynn's remarks about killing innocent children or worse. <Col N="1357" /> These women will have to endure this barrage of abuse in every newspaper and on every radio and television programme and for what? What purpose will this referendum serve? Its only purpose is to roll back the X case decision. Its only purpose is to force women who are suicidal &ndash; the two cases we know of involved 12 and 13 year old girls &ndash; to go to England to terminate their pregnancies. Is there any other State in the developed world which would insist on exiling people who are contemplating suicide? Is there any other State that, when confronted with the prospect of a citizen committing suicide, would decide to banish that person from its territory? That is what this referendum proposes and it is wrong. The introduction of this measure is disgraceful and I firmly believe the proposal will not win the support of the majority of Irish people.</P>
      <P>This country has matured and developed significantly in recent years. Approximately 100,000 Irish women have had an abortion since the 1983 amendment to Article 40.3.3º. These are not cold statistics. They are the real life experiences of our daughters, sisters, grand-daughters, wives and partners. Abortion is a reality in Ireland. Abortion will remain a reality in Ireland, irrespective of what happens this ludicrous constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>We do not have a debate on abortion in Ireland, we have a debate on geography. What seems to matter to the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party, the pro-life movement and the Progressive Democrats is not whether abortions occur but where they occur. To this end, thousands of women every year are sent abroad so that the myth that Ireland is abortion-free can be maintained. This referendum is another attempt to shore up that meaningless myth. If women have to borrow from money lenders to fund a trip to England, so be it. If women have to place their health at risk by having late abortions, so be it. If women have to engage in stories of a weekend away in London to maintain their privacy, so be it.</P>
      <P>Day in, day out, year in, year out, women have had to pay the price for our self-delusion on abortion. Irish women have suffered. Irish women have been plunged into debt. Irish women, at one of the most traumatic and difficult times of their lives, have been abandoned and exiled by this State. This happens so that we can pretend there is no abortion in Ireland; it happens so that we can maintain the big myth, the big lie. This is dishonest and dangerous. This Government now wants to make the situation worse. It wants to drag us back to 1983. Its proposals criminalise pregnant women and those who assist them in seeking a termination in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I restate my total opposition to this Bill and the referendum it proposes. The legislative process by which the Government intends to pass this referendum is nothing more than constitutional vandalism. Regardless of a person's views on the issue, this proposal should be rejected out of hand for the bizarre and unpre<Col N="1358" /> cedented manner in which it intends to amend the Constitution. Most dangerous of all, we are writing into the Constitution, and protecting from amendment, detailed legislation which affects the life and health of women. It will take another referendum to amend this legislation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in replying to this debate, to outline what will happen to a pregnant woman who is suicidal and cannot, for whatever reason, leave the State? This scenario was raised by Deputy O'Malley during the debate in this House on 21 October 1992 on the substantive issue at that time. The Progressive Democrats may have conveniently brushed such concerns under the carpet now, but the question is as valid today as it was then.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the terms of this legislation will tell a suicidal woman, who cannot leave the State, to continue with the pregnancy. The consequences of that approach are clear to everyone in the House. For that reason alone, this Bill should be rejected by the House, as the referendum proposing such lunacy will doubtless be rejected by the people. This referendum is unwarranted and unwanted. It is based on the principle that women cannot be trusted, that we cannot legislate for the X case because Irish women are devious liars and would use every trick in the book to qualify under the X case test. That is the simple truth of what is presented to us. That is the principle we will be asked to write into the Constitution and that is the principle the Progressive Democrats now appear to support.</P>
    <P>The referendum will ignore the experience of Irish women over the past 17 years. It will do nothing to reduce the number of abortions and will serve only to further alienate and marginalise the tens of thousands of Irish women who have opted to terminate a pregnancy since the original 1983 amendment. Ultimately, this legislation may dictate that a pregnant woman who is suicidal and cannot travel must bring the pregnancy to full term. The only other option open to that woman need not be spelt out as it is clear to everyone.</P>
    <P>This is appalling legislation. We do not need a referendum to roll back the X case decision. We should have the humanity and courage to legislate for women in a similar situation to the girl in the X case. The proposed constitutional amendment is dangerous in the extreme as it takes a right from Irish women when they are at their most vulnerable. It criminalises pregnant Irish women and is based on the principle that Irish women cannot be trusted. It does not deserve the support of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. I have listened to contributions on this Bill in recent weeks from Members on all sides of the House. We should not be surprised that there appears to be a difference of opinion as to how this matter should be dealt with. The issue of abortion has been the subject of much debate <Col N="1359" /> in Ireland and throughout the world. Regardless of the measures taken by Governments on this issue, there will not be consensus in any country. The Government cannot be held responsible for how other countries decide to address the matter of abortion.</P>
      <P>It is important when looking at this Bill to look at how this issue has been dealt with in the past so that we can understand how we have arrived at the situation in which we find ourselves today. The fact that past abortion referenda, including debates on the topic inside and outside this House, have been divisive does not mean that we should not deal with the matter today. Concerns have been expressed by Deputies who feel we should not proceed with a referendum as it may be bitter, but that is not a sufficient argument for the postponement of action on abortion.</P>
      <P>This House cannot take credit regarding this matter, given that it has taken a great length of time to deal with it. In 1992 the Supreme Court ruled that abortion is lawful if there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, including the threat of suicide, and the ruling has been with us since that year. While two of the three referenda held in 1992 to deal with the situation were successful, one was defeated. Abortion has been legal in this country since that time, although to the best of my knowledge no abortions have been carried out. It was important for the Government to respond to the Supreme Court decision. The Government has gone to great lengths to consult as widely as possible in an attempt to reach a consensus on the matter. It is obvious from the debate that has taken place in this House that such a consensus has not been reached and I do not think such a consensus will be enjoyed. Nevertheless, it is important that the Government proceeds along the lines that have been outlined.</P>
      <P>Regardless of the sides that have been taken in the abortion debate or when voting in previous referenda, most people agree that the situation that has prevailed since 1992 is unacceptable and requires action. While successive Governments have been reluctant to deal with the situation, great credit is due to the Taoiseach and his Cabinet for grasping the nettle. Abortion is not an easy subject to deal with as complex matters can arise. The Government has treated the issue in a mature fashion and I hope its efforts bear fruit.</P>
      <P>Before the Government came to office, the Taoiseach gave a commitment to deal with the issue of abortion. Shortly after he became Taoiseach, he announced that a Green Paper would be published on abortion, and that happened two years later. At all times the public and interested bodies were invited to participate and the consultation that took place was as wide as there has ever been on any matter. All submissions were given consideration before publication of the Green Paper and no individual or group should have felt ignored in the consultation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following its publication, the Government referred the Green Paper to the All-Party Com<Col N="1360" /> mittee on the Constitution for consideration. Like many other speakers, I pay tribute to all members of the committee for the long hours they put in to consider the Green Paper. The medical profession, representatives of various Churches and many experts in different areas were given the opportunity to state their cases and to explain how they would like to see the matter resolved. While the committee did not agree on the best way to proceed, every effort was made to appreciate and understand the huge complexities that surround the abortion issue.</P>
    <P>I listened to speakers this evening talking about turning back the clock to the situation before 1983. I am convinced that most Irish people consider themselves to be pro-life. While they are anxious to have a ban on abortion, they are also anxious to ensure that best medical practice is protected and that women in need of urgent medical care during pregnancy are allowed and afforded the necessary attention. The question of what the Government is trying to do has been asked. The purpose of the proposed constitutional amendment is to deal with the most unsatisfactory legal situation that has existed since the 1992 Supreme Court decision. While there is no such thing as perfect legislation, I am convinced that the formula presented by the Government is inspirational and I commend all those involved in its production.</P>
    <P>Many questions have been asked in the year since the all-party committee published its report and the Government announced its plan to deal with the abortion issue. The two most important questions, however, relate to what will happen if the proposal is carried and what will happen if it is defeated. If the Government is successful, it can be said with certainty that three things will happen. Maximum protection for the unborn will be ensured, the medical treatment required to protect the life of pregnant women will be provided and future change on this matter will only be made in a referendum. When the proposal becomes law, no future Government will be able to change it. If the proposal is defeated, abortion will become a reality in Ireland. It will be permitted for any woman who can prove a real or substantial threat to her life. The courts will have to decide who can or cannot have an abortion. I am not convinced that such a scenario is desired by the people. They would like to bring some clarity to a situation that has been clouded for almost 20 years.</P>
    <P>I thank the Government for its efforts in trying to bring some clarity to this matter. I accept that some people have genuine problems with the proposal. People should think seriously about the consequences of their vote in the referendum. It is ten years since the Government dealt with the matter. The opportunity being presented is as a result of a long process of consultation, deliberation and debate. I doubt such an opportunity will be presented again for a long time if the Government proposal is defeated next year.</P>
    <P>While I respect the duty and the right of all parties and individuals in the House to state their <Col N="1361" /> own case, it is a pity we do not have cross-party support on the issue. Perhaps some of the Opposition were caught offside by the Government's announcement of a referendum and as a result are reluctant to support the measure proposed by Government. The only opinion coming from the Labour Party seems to be from those who might consider themselves the liberal wing of the party and they imply that the proposal is crazy and off the wall.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the vast majority of Irish people will support the proposal when it is put to them in a referendum next year. I am convinced too that many members of the Opposition support the Government's proposal but are reluctant to express that view in the House. It is unfortunate that politics and the prospect of a general election have been allowed to cloud people's judgment on the issue. That is unnecessary and brings a lack of clarity to the situation.</P>
    <P>We have dealt successfully with the issue of travel and information but the real or substantive issue of abortion has yet to be dealt with. People have been critical of the decision by the Government that the risk of suicide will not be acceptable grounds for an abortion. Any fair-minded person should accept that to allow a threat of suicide provide justification for aborting a child is not acceptable and cannot be tolerated. I am pleased the Government has decided to remove that. That is not to say, as Deputy Stagg suggested, that the Government does not trust the women of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our duty is to legislate and provide leadership. It may seem hypocritical to bring in legislation preventing women from having abortion in this country and at the same time allow a situation where people can travel to Britain and have abortions, but it is not our duty to legislate for Britain. We have enough to do to provide the best legislation we can in the best interests of the country, and I do not apologise for supporting the Government in that. None of us had a say in our conception or birth, or the circumstances surrounding our birth. It is important that the unborn are protected and I am honoured to support the measure proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>People have written and spoken about abortion in the case of rape. It is difficult for us to be critical of the actions of parents who find themselves with a young daughter in this terrible situation. I do not wish to pass judgment on parents who feel pressurised into taking a particular course of action in such a situation, but I would like to think that if I were in a similar situation I would give the same consideration to the unborn child as I would to my own. Irish women have travelled to Britain for abortions for many years. The Taoiseach mentioned that 18 Irish women a day have abortions in Britain. For every woman travelling to Britain, there is a father of a child so we are not just talking of 18 women but of 18 women and their partners. Unwanted pregnancies are obviously a huge problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" /> I welcome the establishment of the new Crisis Pregnancy Agency as announced by the Minister for Health and Children last month. The job of the agency is to draw up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy and promote options other than abortion where a pregnancy occurs and to provide for post-abortion services. The Government will be providing £5 million next year to fund the new agency which has a very difficult job. It will have many clients desperately in need of help.</P>
    <P>Listening to the contributions of several Members this evening would lead one to believe that abortion answers all problems. While it might provide relief for some, studies show that in the long-term it can create more problems than it solves. Looking back as a nation we can only be ashamed of our treatment of young single women who became pregnant in years past. Pressure was brought to bear on them, forcing them to take the boat to England rather than cause embarrassment to their families at home. We all know of situations where young women who became pregnant were left with the choice of abortion or adoption. The shame families felt led to the alienation and isolation of their pregnant daughters who were put into hiding until after the birth of the child.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that there have been major changes in our attitudes and that we have become more tolerant. We must accept that many children born today are born out of wedlock, but that does not make them any less valuable than children born to married couples. We often refer to the vulnerable in our society. A country can be judged by how it looks after those who cannot look after themselves. The unborn are the most vulnerable group of all and I am proud and satisfied to support the Government proposal to protect the unborn.</P>
    <P>News of a pregnancy is usually greeted with much joy and expectation but for some it can be a terrible crisis. A teenager still at school or college, a young woman making a career for herself or an older woman concerned about her health and that of her baby might be forced to take the boat to England. I ask people not to be judgmental. We are all mature adults and responsible for our own actions but we should not be too critical of people with whose actions we might not agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Abortion has been an emotive, difficult and divisive issue in this country over many years. Here we are again faced with a constitutional referendum on an issue that almost nowhere else in the world is dealt with by way of the Constitution. We must surely ask what is so different about Irish women and their pregnancies that they must be dealt with by way of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, the Taoiseach and the Ministers, in presenting this legislation, have told us that these proposals are reasonable and middle ground. Are they reasonable? Are they middle <Col N="1363" /> ground? The Ministers insist that the proposals represent a fair, reasonable and compassionate approach. They protest too much. The basic assumptions in the presentations of the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, are that they are taking a fair, reasonable and compassionate approach, but this is a flawed belief.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Government is seeking to have the Bill discussed in committee rather than on the floor of the House where it can be examined and put under further scrutiny. That would be the right thing to do and we owe it to the people to scrutinise this Bill very carefully and to present to the people the choice which the Government is offering. By all means let us have a debate which is measured, mature and thoughtful, but let that not be a cover for accepting unreasonable, anti-woman, insensitive, unethical, hypocritical and politically-driven proposals. These proposals come before us because the Taoiseach made a commitment in the course of a campaign, although it was not in the programme for Government, and now finds himself under pressure from four Independent Deputies and from lobby groups which have put this and previous Governments under pressure on this issue. By 2010, if not sooner, this legislation will be seen as a time-warped reflection on society and social policy, as Government hypocrisy. It is utterly extraordinary on the one hand to talk of excluding suicide and of criminalising a desperate woman and threatening her with 12 years imprisonment if she attempts to have an abortion while on the other hand to protest loudly that the Government will in no way deter such a woman from going to England for an abortion. The Taoiseach did so at his press conference, the Minister has done so in the House and the Bill does so on page 3.</P>
    <P>On the one hand the legislation denies that 7,000 Irish women have abortions in England every year. We have seen the statistics recently which show that the number is increasing. The denial of this fact looms over the legislation which criminalises the women involved and excludes suicidal women from having a procedure to save their lives. That is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>Of course, laws alone cannot deal adequately with the tragic realities of crisis pregnancies but surely our Constitution does not have to be used in this extraordinary way. Combining a law and a constitutional change into a single instrument reduces the constitutional powers and obligations of Members of this House. Our Constitution is not the right place to deal with this sensitive and difficult personal crisis for women. If we wanted to help women in this crisis we would not criminalise them in the Constitution. We would not write the kind of measures proposed here into the Constitution. We would be dealing with this issue by way of legislation. Why are we putting the morning after pill into the fundamental law of our written Constitution? Why should a new method <Col N="1364" /> of incorporating a law into the Constitution be used on this occasion and on this issue when the crisis for the woman concerned will not be averted in any way by this measure?</P>
    <P>This is an extraordinary and bizarre way to meddle with the Constitution, which has stood us in good stead, and it does not address the issue. The format proposed to deal with the issue of abortion could be called an emergency and exceptional one. If we were serious about dealing with the issue we would handle it in a totally different way. The tone of the Minister's speech seems to envisage hordes of women rushing for abortions like lemmings over a cliff, if the legislation is not passed. The Government appears to assume that this Bill and the medical profession are the only constraints on Irish women using abortion. Are we saying that a constitutional amendment is critical in stopping thousands more Irish women seeking an abortion or that it is the instrument which will protect the country? What about Irish women's good judgment and their demonstrated commitment to parenting and mothering over generations? Deputy Stagg spoke very well about the assumption that Irish women cannot be trusted and that a constitutional amendment is necessary to stop this extraordinary move that Irish women will make in relation to their pregnancies.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of basic trust about how Irish women handle pregnancy. The endless references to social abortion are an example of intellectual acrobatics. These statements tell us much about the speakers' views of the hundreds of thousands of women who have already gone to England for abortions. Deputy Mitchell has referred to the isolation of these women. Isolation has affected not only the women concerned but often their families and their partners. Now it is proposed to amend the Constitution and to criminalise them to an extraordinary degree. It is almost as if such Irish women are seen to act with inferior social motives and do not have good enough reasons to do what they do. The proposal is a commentary on these women who are not willing to become physical and mental wrecks. It is almost as if we question their qualification as Irish women. Are they only good enough to be dumped somewhere else?</P>
    <P>We are concerned with the effects of Sellafield but this is tantamount to us asking England to take our women in these difficult situations, women that we do not want to talk about or deal with in any comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>What is the assumption about the UK and its medical services and how we intend to use them, now and in the future? The references to freedom to travel appear to suggest that it is the opinion of the Government that English based doctors and nurses are capable of acts which in this proposal are close to homicide and which, if undertaken here, will attract equivalent sanctions. Yet, we are happy to allow women to travel to England.</P>
    <P>The Bill is tainted with a fundamentalism which locks women's reproductive rights into a <Col N="1365" /> constitutional framework in an extraordinary way. It amounts to a form of foetal protectionism which fails to find a middle ground of accommodating the rights of pregnant women to be treated with due regard. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, put it very well when, in a speech in 1995 on reproductive rights, she referred to the hard won rights of Irish women. It is disappointing to note the different tone she is adopting now but I recommend that people read the speech she made then.</P>
    <P>Am I to understand as a woman, mother and Deputy that the only things standing in the way of Irish women descending into this unstoppable morass of abortion seeking behaviour are the medical profession and this proposed amendment? I do not apologise for repeating what has been said, that the tone of the amendment is patriarchal and misogynist in its entirety. It implies that women who travel to England are extraordinary, that they do not really belong here and that they are not Irish. Indeed, there is almost a denial of the reality of their existence, apart from the reference to the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, which must be welcomed. I hope we will be able to discuss in greater detail the statutory instrument to establish it.</P>
    <P>Why are the hands of the Oireachtas being tied in terms of helping these women from a legislative point of view, now or in the future? Why is the Constitution being perverted to deal with this issue? It is an abandonment of democracy in an attempt to pander to a lobby group. It also amounts to a control of women's reproductive rights.</P>
    <P>The choice being presented is false and flawed. A number of Deputies, especially in the Fianna Fáil Party, have said the choice is between accepting this referendum or abortion on demand. That is a false presentation of the facts. There is no evidence that abortion on demand is wanted in this country and it is clear that Irish women should be medically protected where there is a threat to their life as a result of a pregnancy. Any right minded person would agree with that. Such protection should have legal sanction and we should give obstetricians the protection of the law for the difficult decisions that must occasionally be made in the course of pregnancy. It is equally clear that the morning after pill and contraceptives currently available should be legalised but it is absurd to do this through the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Key questions arise regarding the constitutional mechanism, including the way Ireland should be governed. It tips the balance away from the Legislature. Deputy Gay Mitchell referred to the changes involving the President and these are addressed in the Fine Gael amendment. This, and the changes involving the Supreme Court and the ministerial orders which can vary the effects of a constitutional provision raise fundamental questions about the balance of power and the role of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> There has been much talk about the extent of the consultation that took place when drafting the legislation but the fact that there was wide consultation does not mean that a right solution will be found. I pay great tribute to the work done by the All Party Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the way the consultation process took place. It was excellent and we should use it again as a future model. However, the process illustrated that there were differences of opinion on how to proceed. For example, Dr. Whitaker and his distinguished colleagues said that legislation was the only way forward to deal with the issue of suicide.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, this issue involves leadership and a Government decision on taking the best way forward. It is about Government and governance. The Government has not chosen the best way forward, indeed there is an abandonment of Government in the attempt to once again take the constitutional route. The people expressed their opinion in 1992 by voting yes to travel, yes to information and no to the substantive issue.</P>
    <P>In terms of the history of the Constitution the mechanism is wrong. Putting detailed legislative provisions of this kind into the Constitution has huge implications for human rights. Section 2(3) refers to aiding, abetting and counselling. It seeks to criminalise actions in areas of communication that fall short of abortion and has the potential to open up huge areas of constitutional challenge on the nature of freedom of expression. The Minister must address this aspect.</P>
    <P>The legislation treats women as if they were infantile in their behaviour. It suggests that they are irresponsible and immature and need constitutional safeguards to stop them otherwise committing serious and dangerous acts. I am convinced the Government takes the view that women are almost incapable of making moral decisions.</P>
    <P>The eighth amendment of the Constitution, dealing with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, will no longer be vindicated since it is proposed that suicidal women will no longer be protected. The legislation proposes that women will attract less protective worth, which is a serious problem. It must be asked, therefore, if the proposal is reasonable and does it find middle ground. Would a reasonable man or woman consider it appropriate?</P>
    <P>Let me consider the approach in the rest of the EU. Ireland will be the only country that will prohibit abortion in its Constitution. Apart from the UK, Ireland will be the only country that will not allow suicide as grounds for an abortion and, apart from the UK, it will be the only country that does not allow the cases of young girls who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest as grounds for abortion. Is the rest of the EU unreasonable? Is it reasonable to remove suicide entirely? Surely a middle ground approach would have been to define mechanisms for the assessment of suicide very carefully. Would the middle ground not leave this issue to the Oireachtas and <Col N="1367" /> the legislators, who are elected to enact laws? What would a reasonable mother or father occupying the middle ground want for their 14 year old child, a daughter who is pregnant as result of rape? Surely, at the least they would want to be free to consider a variety of options for her future in this country?</P>
    <P>Rape giving rise to pregnancy is a major crisis for the woman involved. The Government's seven point reply cites issues of consent and prosecution. They are almost arguments against rape as an indictable offence, not against it as a ground for abortion.</P>
    <P>The Government's reply to the question of incest and pregnancy is tantamount to asking a reasonable man or woman to go along with an incestuous pregnancy. Is there such a thing as a middle ground on incest and a resulting pregnancy? This is a very difficult issue but is a constitutional reply a middle ground response? The Government's middle ground is to pretend it does not happen and to constitutionally say that we will never consider dealing sympathetically through our laws with a young woman who has been raped. Is that reasonable?</P>
    <P>For many years the Church prescribed sexual and moral behaviour for women. Why should the State take on this role at a time when separation of Church and State is a given and when religious belief is a ground for non-discrimination in our equality laws? Why should the Government seek to endow one view of the protection of human life with a constitutional lock? As institutional religion recedes among some strata of the population, why should the State advance itself as the new protector, making a charge of the light brigade through our Constitution?</P>
    <P>Would a reasonable woman who could be potentially pregnant or her partner be worried by this legislation? They would because unexpectedly their planned and wanted pregnancy could become a health and life threatening condition for the woman, and the Constitution would not protect the family. Such a woman has every right to be worried under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is no certainty the UK will forever permit abortions to be carried out on Irish women who travel to the UK. This area needs further discussion but I do not have time to go into it now.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, talked about being sincere, genuine and honest. Women know more than most that many laws have been passed which were honest, sincere and wrong, and this is another of them. It is Pontius Pilate legislation which washes our hands of women, of care and of counselling. It washes our hands of the X and C cases. The proposal is neither reasonable nor middle ground, but injurious and insensitive. It reduces women's rights. It is democracy taking a hit. The Dáil remains the bulwark of democracy, even if good times have caused citizens to take it for granted. There has been consultation; the Government has asked the <Col N="1368" /> audience, telephoned a friend and opted for 50:50 as a middle ground. Many people have been asked but the solution is not good enough and I regret that the protective spirit in the Title of the Bill is not directed at women. The Government that expects 60% of women to take up paid employment under the national employment action plan, often without child care, at the same time expects them to accept legislation over their ova in the Constitution. This law infantilises women, who were treated as minors by the Catholic Church in the past. It will not stop one woman from having an abortion in England. It denies the reality of the problem here and expects another country to deal with our social problems. It builds in a constitutional level of denial which is dangerous and frightening. The Constitution will be aesthetically perfect in forbidding abortion, but pity the women whose decisions will spoil this purist picture and who by their reality will be treated as repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I hope that if this is put to the people they will reject it. I hope the people will get every opportunity in the next few weeks and months to hear in detail and understand the legislation, and I hope we can debate it on Committee Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. In particular I want to deal with suicide in the context of the Bill. I am president and director of the Irish Association of Suicidology, but the views I express are not those of the association, though I have discussed it with many members of the association by way of informing myself.</P>
      <P>Without doubt suicide is a terrible act against human nature. It creates terrible difficulties and trauma for family, community and friends. The level of suicide is unacceptable and we urgently need suicide prevention programmes. Suicide was part of the hidden Ireland. Less than ten years ago it was the responsibility of the Department of Justice as it was a crime; the Department of Health had no involvement. It was taboo and the stigma surrounding it ensured it was not debated or discussed. The first discussions which took place in the Houses were tentative and people were very frightened of discussing it as they did not understand it and because of the implications it has in terms of thinking about people taking their own lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we have made much progress since the publication of the report of the national task force on suicide, we have a long way to go. Last year, 413 people died by suicide, while 415 died in road accidents. There is agreement that suicides are under-recorded, though not by much, so it is fair to say more died by suicide last year than in road accidents. In response to recent parliamentary questions the Minister informed me that £1.2 million was spent last year on suicide prevention and research. If one does not count Garda costs, £21.174 million was spent on road accidents, and rightly so &ndash; it was probably not <Col N="1369" /> enough &ndash; almost 20 times the amount spent on preventing suicide.</P>
    <P>The issues concerning suicide and pregnancy have been simplified. It is an extremely complex issue. There are women who are pregnant and suicidal who can be shepherded through their pregnancies and who after the births can fully recover and lead full lives. There are others who are depressed or suffering from suicidal ideation before becoming pregnant, through the pregnancy and after the pregnancy due to mental illness. It is also recognised that there are a few women who are deeply traumatised during pregnancy who are suicidal and are likely to take their own lives. The Government rightly says a pregnant woman in danger of death because of a physical injury must have her life protected. Does it not discriminate against those who are mentally ill to say a woman in serious danger of death because of her mental illness cannot be protected in the same way? It is discriminatory to say a woman who is seriously suicidal and who is suffering from a serious mental health condition cannot be protected in terms of terminating her pregnancy while this can be done where a woman is in real danger of death due to a physical illness.</P>
    <P>It will be said that those who have mental illness or are suicidal may not recover from their condition if the pregnancy is terminated, and that is so, but a person who is physically ill may not recover if she receives treatment which terminates the pregnancy. For example, a person with cancer whose treatment results in terminating the pregnancy may not recover.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that the Government immediately reverse its housing policies which have proved totally counter productive and that it urgently moves to restore confidence in a housing market where under-provision is causing widespread misery and notes the growing crisis in housing provision, the growing number of homeless people, the £100,000,000 plus annual bill for rent subsidies, the failure of the &lsquo;affordable housing' programme, the inability of employed young couples to purchase their own home, the loss of confidence in the housing sector by buyers, builders and lenders, the total inability of local authorities to deliver housing in sufficient numbers, the collapse of provision in the rental market and the consequent dramatic increases in rents and the catastrophic reduction in private housing building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> I wish to share my time with Deputies Farrelly, Durkan, Neville and McCormack.</P>
    <P>Prior to 11 September we had a vibrant economy full of confidence for the future. Output was growing very strongly, investment was high, the population was expanding and demand and spending was growing. In every sector people were working longer and harder and investing more and more each year in an effort to meet the ever growing demand for goods and services from a wealthier and growing population.</P>
    <P>This was true in virtually every sector of the economy with one exception, the housing sector. Housing bucked the trend and has been bucking the trend for almost three years. In this sector the slow down in investment long preceded 11 September and the Government cannot blame bin Laden or any outside influences for the crisis we now face. Because of the time lag in house production we will continue to face this crisis for some time to come. This is a Government-induced crisis, the result of policy initiatives each and every one of which has had an outcome precisely the reverse of which was required. When taken together, all these perverse incentives have produced massive uncertainty in the market and have stripped all confidence from buyers, builders and lenders, all of whom are leaving the market in droves. It took some level of incompetence from the Government to produce this turn around in such a short few years.</P>
    <P>Even when confidence was high in the economy generally Government housing policy was counter-productive and inappropriate. Now that the economic climate is entirely changed these policies are catastrophic and must be reversed. Instead of being counter-cyclical in order to stimulate demand and supply they are reinforcing the downward trend in housing activity and, consequently, the downward trend in the economy generally. The evidence of this is all around us every day and everywhere, in every city, town and village and it is very difficult to understand how the Government can be so insulated from reality and so isolated from events which are evident for everyone else to see. Even if it is so entrenched in its ivory tower that it does not see it for itself, surely it has economic advisers and consultants to quantify the disastrous impacts. Surely it has enough friends in the building industry to whisper in its ear the reality of what is happening on the ground.</P>
    <P>This is a Government-induced crisis and only a complete reversal of policy can help mitigate its effects. It is only mitigation we can now hope for. Because of the time lag in house production, the time between applying for planning permission and making a decision to invest and bringing a house to market, any change in policy now will not produce results for another three to four years in terms of output, just as we are beginning to see the real impact of Government decisions taken as far back as 1998, even though the signs have been there for anyone who wished to see <Col N="1371" /> them. There is no point in the Minister telling us about the high output last year. This had nothing to do with the Government, it was as a result of investment decisions made up to four years prior to last year. The Minister told us how high output would be this year. It is now anticipated that it will not even reach 40,000, which was a huge drop.</P>
    <P>Planning applications are down 9% this year to September. Registration of housing starts is down 21% and that is just until September. Heaven knows what the drop will be by the end of the year. Those who have land are not applying for permission to build, those who have permission are not building, those who are building have slowed down the rate of output, sites are being closed down, jobs are being shed and some builders have gone into liquidation in recent months. All of this is happening against a background where it is stated Government policy to meet housing demand by increasing output to 50,000 units a year and where it exhorted the industry to gear up and engage specialists and skills to sustain that output over the next ten years. Those builders who did so and bought land at highly inflated prices, including local authorities, must now be feeling very sore about a Government whose perverse incentives guaranteed this objective could not be achieved. When it became obvious this could not be achieved, they were too intransigent to accept the evidence and reversed the policies which caused such problems.</P>
    <P>As far back as the first Bacon report, against a background of overnight queuing by young couples, escalating prices and gazumping the problem was identified as under supply. While this was evident to the dogs in the street and it was the clear message of the Bacon reports, the only Government response should have been to increase supply. Why then did the Government do everything possible to dampen supply and when it became evident that supply was falling why did it persist in these policies? God only knows what perverse thinking produced a rule that ensured planning permission lapsed if an entire estate was not completed to external wall stage within two years of granting permission? The impact of this was immediate and predictable. Banks immediately were unwilling to extend financing on the basis of a time constraint permission. Costs increased and smaller permissions were sought for partial site development.</P>
    <P>Almost every builder now faces a situation whereby if he wants to finish a site he will be forced back into the vagaries of the planning system, clogging it up further, slowing down output of housing, increasing costs to buyers and leaving half finished estates for years on end. Almost every significant planning permission granted since August 1999 will fall foul of this requirement and its effect on slowing down supply will be with us for years. Even when the remainder of the economy recovers, as the Minister for Finance suggests it might by the end of next year, we will <Col N="1372" /> not be in a position to produce houses because the planning permissions will not exist. This is the best case scenario because in good times builders might go to the trouble, expense and uncertainty of renewing planning permissions in order to finish estates.</P>
    <P>In the current climate why on earth would they bother? It is far easier for them to build in Lisbon or London or sit on the land indefinitely until the climate changes. It is absolutely crucial to amend section 96 to ensure the normal five year period of planning permission pertains to all existing permissions. The reason for that measure has now gone and there is no point maintaining it any further. I ask the Minister of State to listen to that request because everyone in the building industry is saying the same thing. It is stopping the building of houses.</P>
    <P>Equally inexplicable was the decision to remove mortgage interest relief on rental properties. Interest payments on borrowings are a deductible business expense throughout the tax code. Apart from the fact that it seems strangely inequitable that one type of business should be treated more onerously than others, it defies belief that the one sector singled out for this treatment was the very one for which we most need an incentive. What on earth was the Government thinking, that it allowed this totally bizarre measure go ahead? The effect was immediate, devastating and totally predictable. All new supply of rental accommodation ceased. Rents sky-rocketed by at least an amount equivalent to the loss in interest relief. For the first time in history rents are now 25% to 30% more than a mortgage on a similar house, ensuring that no young couple could ever hope to save for a new home. Those who might have rented in the past, and even those who aspired to home ownership at some stage, are now forced to put themselves on waiting lists of local authorities who do not and will not have the potential to fill the void left by private investors.</P>
    <P>Every public representative at every level and in every party must have heard the heartbreaking stories of human misery caused by the lack of rental accommodation. It has affected the entire market from top to bottom but its impact has been most devastating for those who are most vulnerable at the very bottom of the market. Many single older people who felt they had secure rental accommodation and a home for life are now almost starving themselves to pay increased rents. There is nothing more heartbreaking than the countless families every public representative hears about, many single-parent families, who in order to avail of the safety net of rental subsidies must take their children from school in order to relocate to areas in the city where lower rents apply. If that was not enough, they must also give up their jobs or any hope of jobs in order to qualify for the subsidy and put a roof over their heads. The rental subsidy scheme is costing the taxpayer a massive sum of well over £100 million a year. It is causing as many social <Col N="1373" /> problems as it is solving and utterly unnecessary to have so many people depending on it.</P>
    <P>Any thinking Government would recognise that home ownership is not the only or even the most desirable form of accommodation. Every modern economy needs a vibrant and professionally managed rental sector to cater for a mobile labour force as well as providing for the accommodation needs of those who can never aspire to home ownership, or choose not to aspire to it. There is no sense whatsoever in ensuring the private sector will not meet the demand. The removal of interest relief has simply resulted in a switch in the flow of available investment funds into either commercial or industrial developments, both of which are now over-supplied, or into overseas investment. It is estimated that a massive £900 million has gone into property investments overseas since this measure was introduced in mid-1998. In short, this has been a disastrous measure, both socially and economically, and if the Government does nothing else in the few months left to it, it must restore interest deductibility for the provision of rental accommodation.</P>
    <P>Stamp duty is another area of Government incompetence in which its regime has increased housing costs and added rigidity to the market, thereby discouraging both trading up and trading down, preventing optimal use of the housing stock and inhibiting labour mobility. Stamp duty is a transaction tax purely and simply aimed at raising revenue for the Government which it is not even doing efficiently any more because it is now so penal. The minimum now required is to widen the bands to reflect higher house prices and abolish the ridiculous 9% rate altogether. Stamp duties are not just high, they are extraordinarily complex. There have been no less than four changes in as many years and, even within the industry, most do not know the precise rate which applies in any given set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>No market and no business can operate successfully and prosper in a climate of such uncertainty, where the taxes applicable are constantly changing. If the Government wants a regime which encourages housing supply and the optimal use of housing stock, it needs to give some serious thought to how it proposes to achieve this, before it jumps in with any more ludicrous schemes such as those it has given us to date. Taken together, these schemes have sapped all confidence from the industry and left a whole generation with no hope of a home of their own.</P>
    <P>Many problems are being encountered as a result of Government measures. For instance, the new planning Act was designed to streamline and speed up planning. In reality, the process is now slower than ever, due to lack of resources and the greater responsibilities being thrown at local authorities and An Bórd Pleanála, which is now holding up the roads programme as well as the housing programme. This, again, is entirely due to Government mismanagement. The implementation of the 20% social and affordable housing <Col N="1374" /> schemes, which had appeared to offer so much, varies from one local authority to another. It takes endless negotiation and is hugely time consuming for local authorities, which are already taxed to the limit in trying to deliver on all aspects of the national development plan. Even when money was plentiful, they could only deliver a modest increase in social housing. What prospects are there for families, now that the money has evaporated and the future is so uncertain?</P>
    <P>If the Government wishes to consider the housing sector in terms of helping those most in need, I suggest that first-time buyers are most deserving. Innovative ideas are needed to help those who, otherwise, have no hope of getting off the housing lists. A lower, or zero, VAT rate on new houses in the social and affordable category is one option which is quite feasible within European law and which already operates in Britain and most European countries. A once-off tax credit of £5,000 for first-time buyers is another possible approach. Those first-time buyers who do not qualify for any of the schemes are being deprived of all hope. The serviced land initiative, under which some 100,000 sites were envisaged by the end of this year, has delivered no more than half that expectation.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind the Government, yet again, of the social consequences of its ill judged policies. The generation which apparently had it all, which was told by the Government to break open the champagne and grew up in times of unprecedented growth, now finds it cannot aspire to home ownership. Unlike their parents and grandparents, they are deprived of this most basic need. For those in a position to even consider purchasing, the only available options may involve moving up to 100 miles from their families, friends and support networks. They are crippled with high mortgages and long commuting hours and we will live with the consequences of this dispersed method of settlement for many generations. Meanwhile, these young couples have zero quality of life and their stress levels are mounting even higher as every job becomes uncertain. Nevertheless, they are the lucky ones. For those forced into an ever contracting rental market or onto ever lengthening council waiting lists, there is even less light at the end of the tunnel. This is what this generation has inherited from the so-called champagne years.</P>
    <P>If the Government has no concern for the plight of those seeking accommodation, perhaps it would consider the economic costs of its policies. Every single one of its policy initiatives has inhibited labour mobility at a time when it was never more important. Under-supply of housing will continue to put upward pressure on wages, even in bad economic times. Housing output comprises 11% of our GNP and represented £1.5 billion in taxes to the Exchequer in the year 2000. Can we afford to forgo that? There were 70,000 directly employed in the industry last year. I suggest the Government cannot risk those jobs. <Col N="1375" /> However, all this is now being jeopardised as jobs are being shed in the industry and the lack of confidence generated in the housing sector is spreading throughout the economy. It is time for the Government to admit it was wrong and reverse the policies producing precisely the opposite results to what is now required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I should declare an interest in relation to my business of selling houses over the last 20 years. In relation to recent comments by the Minister for Finance, I might paraphrase the words of a once popular song as follows:</P>
      <P>Where have all the billions gone, short time passing,</P>
      <P>Where have all the billions gone, because of the housing downturn.</P>
      <P>To a large extent, the loss is due to the policies implemented by the Government. On present indications, when some 15,000 to 25,000 people in the construction industry get their Christmas holiday pay, they will be told there are no jobs for them after Christmas. Those on the Government side of the House should listen to somebody who is trying to provide jobs and take notice of the number of jobs being lost on a weekly and monthly basis, which will amount to a massive total by the end of the year. One of the main causes is the Government's mismanagement of the construction industry and the implementation of the three Bacon reports during the term of office of the present Minister for the Environment and Local Government. This has devastated the industry throughout the country, not just in Dublin. The decision to take the investor out of the market by not allowing interest relief on mortgages against the capital and the increased stamp duty from 6% to 9% dealt a hammer blow to Irish investors. It turned their sights towards purchasing property abroad &ndash; mainly in the United Kingdom, Spain and Portugal &ndash; which has sent colossal amounts of money out of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>This action by the Government was based on a report from an individual who knew as little about the building industry as he knows about the sugar industry, in which people are out of work today as a result of his proposals being taken on board by the Irish Sugar Company. For example, in Navan, rent for a three bedroom semi-detached house has gone from £450 per month to between £600 and £650 per month and the situation is much worse in Dublin. Students who came to Dublin this year could not get accommodation at less than £85 or £90 per week for one room. This year alone, it is estimated the Government will pay out £134 million in rent subsidies through the health boards, as compared to £76.5 million when it came into office. I asked if the difference had been put into the servicing of land, would the problem not be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> The second major decision, proposed by Mr. Bacon and implemented by the Government, was the introduction of the social and affordable housing policy. Builders had to provide 20% of the land for this purpose. In many cases where sites were expensive, it is not possible to build the houses and provide them for the amounts of money that the Department of the Environment and Local Government has informed the local authorities they can pay for them. What will happen? Building will not take place.</P>
    <P>As a result of these two Government decisions, introduced by the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, we could see housing completions drop from a high in 2000 of 46,000 to about 30,000 next year. That is a stark reality if we look at the number of sites that have closed to date and the number of houses that will not finish between April and June.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, with the Attorney General, demanded at a Cabinet meeting that stamp duty be 9%. I propose that in the budget stamp duty be reduced to 5% on properties under £150,000. I propose that the interest relief be abolished and that the first time buyers' grant be increased from £3,000 to £10,000.</P>
    <P>On 15 July, the Meath county manager introduced an increase in development levies from £3,600 to £8,600 during a downturn in the building industry. These are for water supply, sewerage facilities, surface water and community facilities, the majority of which should come from the coffers of the State. The Government is taking over 40% of the cost of a first time buyer's house through different taxes but it has failed to provide sufficient funds to service the lands.</P>
    <P>Along with other Meath county councillors, I asked what would happen to the social housing policy if there were a serious downturn in the economy. After a lengthy debate I was told that it would be binned. Is it the policy of the Department of the Environment and Local Government that if the social and affordable housing scheme does not work, it will be binned? If that is the case when will this be announced?</P>
    <P>The price of sites is the real problem. When the Government reduced capital gains tax from 40% to 20% it had the opportunity to deal with this issue, without implementing the social housing policy, by telling land owners it wanted a percentage of their land at three times the agricultural rate. This would have provided all the sites required at £3,000 per site. I suggested it but the Government did not listen. Will someone today listen so that we might get the kind of major industry here that has kept the Celtic tiger running over recent years to rejuvenate the economy and bring significant income to the State?</P>
    <P>Since the Government came into office in 1997 there has been unprecedented growth but the Minister has failed to provide sufficient funds to local authorities to service sites for development. As a result developers, who went to the local authority looking for planning permission, were <Col N="1377" /> asked to provide money to service the inner relief roads. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government opened three of them in Navan. Who paid for them? They were paid for by the ordinary person buying a house for the first time. The developer was asked to pay for it and passed this on to the house buyers. The Government collected 40% of the total income and never gave any of it back to service the areas where people wanted to live. The only reason people moved to these areas was that they could afford the houses there.</P>
    <P>This Minister has left a legacy of disaster. Does he or his colleagues realise how ill advised they were in, first, employing Mr. Bacon &ndash; I hope they did not pay him &ndash; second, implementing his proposals and, third, allowing the economy go into a tailspin as a result of their policies which had no foundation or foresight? This has left a bleak future for 25,000 families as we approach Christmas.</P>
    <P>We all want to see cheaper houses. This could have been dealt with without the legislation that was introduced, which put severe penalties on developers from the point of view of planning applications as mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell. I believe the Minister is honest enough to admit he has got it wrong and I hope that on budget day, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will bring forward proposals to rectify the problem and put some backbone into the economy which has been destroyed in the past two years.</P>

      <P>One would tend to be sympathetic to the Minister in his unenviable position, presiding over the most awful housing crisis since the foundation of the State. Since he is a Minister in Cabinet, albeit he only sits on a three legged stool down at the end of the table, he must accept responsibility for what has happened since he and his Government came into office. When he came into office, there were 35,000 to 40,000 people on local authority waiting lists; there are now 80,000. When he came into office, rents were at an affordable level; they have trebled in the time he has been in office. He has now joined the unenviable list of Ministers who presides over a waiting list longer than any experienced previously. He has managed to do that at a time of unknown wealth and resources, which are unparalleled in the history of the State. How did he do it? What help did he have? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to say the public will have little sympathy. I know it may be unfair to say so and I know that the Minister is a decent man, but he has seriously neglected his job, as has his senior Minister. What has he been doing? Has he listened to the words of the people in this House who have repeatedly brought his attention <Col N="1378" /> to the plight of the people waiting to find a house they can afford?</P>
      <P>In my constituency, there are about 2,700 families on the waiting list. In addition there are another 2,000 families who cannot afford a house. There is no place they can go to get a house they can afford. If they want to pay £500,000 for a house they will have no problem, but what about the majority of people who are working their way up and deserve some kind of recognition? What has happened? Absolutely nothing.</P>
      <P>In our constituencies we almost have to counsel people who cannot get a house. We can talk it over with them, tell them how bad it is and empathise with them, but we can do nothing for them because the Government has neglected them. The Government has welshed on its responsibility and has no intention of doing anything further.</P>
      <P>I am only a short time in this House by comparison to the Minister for State. However if I presided over what he has presided over for the last four years, I would be ashamed of myself. Consider what the public have to look forward to. They are not looking forward to a house; they are looking forward to a plan that the various local authorities will introduce. When the plan is concocted, they will be told that is the resolution of their problem. Maybe in two, three or four years they will get houses. People cannot live in a plan, at least not as far as I know. The Minister has failed to bring affordable houses within the reach of people and to provide rental accommodation. On the latter issue, in parts of the country, including my constituency, people pay £100 per week with up to ten people occupying a house. What is going on? Is the Department aware of it?</P>
      <P>I suggest an honest and fair response to the situation. The Minister of State should ask his senior Minister what he has been doing. Why has he done nothing about this? He must accept some responsibility. He cannot walk away. We owe something to the people. The Minister and the Minister of State must get off their tails and do something about it. They have talked long enough. They have a multiplicity of plans but no action. The only thing they have accorded people on housing lists is the benefit and privilege, as in every other Department, of joining a waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's housing policy has proved to be counterproductive. I draw attention to local authority housing which is causing widespread misery. People on local authority waiting lists are forced to endure serious stress and it creates difficult friction in families. Housing lists have exploded. In many cases the numbers waiting have doubled. The Government's policy forces people, who prior to this could purchase a house, to depend on local authorities for their needs. In County Limerick, 1,360 people are on the waiting list and they are deemed to be entitled to a house. As a public representative, it is frustrating to advise applicants of the situation. How can one respond to people in need of hous<Col N="1379" /> ing who have been on a waiting list for many years? It is unfair that such vulnerable people are being ignored.</P>
      <P>In County Limerick, 400 families await houses. There are many pressures on families today and family breakdown levels are at their highest rate in the State's history. There is agreement across the board that the State should recognise the crisis in families and give assistance to ensure that the traditional family remains the bedrock of society. Comparing the Government's aspiration to its approach to vulnerable families makes one doubt its commitment to the family. A basic need for a family is a house. The Government has failed families who must live in overcrowded conditions, live with parents often in one room, in unacceptable conditions, rat infested rented dwellings or damp houses which are a health hazard, in mobile homes or caravans. This is a disgrace and I cannot emphasise strongly enough the misery, pressure and despair of such families.</P>
      <P>Limerick County Council has 960 people on a waiting list for small houses, made up of single parents and senior citizens. In most, but not all cases, single parents are young vulnerable women who require every assistance to meet their situation and to assist them in rearing children. Last year there were 17,735 births outside of marriage. In 1999, there were 16,461 and in 1998 there were 15,492, an increase every year. The number of marriages per 100,000 has dropped from 704 in 1970 to 506 in 2000. The Government has a duty to introduce policies to cater for the needs of single parents. I raised this issue over ten years as I recognise, from those who call to me, that this is a vulnerable group with special needs. The Government must recognise the special housing needs and provide special funding for single parents and their children who are on the waiting list. The stress and pressure of single parents trying to survive on lone parent's allowance is exacerbated by their not having their own accommodation. Many live with their parents which causes stress for both families resulting in a breakdown in relationships. Many must live in substandard conditions. People on social welfare, even with health board support, cannot afford decent rental accommodation. They are the group most exploited by unscrupulous landlords. Not all are guilty, but too many landlords abuse the single parents' vulnerability by charging very high rents for substandard accommodation. The Government, in its housing policy, treats single parents unjustly and has failed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Limerick County Council has more than 450 senior citizens on the waiting list for small houses. Those who spent their lives working to build the State, in their retirement years deserve better than to be forced to wait for most of their declining years for decent accommodation. The Government professes to honour and recognise the contribution of our citizens. It gave medical cards to all people over 70 years regardless of wealth and housing conditions. At 70 years with <Col N="1380" /> a mansion worth £1 million, a person is entitled to a medical card while too many dependent on their pensions, who ought to be entitled to a medical card on the basis of income, will not have decent accommodation or a house in which to end their days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear the Government's housing policy has failed. It has resulted in a major fall-off in private house construction. As Deputy Farrelly stated, unless there are major alterations in the budget, many construction workers will go on Christmas holidays not to come back. Look at local authority housing waiting lists. In Galway City, there are more than 1,000 on the list and a similar number in the county. The waiting time is more than four and half years for both but worse in some situations. People arriving at the office counter are told that they have five years to wait and so do not fill in applications, at a booming time in the economy when the Government squandered the opportunity to solve the housing crisis.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the red tape in Galway city and county in regard to housing repairs for which local authority tenants sometimes wait for years. Workers do some of the work before going away for months or even years. The tenants must contact me or someone else to get the workers to return. The repair grants situation is a shambles, as I have brought to the Minister's attention before, but he has done nothing about it. There are local authority schemes such as the essential repairs scheme, the disabled person's grant, improvement in lavatories grants and health board schemes for the elderly. The delay in carrying out works under such schemes is a scandal. First, with regard to repairs for the elderly, the house is examined and if it is put on a priority one list, work might be done in a year or year and a half. If the job is listed on the priority two list, it is four or five years before the work is done. There is duplication of inspections and red tape between the health board and the council as applicants often apply to both in their anxiety to get a grant. As I said to the Minister before, let one authority deal with this.</P>
      <P>The disabled person's grant is one for a bathroom or downstairs bedroom for use by a disabled person. I dealt with a woman caring for her husband, whose health was seriously deteriorating. She had applied for a grant for a downstairs bedroom and a shower. A year later he had to sleep on a couch downstairs while she slept on the floor. The poor man died before the grant was sanctioned. Is that the way for the Minister to treat people in his own city? He ought to give the necessary staff to the local authorities, which they say is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people are forced on the rent supplement scheme because of the housing situation, on which more than £100 million is spent nationally, £11.2 million in the Western Health Board area last year. Many people on rent supplements are good tenants but many cause hell <Col N="1381" /> for their neighbours. They keep dogs in the back garden. They sleep all day and make noise all night while children are trying to study. The health board can do nothing. If they were in local authority housing, they could be convicted for anti-social behaviour. Some of those people are getting 95% rent subsidy from the health board but the health boards can do nothing about them. I ask the Minister to bring in the same rules for those people as those that apply to local authority houses who have to abide by social behavioural norms. The Minister must get the staff into the local authorities to deal with the backlog of housing repairs and house applications.</P>

      <P>The Government has taken a wide range of measures, each reinforcing and complementing the others, to reduce house price inflation, increase housing output to match demand, remove infrastructural and planning constraints on residential development, afford greater access to the housing market to first time buyers and improve affordability for first time buyers and lower income households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's publication, Action on House Prices, in April 1998, was the first of three major policy initiatives on housing. Its primary focus was to increase housing supply through a range of infrastructural and tax measures and to prevent investors pricing first time buyers out of <Col N="1382" /> the market. First time buyers &ndash; Fine Gael does not seem to care a damn about them.</P>

      <P>Let me remind Fine Gael about some of the key measures taken by the Government. A range of tax measures, including adjustments to the stamp duty system, were introduced to bring forward the supply of development land, remove speculators from the market and improve affordability for first time purchasers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On top of significantly increased investment generally in water, sewerage and roads services, we introduced targeted measures to increase the supply of serviced residential land. Over £50 million of Exchequer funding is being spent on the serviced land initiative which will provide water and sewerage services for 165,000 housing units. An additional £195 million of Exchequer funding has also been provided to part-fund the construction of 42 non-national roads which will provide services for over 42,000 housing units. Six project offices have been established to drive key infrastructure projects necessary to support housing development. We designated the first three sites, comprising 14,000 housing units, in June of this year as strategic development zones for residential development to ensure the early development of these sites.</P>
      <P>We published planning guidelines on residential density in September 1999 which are helping to secure efficient use of serviced development land, facilitate provision of more affordable housing and promote sustainable development. Strategic planning guidelines are being drawn up on a regional basis for the Dublin and mid-east regions and this is being replicated in other key regions throughout the country.</P>

      <P>We are on target this year to achieve the second highest level of housing output on record. Since house price inflation peaked in 1998, primarily as a result of the failed policies of the last Rainbow Government, there has been a downward trend in house price increases. My Department's quarter data for June of this year showed a continued moderation in new house prices with the annual rate of increase at 12.2% nationally and 10.9% in Dublin and second hand house price increases of 12% and 12.4%, respectively. The 12% annual increase nationally for second hand houses was the lowest recorded since the first quarter of 1996, when the Rainbow Coalition was in Government. These data are supported by other sources. According to the Irish Permanent, September 2001 figures show that for the ninth consecutive month the year-on-year growth in national house prices has slowed, falling from 12.8% in August to 12.1% in September. This is the lowest year-on-year increase since the index started.</P>

First time purchasers are now accounting for a larger share of the market, with applications for new house grants up 6.3% in the first nine months of this year following an increase of 4.8% last year. Indicative figures also show that first time purchasers accounted for 38% of the market in the first half of 2000. This has risen to 44% for the first half of this year. So, Fine Gael would have us reverse our policies which have achieved increased output, reduced house price increases and a greater share of the market for first time buyers.</P>

This Government can also claim credit for bringing about real and positive changes in the provision of social and affordable housing. We have for the first time provided a long-term framework for the funding of social and affordable housing through the inclusion of £6 billion in the national development plan earmarked for these purposes. The £6 billion in the plan was supplemented by the commitment by Government of a further £1 billion for social and affordable housing in action on housing.</P>
      <P>Action on Housing also included a number of measures to address social and affordable housing needs, including an increase of 6,000 units in the number of local authority housing starts under the NDP, increases in the income limits for the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes and a new site subsidy for houses provided by local authorities under these schemes. This overall investment will ensure that the housing needs of over 90,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the period of the plan.</P>

      <P>The multi-annual approach was introduced to allow for greater forward planning and efficiencies of scale in delivering the increased local authority housing targets. Effectively, we have given <i>carte blanche</i> to local authorities to start as many projects as they possibly can. They are now building houses at a rate we have not seen for many years and I expect that local authorities will complete at least 5,000 units this year and that commencements of new house starts will exceed 7,000 units. This will be highest level of starts for more than 15 years and is an indication of how local authorities have successfully accelerated their programmes to meet existing demand. The Government has effected a major sea change in the local authority housing programme, not only by ramping up output, but also by improving standards. The quality of local authority housing being provided is of a very high standard and compares favourably with private housing design standards.</P>

      <P>Major regeneration programmes have also commenced in Dublin and Cork in addition to the main local authority housing programme, most notably the redevelopment of Ballymun in Dublin, the biggest regeneration project in the State. More than 500 new houses are under construction in Ballymun. A major milestone in the Ballymun redevelopment was achieved earlier this month when the first completed houses were handed over to the new tenants. Over the next few months it is expected that a further 200 houses will be completed and occupied by tenants moving from their existing high rise flats to low conventional housing.</P>

      <P>More than 200 new houses are under construction in six projects in the inner city.</P>
      <P>Work is also due to start early next year on the first phase of the £40 million redevelopment of the Glen area in Cork city. This phase will involve the construction of 48 new dwellings and the refurbishment of 66 existing dwellings. These measures are additional to the main construction programme and represent new and additional social housing activity.</P>
      <P>My Department is also jointly funding with Dublin Corporation a once-off upgrading of high density older housing complexes, mainly flats, at various locations around the city at an estimated cost of £85 million. Work on this programme has been progressing well since 1997 with the result that new windows have been installed in more than 2,000 dwellings, central heating installed in 8,000 dwellings and roof replacement completed on 12 major flat complexes.</P>
      <P>On coming into office the Government very quickly identified the important contribution which the voluntary and co-operative housing sector has to make in tackling the growing demand for social housing. The Government's commitment to developing and expanding the sector and giving it the necessary resources and support to enable it to become an important and significant force in the housing area is reflected in the national development plan, which includes ambitious targets for output by the sector for each year of the plan and provides the necessary funding to achieve these targets.</P>
      <P>The commitment of the Government to the expansion of the sector is also reflected in the improvement to the terms of the voluntary housing funding schemes on four occasions since 1997, the most recent in July this year. When I took office the sector was collapsing and funding had not been increased for several years. The improved terms for these schemes are clearly having a very positive effect on activity.</P>

      <P>Output by the sector in 2000 showed a substantial increase in the number of units of accommodation provided, with some 950 units completed, the highest output by the sector since 1995. The indications are that output by the sector this year will be in line with the NDP target of 1,250 units. There has been a marked increase in the number of units of accommodation under construction and at various stages in the pipeline at the end of the first half of this year as compared with the same time last year. I have approved £158 million in assistance towards voluntary house building programmes in the year to date compared to £119 million for 2000. These indicators augur well for continued growth in the sector.</P>
      <P>Housing output from the local authority housing programme together with output from the complementary social housing programmes of voluntary, affordable and shared ownership housing with vacancies occurring in the existing local authority housing stock will enable the housing needs of approximately 11,000 households to be met this year.</P>

      <P>On the issue of homelessness, I launched the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness in May 2000. The strategy recognises for the first time that homelessness is not just about a lack of accommodation, but that the health, care, welfare, education and training needs of homeless persons need to be addressed in a co-ordinated manner if the problem of homelessness is to be tackled effectively. The Government's strategy has been welcomed by both the statutory and voluntary sectors as providing, for the first time, an integrated response to homelessness at both national and local level.</P>
      <P>A key element of the strategy is that homeless action plans are to be drawn up at local level jointly by the local authority, health board and voluntary bodies, to chart clearly what services exist for homeless persons and outline what services need to be provided for them over the next three years. The plans for the main urban areas are already completed and work is well under way on the plans for other areas and should be completed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has made substantial additional funding available to ensure the recommendations in the homeless strategy are implemented. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the next five years and current funding has already been increased by £6 million per annum to increase bed night contribution rates to voluntary bodies and fund other support services such as settlement and outreach services. Some of these services were starved by the previous Fine Gael-led coalition. Additional funding of £6 million is also available from the Department of Health and Children to fund the <Col N="1388" /> provision of in-house care in hostels providing accommodation for homeless people.</P>
    <P>There is already firm evidence that there have been considerable improvements in services for homeless persons. For example, current funding to many voluntary bodies which provide accommodation and related services for homeless persons has been significantly increased in line with recommendations in the homeless strategy. Settlement and outreach services have been developed in some areas to work with homeless persons and assist them into suitable long-term accommodation. Additional accommodation, particularly transitional and long-term accommodation, has already come on stream at various locations throughout the country and more will become available next year and in future years.</P>
    <P>As part of the overall homeless strategy, the Government gave a commitment to prepare a preventative strategy to tackle key groups at risk of homelessness which I will be in a position to publish very shortly. The main theme throughout the strategy will be the need to ensure no one is released from any type of State care, whether custodial or health related, without appropriate measures being in place to ensure they have a suitable place to live with the necessary supports, if needed.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael motion completely fails to acknowledge one of the most fundamental changes to Irish planning law introduced by any Government contained in the Planning and Development Act, 2000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government recognises the importance of, and need for, a diverse and well managed private rented sector, something which Fine Gael forgot about when it was in government. We established <Col N="1389" /> the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector to examine the issues of security of tenure, supply and development constraints and the balance of rights and responsibilities between landlords and tenants in July 1999.</P>

The commission reported to me in July 2000 and Government proposals for reform of the sector arising from the recommendations contained in the commission's report were announced in January 2001.</P>
      <P>A number of relevant measures have already been implemented in the Finance Act, 2001, including a reduction in the stamp duty rate for new residential investment properties, tax relief on rental income in respect of refurbishment capital expenditure, the reintroduction of interest relief on borrowings in the case of certain properties meeting specified conditions&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>A new rent-a-room scheme was introduced in this year's Finance Act which provides for an exemption from income tax where gross rental income does not exceed £6,000 per annum, for accommodation provided in a person's principal private residence. The scheme will increase the availability of accommodation, will assist affordability for house purchasers and will also make better utilisation of the housing stock. In addition, the ceilings for income tax relief in respect of rents paid by tenants in the private rented sector have doubled over the last two budgets.</P>
      <P>Regarding the rent supplement scheme, there are a number of key facts that the Opposition needs to understand. This scheme forms an integral part of the social welfare system and provides necessary income support for over 42,000 households renting privately whose means are insufficient to meet the rental costs. This Government has made significant improvements to the scheme. For example, we have taken action to address employment disincentives by extending and increasing entitlement to retain rent supplement for people on special back to work schemes. There are around 5,000 people claiming rent supplement on this basis. We went a step further last year by allowing long-term unemployed to retain rent supplement on a tapering basis without having to go through a special employment programme.</P>
      <P>These and other improvements cost money of course, but I challenge the Opposition to show that spending to reduce unemployment traps and other anomalies is not justified. Do they also think it wrong that we are now disregarding the first £5 of pension increases in calculating rent supplements? Are we wrong to disregard the first £25 of income from part time work and training allowances? Was the decision to increase by £10 per week the amount of rent supplement payable to voluntary housing tenants under the capital assistance scheme excessive? Fine Gael seems to think so.</P>
      <P>A second key factor affecting rent supplement costs is that the scheme is now providing assistance for over 5,000 asylum seekers, a factor that was largely absent during the Opposition's last sojourn in government. I will assume that even they would not suggest withdrawing this essential support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to see them working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The third main factor influencing rent supplement costs is the trend in market <Col N="1391" /> rents. As is the case with every other segment of the housing market, the private rented sector has come under considerable pressure from the scale of economic growth and demographic change in recent years. The rent supplement scheme cannot be insulated from the effects of this. Its whole purpose is to provide necessary support for people renting in the private market. Consequently, rent increases have exerted strong upward pressure on rent supplement costs. This can only be addressed by promoting general rent moderation through increased supply of rental accommodation. The measures we took in the last Finance Act, and which I have already outlined, should have a positive effect on supply of rental accommodation. We are also looking at how the structure of the rental assistance scheme can be improved. There needs to be support for tenants who cannot afford reasonable rental costs. However, any scheme that consists purely of providing subsidy which goes into the market without reference to overall supply is potentially inflationary. We signalled in our Action on Housing policy statement last year that more supply based approaches to rental assistance would be explored. Proposals in that regard will be outlined in a forthcoming report by a planning group that is examining the role of local authorities in this area.</P>
      <P>I would envisage local authorities playing an important role in securing availability of good standard rental accommodation on a long-term basis for households in need of assistance and promoting the development of new accommodation for such households in partnership with the private sector. In addition to availability of accommodation, this approach can help to ensure proper standards of accommodation and promote rent moderation, security of tenure and greater stability for households depending on rent assistance.</P>
      <P>Administration of the rent supplement scheme has improved significantly in recent years, particularly with completion of a comprehensive information technology system in 1999 that integrates it with the overall social welfare system. Further significant improvements in both the structure and administration of rental assistance will be pursued following the forthcoming planning group report. The focus of reform in this area must be on ensuring that needs are met as effectively as possible with adequate supply of good standard accommodation at reasonable cost, not on simplistic approaches or bureaucratic issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The freedom to quote figures without regard to the underlying realties is one of the luxuries of sitting on the Opposition side of the House. In this case, a bit more homework would have been advisable. Despite the wider eligibility and improved entitlements that we have introduced and notwithstanding the added pressures in the housing market, the rate of increase in rent supplement expenditure under this Government is less than the equivalent figure during the Rain<Col N="1392" /> bow period when we were led by Fine Gael. Perhaps the Deputies should have another look at the terms of the motion.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to overall housing needs is credible, it is comprehensive, it is well funded and crucially it is working&mdash;</P>

      <P>With the agreement of the House I wish to share my time with Deputy Moynihan-Cronin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech reminded me of the song of the bumble bee &ndash; full of activity and utterly <Col N="1393" /> pointless. He referred to what he called underlying realities. I would like to draw his attention to these underlying realities. If he and his Government profess to have been so active on the issue of housing over the last four and a half years, why do we have the underlying reality that it is now impossible for young working couples to buy a home of their own; that it is more expensive to rent accommodation than to pay a mortgage on it; that we have the highest number of applicants on local authority waiting lists in the history of the State and that in the lifetime of this Government the number of people who are homeless in our country has doubled?</P>
    <P>Those are the underlying realities after four and a half years of this Government. Last Tuesday at Question Time I asked the Minister to change Government housing policy, considering the continuing inability of families to purchase a home of their own; the low number of local authority houses currently being constructed and the general downturn in housing construction activity. The reply from the Minister on that occasion was typical of his response to the housing crisis over the past four and a half years and was similar to the response he has given us tonight. Essentially, there is no problem, everything is under control, things are getting better and the Government is doing what it can.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to speak on Deputy Mitchell's motion which is essentially calling for a change in Government housing policy. What is Government housing policy anyway? When this Government took office it pinned its housing policy on the concept of home ownership. When this Government is finally driven from office it will be remembered as a Government which put home ownership beyond the reach of those who could traditionally afford it &ndash; young working couples. At the end of this Government's term of office, two young teachers in their mid to late twenties, setting up home together, cannot afford to buy from their own resources of two salaries the kind of starter home which their parents could buy 30 years ago on one salary.</P>
    <P>When the Government took office in mid-1997 the average price of a new house was £73,523. Today it is £147,892, an increase of over 100%. In mid-1997 it was possible to rent a family sized house or apartment in the city for approximately £450 a month. The same accommodation today costs approximately £1,000 a month, an increase of over 100%. In mid-1997 some 26,000 families were seeking local authority housing. Today the figure is closer to 60,000. Every housing affordability indicator has doubled under the Government. House prices, rents, the number on council housing waiting lists and the number of homeless people on our streets have doubled.</P>
    <P>All this has happened during the four and a half years of the State's greatest wealth. Previous Governments, during the country's worst economic times, were able to house our people, yet this Government, with no shortage of financial resources, has failed to satisfy the housing needs <Col N="1394" /> of our population. This is not just a matter of poor economic performance or a social policy failure. It is a human and personal problem. I will tell the House about some of the people I met yesterday at my constituency advice centre. To protect confidentiality I will not use their real names.</P>
    <P>Mary has two children. Some 14 months ago she was evicted from the flat she had rented for four years. She has been homeless since then, getting overnight accommodation in a bed and breakfast and walking the streets with her two children every day. She told me yesterday that she does not want to be homeless for a second Christmas in succession. She told me that some of last year's Christmas presents for the children are in a black bag in her sister's house because the children cannot play with them in the bed and breakfast. Last week her doctor put her on antidepressants. It is the first time in her life that she has been prescribed such medicine.</P>
    <P>Nora has one child who is ten years old. They were evicted from their private flat in September and are finding it very difficult to manage in the bed and breakfast accommodation issued to them by the homeless persons unit. The ten year old attends a local primary school, but has been off school for the past week because he is sick. The doctor put him on an antibiotic, but unlike any other child off school with the flu, he cannot go home to bed. He must spend the day walking the town with his mother.</P>
    <P>Michael and Celine and their two children, aged ten and 14 years, were evicted from the house they rented last February. They told me about the difficulties the children face doing their homework in bed and breakfast accommodation and the embarrassment the children feel among their friends about their living circumstances.</P>

      <P>These are just some of the examples of the human misery and suffering which are a direct result of the Government's housing policy. The daily experience of 1,000 homeless children and their families in Dublin city alone is the same as I have described it for those three families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 60,000 families are on council housing waiting lists and becoming increasingly desperate about their prospects of being housed. Some are living in expensive or unsuitable private rented accommodation. Some are living in overcrowded and uncomfortable conditions with families or in-laws. The couple and two children sharing a box room in an overcrowded house are the legacy of four and a half years of this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government. Marriages and relationships are falling apart. The health of many housing applicants is deteriorating. The education and personal development of children being reared in such circumstances are suffering. The country will pay for the Government's neg<Col N="1395" /> lect of housing for decades in its health, education and social welfare budgets.</P>
    <P>Judged either by results or the efficacy of individual initiatives the Government's efforts on housing have been a succession of failures. At first the Government appeared to regard the housing crisis as a market problem &ndash; indeed, it appeared to welcome it. If land speculators and sections of the building industry were making a killing, why would Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats not be happy? Demand had increased and if housing supply could be increased, prices would stabilise. This was the conventional market theory.</P>
    <P>Supply increased from 34,000 units in 1996 to almost 50,000 units last year, but prices continued to go up. Not only did increased house supply not succeed in calming prices, particularly at starter level, but housing supply now appears to be falling. For some time the Irish Home Builders Association has been drawing attention to the decline in homebond registrations and planning applications for residential development, pointing out that this inevitably means a downturn in housing supply. The recent pre-budget submission prepared by DKM economic consultants for the Irish Home Builders Association predicts that private house completions will fall by about 10% this year and that the total number of private completions is forecast to decline in 2001 for the first time since 1993. The prognosis for the longer term is not much better. The Irish Home Builders Association is predicting a fall in private completions of a further 15% in 2002, based on, among other matters, the fall in planning decisions, which are down 7% in the first six months of 2001, and the fall in planning applications, which are down 9% in the same period.</P>
    <P>The Government does not appear to have succeeded in any aspect of its housing policy. Prices have doubled and the supply on which the Government had pinned so much hope is now beginning to fall. The serviced land initiative, introduced following the first Bacon report to subsidise building sites, will have produced only about half the number of projected sites by the end of this year. The 20% provision in the Planning and Development Act has yet to deliver a single house and will not do so for about another two years.</P>

      <P>However, the Government's biggest failure on housing has been in the two areas over which it has had direct control for the past four and a half years, that is, the provision of social housing and the regulation of the private rented sector. In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which the Government negotiated with the social partners, there is a commitment to provide 25,000 social housing units over a four <Col N="1396" /> year period, 2000 to 2003. Against a background of 60,000 applicants on local authority housing lists this target was too low in the first place. However, it is now becoming painfully clear that even the modest housing target set and agreed in the PPF will not be reached.</P>
      <P>In reply to a parliamentary question last week the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, told the House that 3,207 social housing units were provided last year, that the expected output would be approximately 5,000 this year and that there would be a similar level of output in 2002. The Minister of State's most optimistic expectation is that only half the houses promised in the PPF will have been delivered as we enter the last of those four years.</P>
      <P>In the private rented sector the Government has turned its back on the country's 150,000 tenants. Pushed by the Opposition and organisations such as Threshold the Government established a commission on the private rented sector, which reported in July 2000. It took the Minister over six months to give his response to the commission in January this year. So far he has failed to produce the legislation promised to give basic rights to tenants. When he announced his decisions in January he undertook to establish the Private Rented Tenancies Board on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in the autumn. All he has done so far is announce the membership of the board. He again confirmed last week in the House that the board will not hear its first case from either a landlord or a tenant in respect of a dispute until some time next year. God knows when he will introduce the legislation necessary to underpin the workings of the board, give it statutory effect and provide some regulation in the private rented sector.</P>
      <P>The Government has pursued housing policy which has given us the worst of all worlds. Young working people cannot afford to buy and can afford even less to rent. Those on council waiting lists face unprecedented waiting periods. The Government's policy has produced the most remarkable of all outcomes in that it has resulted in what appears to be the beginnings of a collapse in housing construction. In a scenario where house prices have increased, where rents are so high and where the Government has failed to provide the necessary regulation in the private rented sector, how has it managed to bring about a set of circumstances which are resulting in a downturn in housing construction? We are facing into the turn of the year with the prospect of substantial lay-offs in the residential construction sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is past time the Government acknowledged defeat. After four and a half years it has failed in the crucial area of housing and must change its housing policies. If it does not do so in recognition of its failure in this area, there must be a change of Government in order that policies may be introduced which will provide housing and shelter for Irish people and reverse the scandalous situation which pertains. I have described the circumstances in which people on council housing <Col N="1397" /> waiting lists find themselves and could equally describe the difficulties experienced by those who must drive 20, 30 or 40 miles from their place of work in order to be able to afford to buy a home. This presents other difficulties and hardships in terms of time spent travelling, child care, distance from families and anti-social hours etc. Government housing policy must change if we are to provide some relief for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed to hear the Minister of State reading out the usual litany of so-called initiatives, reports and allocations. None of these has worked. Given the miserable results on housing produced after four and a half years of the Government's time in office, there is something fundamentally wrong with the policies it has pursued.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Deputy Gilmore referred to the difficulties experienced by those on housing waiting lists. The same difficulties are experienced by people in towns and villages throughout Ireland. The housing lists are increasing and people cannot even put a roof over their heads. One of the acid tests of any society is its willingness and ability to provide housing for its people. People have a fundamental right to have a roof over their heads. This should not merely be the test of a booming economy; it should be its hallmark. Sadly, this is not the case in our economy because the Government has created a market economy rather than a social economy. Ideologically driven by Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat right wingers, the current Administration has no interest whatsoever in providing our people with the requirements essential to live a comfortable and secure life. The Government's epitaph may well include its gross negligence in regard to housing provisions as one of its total failures. After four and a half years in office housing continues to epitomise the Government's incoherent approach to public policy.</P>
      <P>As a representative of a constituency which has borne much of the Government's failure on housing, I want to give some facts. There are currently more than 700 people on the waiting lists in south Kerry, the majority located in Killarney. These numbers are unprecedented and growing on a daily basis. The numbers on the waiting lists are qualified applicants, but local authority housing officers point out that some people in employment and above the qualifying threshold for the housing lists cannot afford to buy houses of their own. These people, who are in limbo, should also be on the lists. The real figures, therefore, are much higher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State must be proud of these statistics if the attitude he and his colleagues have displayed over the past four and a half years is anything to go by. Site and house prices in Killarney, Kenmare, Dingle and other parts of south Kerry are now so expensive that they are out of the reach of any average couple. Why has no <Col N="1398" /> effort been made to curb these prices or provide additional housing? As the demand for housing in the private sector slows, the capacity of the construction industry should now be used by the Government to increase the scale of its response to social housing needs. The average rent currently paid by my constituents is an outrageous £100 per week, in many cases for sub-standard accommodation. The amount of rent allowance paid by the Southern Health Board has rapidly escalated in recent years, not least because the Government has presided over a widening gap between rich and poor.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister is not present because I want to raise the case of a 50 year old widow in my constituency who has no living relatives. There is grass growing in the windows of her front room. I am going on my hands and knees to the county manager, the health board or anyone else who may be able to assist her. She needs a couple of thousand pounds to get proper windows but cannot get a disabled person's grant because she is not disabled and too young to qualify for an essential repairs grant. This woman will have grass in her sitting room for Christmas. This is the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what figures the Minister of State trots out, they cannot hide the fact that the housing problem is more serious than ever. The Labour Party in government has a proud record of house building. If one looks at any of the Governments in which it served, the facts are there for all to see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to discuss the matter of Scoil Íde, Curranes national school, in Castleisland, County Kerry. The school was constructed in 1962 but there has been no further extension to its two classrooms since then.</P>
      <P>In January 1984, a third teacher commenced work in the school, but she had to teach her 28 pupils in a converted hallway and cloakroom. She taught in these cramped surroundings until October 1988 when a prefab was provided by the Department. Three classes are now using the dilapidated, 14 year old prefab which is small, damp and a health hazard. Mould is cleared from its walls and ceilings on a regular basis. There are continual problems with head lice as a result of the close proximity of the children. The prefabricated classroom, which measures about 7 m x 5 m, houses 25 students. There are only two toilets in the prefab and the area used for hanging coats measures only 2 m x 2.22 m. The roof of the prefab has been repaired twice and the disintegrating floor timbers have also been replaced on two occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> The school is located on an exposed site and is open to the elements. The lack of insulation in the prefab causes extreme temperature variations, from very hot and humid in summer to cold and miserable in winter. This means that the children are exposed to infections of all kinds, including colds, influenza and bronchitis. The teacher working in these conditions spent five years working in the corridor of the existing school. Her working conditions are unsatisfactory and demoralising and her foot has broken through the rotten floorboards on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>The school's water supply has been found to be unsafe for human consumption as it contains high levels of bacteria and iron, among other problems. It is brown and apart from its ugly and disgusting appearance, it is discolouring the toilets and other sanitary facilities. Pupils and staff have no available drinking water. A remedial teacher and a resource teacher who work with a special needs child in the school have to use a room no bigger than a cupboard. Pupil numbers have increased due to the large number of houses being constructed within the school's catchment area. The numbers look set to increase further in the next three to five years, especially as the school has a good reputation due to its excellent teachers.</P>
    <P>A child who has had a bone marrow transplant is due to commence in Scoil Íde next year. The child is susceptible to infections and needs a clean and safe environment, so the conditions in the school at present are unsuitable. I would like to quote from a letter a group of parents from the school sent to me recently:</P>
    <P>The parents of Scoil Íde feel very strongly and intend to fight for the right of our children to have a safe, hygienic, pleasant environment to work in. We hope you will join with us and use your influence to help us at this critical time and hope to hear from you in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>They asked me to appeal to the Minister for Education and Science on their behalf so that the extension that has been planned for the school since 1984 can be provided. I understand that the extension is in the advanced stages of planning and should be included in next year's capital programme. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to speak to his senior colleague to ensure it is included.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will visit County Kerry next Thursday week. I publicly appeal to him to visit the school to see for himself the conditions in which the children of Scoil Íde have to pursue their education. The facilities are unacceptable in this day and age. The teachers and parents have grown increasingly frustrated. There is no excuse for allowing the prefab to be retained in such a dilapidated condition, with the problems I have outlined. There is no apparent effort from the Department and the building unit to having the <Col N="1400" /> prefab replaced. I conclude by appealing to the Minister of State to include Corranes national school, County Kerry, in the schools building programme for 2002.</P>

      <P>The school staff consists of a principal, two mainstream classroom teachers and a shared remedial teacher. The enrolment on 30 September 2001 was 70 pupils. The school's present facilities consist of two permanent classrooms and a prefab. The Department has received an application for grant aid towards the cost of upgrading the facilities and architectural planning has commenced. The Deputy will appreciate that the Government has allocated massive and unprecedented increases in funds for the schools building programme. Decisions on the rate of progress of the construction of projects, including that at Curranes national school, will be taken in the light of the allocations to be made for school buildings purposes at the conclusion of the forthcoming budgetary Estimates.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment tonight the plight of Aghina national school and the 26 pupils who are enrolled there, along with the concerns of the teachers, parents and the board of management.</P>
      <P>If there was ever a case to prove the need for reform of the Department of Education and Science, it is the case of Aghina national school. The school authorities have pursued improved conditions at the school since 1995. It is located about three miles from Macroom and has a long tradition of providing excellent education in circumstances that are now very difficult. It is likely that a full stream of students will have gone through the school before the key is turned on a new school building there. It is now 2001 and with the best intentions in the world, I suspect it will be more than the Department can do to have a new school in place before next September. I take it that there will not be a new school before September 2003, which will mean that eight years will have passed since parents started their campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cromien report and a report from Deloitte and Touche, both of which deal with the need to reform radically the way in which the Department of Education and Science is administered, are sitting in the Minister's office. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, may tell us that spending on capital projects has increased significantly <Col N="1401" /> under this Administration but that is not worth a tráithnín to the parents of pupils at Aghina national school. They will not care how much has been spent nationally until their children are in better classrooms. I accept there has been an increase in budgetary allocations but it is not enough. The way in which business is conducted in the Department of Education and Science means that projects make snail like progress and the taxpayer does not receive value for money. It is about time this issue was taken by the scruff of the neck and the whole procedure reformed so that buildings can be built at primary and secondary levels at a faster rate to ensure full streams of pupils do not go through the system before improvements are made.</P>
    <P>Aghina national school accommodates 26 pupils in two classrooms. By any yardstick, the teachers face almost inhuman conditions as they try to teach pupils. Fumes enter classrooms from the boiler house, the plumbing is entirely inadequate, there is no proper ventilation which makes it difficult for students to concentrate and study, the wiring is substandard and dangerous, there are not enough electrical sockets in the rooms and the toilet facilities are completely inadequate. A pupil with a disability who uses a wheelchair will be enrolled in the school next September, meaning that an already difficult situation will be exacerbated. Floor tiles are missing and broken, there is no toilet for disabled persons and dampness is a major problem. There is neither a fire door nor a fire escape, nor is there a smoke or burglar alarm. There is no security lighting, principal's office, staff room, secretary's office nor is there a remedial room to cater for the learning support teacher appointed to the school and shared with seven other primary schools. There is overcrowding in both existing classrooms. There is no bus turning bay for the bus delivering children to the school. There are no staff or pupil lockers and there is insufficient storage space. The yard and outdoor facilities are sub-standard, the roof is sub-standard and the septic tank is sub-standard.</P>
    <P>It will be an abuse of parliamentary procedure if this Minister reads out a reply that does not make reference to what is happening in this school as he did in the previous case and as the Minister for Education and Science has done with every question put to him about school building projects. If that happens tonight I will take the matter up with the Ceann Comhairle and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for abuse of Members in not replying to queries that have specific detail in them.</P>

The school's present facilities consist of two permanent classrooms. My Department has recently acquired a site for the provision of a new school building.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including this particular project, will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes at the conclusion of the forthcoming budgetary process.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter tonight.</P>
      <P>Everybody accepts that the intent of this scheme is excellent. It proposes to arrange for minor alterations and repairs to the homes of the elderly to ensure that their houses last longer and that they have reasonable comfort in their later years. The intention is excellent but unfortunately the scheme is a total shambles.</P>
      <P>It is a cruel farce being perpetrated on old and vulnerable people. Many applicants are traumatised by long delays, refusals or worst of all by being left in limbo and hearing nothing about the status of their application. This scheme was trumpeted by Government as the be all and end all of schemes. It was to deal with urgent housing defects, such as leaking roofs, rotting windows and doors, dangerous wiring, proper sanitary facilities and heating. It is under-resourced, underfunded and understaffed.</P>
      <P>In south Tipperary the allocation for this year was £237,500 for the scheme and no staff was provided for the health board to operate the scheme. Furthermore, £100,000 of that money was committed for last year's applications. That meant that of the 450 applications received this year only 150 have been assessed. Two-thirds of this year's applications, 300 applications, have not been assessed nor have the applicants been visited. Elderly people are just lost when it comes to the operation of this scheme.</P>
      <P>An applicant with whom I am dealing is 75 years of age and has only an outdoor toilet. This applicant applied seven months ago to have an internal room altered to provide an indoor toilet and bathroom facility. He has not even been visited yet; his case is not unique. That is how things stand for the 300 applications received by the health board in south Tipperary this year. One type of improvement applicants are waiting for is heating. Since in the region of 2,000 people die annually for want of proper heating one would think heating for the elderly would be a priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is totally underfunded and there is <Col N="1403" /> no staff available to health boards to operate the scheme. In south Tipperary alone I estimate that a reasonable provision to have work carried out for the applicants who have applied would be £1 million. That is a small amount for the benefits that would accrue to the elderly and to the health boards as it would ensure that the elderly could live at home in reasonably comfortable conditions in their later years.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to fund and staff the scheme properly. This year there has been no additional allocation under the scheme. In previous years an allocation was made in late October or early November. That has not happened this year. The additional allocation was small, it was about £25,000 in south Tipperary last year, but this year not even that amount has been allocated. I ask the Minister to consider making a further allocation immediately to the various health boards and to ensure that in the forthcoming budget a reasonable allocation will be made to the health boards to meet the number of applications received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise for the absence of the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, who cannot be here tonight.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Healy for having raised this matter and I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak about the special housing aid for the elderly scheme and the funding provided. I will not refer to the question of staff as this matter is more appropriate to the health boards and the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>The scheme is administered by a task force which was set up in 1982 under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to undertake an emergency programme to improve the housing conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit or unsanitary accommodation. In the interests of elderly persons whose housing conditions are improved under the scheme, it has, since its inception, been administered with flexibility and a minimum of formality. However, over the years health boards have evolved a priority list to ensure that the most urgent cases are dealt with as quickly as possible within the terms of the guidelines. Typically, aid is available for necessary repairs to make a dwelling habitable for the lifetime of the occupant. In 2000 the scheme was extended to include the provision of suitable heating systems, where necessary, to meet the needs of elderly persons.</P>
      <P>The community care departments of the health boards operate the scheme using various mechanisms to carry out the work, including contractors, FÁS, and a grant based approach whereby the applicant employs the contractor. Health boards have been requested by the task force to use a combination of approaches, with the most suitable being applied as appropriate in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme itself is extremely effective. <Col N="1404" /> Between 1982 and the end of 2000 over 42,000 cases have been dealt with. A further 2,288 jobs have been completed in the period January to June 2001, an increase of 33% on the same period last year, and 2,360 further jobs are under way. An increase of 24% in applications has also been recorded. There has been an unprecedented level of demand for the provision of heating systems since the scheme was introduced in February 2000, with 429 applicants provided with such facilities in the balance of that year and 649 to June 2001.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the valuable work which is being done, funding for the scheme has been increased significantly since 1997 with a provision of £4 million in that year raised to £5 million in 1998, £6 million in 1999, £8 million in 2000 and £8.65 million for 2001. The allocations to the boards are determined by the task force from the funding available and are based, not on the geographical spread of the population, but on the statistical returns received from the health boards showing the level of activity within the area, the actual number of applications on hand and the estimated cost of these applications.</P>
    <P>Funding for the scheme is provided through the national lottery and no further funding is available for 2001. The fact that the scheme is so funded has caused difficulties, as we have been unable to top up the annual provision from savings arising elsewhere in the Department of the Environment and Local Government's Vote and, in this regard, the Minister intends to open a separate Voted subhead for the task force from next year, which should give us greater flexibility where additional funding is needed for the task force. Funding levels for 2002 are at present being considered in the context of the Estimates. However, health boards are being requested on the basis of funding being available next year to arrange further jobs which will not arise for payment until January or later.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to publicly express appreciation of the role played by the various agencies involved in the most valuable work being done under this scheme. I wish to thank and compliment the members of the task force, the health boards, FÁS and the other voluntary bodies associated with the successful operation of the scheme over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea for being here although I am disappointed that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot be here. This is not the first time I have raised the issue of street violence with the Minister and I regret to say I do not think it will be the last time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Street violence and safety on our streets, at night time in particular, is of major concern to young people and to their parents. It has recently become a real concern to the gardaí, whose job it <Col N="1405" /> is to police our streets. Last weekend again saw vicious attacks in Cork and Dublin, with people being stabbed, slashed with broken bottles, punched and kicked. This was just another normal weekend in Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Galway.</P>
    <P>I find it frustrating, as a public representative and legislator, that there seems to has been no improvement in safety on our streets in the three years I have been in this House, despite the Minister's talk of getting tough on street violence and the introduction of encouraging plans such as Operation Oíche and others. Last May, at the conference of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, the Garda commissioner himself admitted that the present policing measures are not having an impact on the level of public disorder and street violence. The person who has responsibility for policing is himself expressing real concerns and frustrations. This concern was backed up by the GRA at its recent conference when a clear frustration was evident at the level of street violence and public disorder, and the safety concerns of the gardaí themselves was stressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take tough action and start by meeting the Garda Commissioner to devise new and more effective ways of policing our streets at night time and at weekends. There has been an increase in Garda visibility on the beat but this needs to increase further. When gardaí are present in numbers trouble does not seem to occur. The recent Cork jazz festival in my own city was a good example of this. There was a significant increase in Garda presence for that weekend and it was more or less trouble free.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see the Minister address the issue of equipping the gardaí for night time duty on the beat. It is totally unacceptable that any member of our police force, male or female, should face the risk of being beaten up while on duty at night time. We should be looking at police forces across Europe and at how they are equipped to deal with violence at night time. We should not go so far as arming our police with guns but we should consider equipment such as extendable batons, stun guns and stab-proof vests. All of these options should be discussed by the Department and the Garda Commissioner.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to report on the effect of the introduction of CCTV cameras throughout the country and on whether it has led to a decrease in street crime in the 14 areas where they are in use. Has this helped surveillance and policing generally?</P>
    <P>The total solution does not lie with improved policing. Measures to tackle under-age drinking, which in Ireland is the worst in Europe although the Government has done nothing about it, to improve the courts system to have person's causing public disorder before a judge quickly and to decrease the general level of alcohol and drug use would all be major contributing factors to reducing the level of street crime.</P>
    <P>However, improved policing is a good place to <Col N="1406" /> start if we want immediate results. We must improve dramatically the numbers on the beat and increase the Garda presence in our towns and cities, we must improve Garda equipment, for their own safety and the safety of the public and we must put aids, such as CCTV, in place in trouble spots in towns and cities.</P>
    <P>In a civilised, modern democracy like Ireland people should not be in fear of being attacked when they go out for an evening. I recently spent five days in Manhattan and I found one could walk anywhere in the centre of New York city without fear of being attacked or harrassed at night time. That is because of tough policies introduced by the Mayor of New York in the last five or six years. If they can do it in New York, surely we can do it in cities like Cork, Dublin, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.</P>
    <P>The present situation of fear among young people on our streets and among their parents who wait for them to come home from pubs and night clubs is unacceptable. It is time our, so called, zero tolerance Minister did something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who cannot be here this evening, and for the benefit of the House, I am pleased to respond to the matters raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that since the Government took office there has been an unprecedented decrease in the level of serious crime, as represented in the figures for indictable offences. Indictable crime has fallen by over 23%, a situation which could not have been imagined just a few years ago. While serious and organised crime has been tackled with a large measure of success, the Minister is also concerned that we tackle those offences that are traditionally categorised as less serious, non-indictable offences. These include the type of offences referred to by Deputy Coveney and are, unfortunately, generally associated with young people. The Minister is all too well aware of the real problems they can cause in our towns and cities, especially late at night.</P>
      <P>That is why one of his priorities has been a major crackdown on this type of crime. We can have no tolerance for the criminal activities of those who show no respect for other members of the community. Primarily, this has involved increased targeted activities by members of the Garda Síochána. These problems have been addressed by the Minister and the Garda commissioner with a number of initiatives which are designed to prevent crime and to reduce the fear of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A national public order initiative, Operation Oíche, has been in operation by the Garda Síochána since October 2000. This operation focuses on the areas of public disorder, public intoxication, under-age drinking, illicit drug use and under-age alcohol sales. Locations and recurring incidents receive particular Garda attention with <Col N="1407" /> the emphasis on high visibility patrolling. Special resource units and unmarked crime task force units are also utilised to the full. Key urban locations have been selected for intensive patrolling, involving the Garda mounted unit, the Garda dog unit and the Garda air support unit.</P>
    <P>Up to the beginning of October this year, 50,984 offences, mainly of a non-violent nature, were detected by the Garda Síochána under various provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1998 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, as amended. The bulk of this figure comprises 22,382 detections for intoxication in a public place; 15,011 detections for threatening, abusive and insulting behaviour; 6,231 detections for failure to comply with a Garda direction; and 5,594 detections for disorderly conduct.</P>
    <P>In considering statistics in relation to public order offences, increased activity by the gardaí has a bearing in relation to the number of offences recorded. The nature of some of these offences, such as intoxication in a public place, is such that they would be unlikely to be recorded unless detected by the gardaí. Thus, the number of detections by the gardaí constitutes a significant success on their part in responding to public concern about personal safety and security through targeted policing measures at specific hot spots of disorder. The Garda authorities consider the operation to have been highly successful to date. Since its introduction there has been a more visible Garda presence on the streets, particularly at the closing times of licensed premises and night clubs. In this regard the Garda Síochána continues to visit licensed premises to impress an even greater awareness on the licensees of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister is further informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Commissioner and his senior officers have prioritised implementation of <Col N="1408" /> the recommendations of the Garda youth policy advisory group report for inclusion in the Garda policing plans for 2002 and beyond. In addition, the Minister's Department, in conjunction with other State agencies, is considering the recommendations of the report, which contains two recommendations relating specifically to matters within his functional remit, namely, the use of mobile CCTV units and the proof of age scheme. In the former case, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is processing a request, received from the Garda authorities, for the purchase of a mobile CCTV unit.</P>
    <P>Garda CCTV schemes are currently operating in central Dublin and Tralee. A system is currently being installed in Cork city and I understand that a number of the cameras are now fully operational. As part of the first tranche of the expansion programme announced last year, CCTV systems are to be installed in a number of towns and cities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other scheme, over 40,000 cards were issued up to the start of October. While the Minister is confident that the age card scheme will assist greatly those operating in the licensed trade and those who run pubs and restaurants, a formal review of the scheme is being conducted. The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, imposes a strict liability on publicans concerning the sale of alcohol to under-age persons, with severe penalties for those who break the law. To date, 49 convictions have been recorded.</P>
    <P>Dealing with under-age drinking should not be seen as the province of State agencies alone. Others are also involved. The Minister is determined to tackle this problem and has the full support of the Garda in this regard. Significant actions have been taken and if further measures are required the Minister will not hesitate to take them.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 14 November 2001.</P>

      <P>Legislative proposals to amend the civil law of defamation and recast it within a more satisfactory legislative framework are being advanced as part of the Government's legislative programme and my Department is, at present, finalising its work on the scheme of a Bill which I intend to bring before Government for approval in the near future.</P>
      <P>Pending the submission of the scheme to Government, it would not be appropriate for me to go into detail about its likely content. However, Deputies will be aware that I have indicated in the past that the proposed Bill will take account of recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission and others for changes in this area of the law. Also, in very broad terms, I have indicated that there is merit in ensuring that remedies other than damages should be put at the disposal of the courts in particular circumstances. Issues surrounding the making of an apology need to be clarified and it is also desirable to remove certain anomalies in the area of lodgments into court.</P>
      <P>This is an area of the law where it is necessary to ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained between the right to a good name and the right to freedom of expression and I am determined the legislative proposals which are in prospect will give due weight to this balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national anti-racism awareness programme developed from a proposal I made to Government which advocated a strategic approach where public awareness would be an important component, but not the only component, of a broader framework of policies and measures to create and promote an inclusive <Col N="1410" /> society. The aim of the programme is to contribute to creating the environment and the conditions for building an inclusive and intercultural society in Ireland where racism is effectively addressed and cultural diversity is valued. Such a comprehensive programme has never been tried before. It is an innovative approach towards tackling racism.</P>
      <P>The programme was officially launched by the Taoiseach on 24 October, 2001. A core budget of £4.5 million, 5.7 million has been allocated by Government to the programme over a three-year period. The programme is being implemented by a high level steering group in partnership with the equal status division of my Department. The 21 member steering group is broad-based and includes representatives of ethnic minority communities, the four social partners, national bodies such as the equality authority and the national consultative committee on racism and interculturalism, relevant Government departments and the Garda Síochána. The steering group has an independent chairperson, Mr. Joe McDonagh, former president of the GAA.</P>
      <P>The framework for the awareness programme was drawn up by the national consultative committee on racism and interculturalism, NCCRI, following a three-month consultation process with key statutory and non-statutory organisations. The programme will be based on partnership and will aim to have a long-term sustainable impact. It will stimulate and support initiatives on an ongoing basis in partnership with key organisations at national level as well as at local level. It will focus on the principal strands in our society, for example, public education, media and communications, statutory authorities, community and local development, the workplace, the Garda Síochána, political parties, sporting bodies and religious organisations. A number of activities will be arranged at national and local level around key anchor events each year such as the International day against racism on 21 March and the anti-racist workplace week in the first week in November.</P>
      <P>The core messages of the programme are: Ireland is increasingly a multicultural society which is a strength; racism is a denial of human rights; minority ethnic groups are a positive and integral part of Irish society; racism is a specific form of discrimination; racism is against the law; inward migration is not the cause of racism; we all have a responsibility to tackle racism; Irish people have been victims of racism themselves; and in celebrating difference we should be open to the benefits of cultural diversity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the programme are twofold, i.e. to combat racism and to inform people about racism. These objectives are encapsulated neatly in the &ldquo;KNOW RACISM&rdquo; logo of the programme. Spreading this message through national advertising campaigns along with the nine core messages of the programme will be a significant element of the programme in the months ahead. The steering group has agreed plans to involve <Col N="1411" /> the programme in joint ventures with statutory, media, sporting and religious organisations as another strategy for spreading these messages. An independent website has also been established by the steering group to enhance access to updated information about the awareness programme.</P>
    <P>One of the first tasks of the steering group was to commission a researcher to gather information on existing research into attitudes and opinions on racism and minority groups. A report on the research was completed in September and the steering group is currently considering its recommendations, particularly, with regard to the need for further surveys.</P>
    <P>The involvement of local communities is an important component of the programme. Last May, the steering group launched two grant schemes to assist community groups, including minority ethnic groups, and non-government organisations with anti-racism awareness initiatives. A total of £200,000 was paid out from the schemes to a total of 134 community groups and organisations in some 23 counties. A second round of grant schemes was launched under the programme earlier this month for similar awareness initiatives. In the second round, the steering group will welcome, particularly, projects which focus on 21 March, international day against racism, or on activities involving young people, or education related activities. The closing date for the second round is 15 November.</P>
    <P>The steering group is examining a number of proposals for larger partnership ventures at national level. Its first major partnership initiative was its participation in the anti-racist workplace week which took place last week 5-9 November. The anti-racist workplace week is organised by the equality authority in partnership with IBEC, ICTU and the Construction Industry Federation. Funding of £150,000 was provided from the awareness programme for national advertising campaigns to accompany the workplace week.</P>
    <P>The steering group would like to involve everybody in the awareness programme. The group is finalising the text of a leaflet, entitled &ldquo;What you can do&rdquo;, which it is planning to send to every household in the country early next year. The leaflet will advise each person, on what he or she, as an individual, can do to reject racism. The steering group will publish a report on its progress in implementing the programme at the end of each year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a wide variety of measures embraced by the conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 20 September concerning the fight against terrorism. A number of these will require legislation to give them effect while others can be implemented on an administrative basis. The requirements of our law, including constitutional requirements, are naturally taken into consideration in determining both how to implement the measures in question and, where negotiations on instruments are ongoing, our approach to those negotiations.</P>
      <P>Measures which will necessitate legislation include the requirement for all member states to give effect to a number of pre-existing European Union and United Nations Conventions relevant to the fight against terrorism. The instruments specifically mentioned in the Council conclusions in this respect were: the 1995 and 1996 EU Conventions on Extradition; the 1999 UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism; and the 2000 EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and the Protocol to that Convention.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to those conventions is as follows: the Extradition (European Union Convention) Bill, 2001, which I published on 9 November will give effect to the first two of those conventions &ndash; the 1995 and 1996 EU Conventions on Extradition. The Bill therefore provides for a system of simplified extradition where a person whose return is being sought consents to extradition in accordance with the 1995 Convention. It also provides, in accordance with the 1996 Convention, for an extended range of extraditable offences, for extradition in the case of revenue offences and for the modification of the rule of specialty as between the member states of the EU as well as providing for a central authority which will be responsible for receiving and transmitting extradition requests which in future will also be capable of being transmitted by facsimile.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Convention on the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism was signed on behalf of Ireland on 15 October as an indication of our determination to proceed quickly with the legislation necessary to give it effect. Work on that legislation has already begun with a view to the submission of my proposals in the matter to Government and publication during the current session.</P>
      <P>The Council of Ministers has asked member states to ratify the EU Mutual Assistance Convention on Criminal Matters and its Protocol during 2002. Work on the legislative proposals necessary for this purpose is proceeding with a view to those proposals being brought forward in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will already be aware that the European Council on 21 September approved a plan of action to counter terrorism. The plan called on member states to implement all existing inter<Col N="1413" /> national Conventions in the fight against terrorism. A similar call was contained in the UN Security Council resolution of 28 September. The Government intends to give effect to other United Nations Conventions relevant to the fight against terrorism which have not been ratified by Ireland to date as part of our response to the events of 11 September. Other legislative proposals which I will be bringing to Government are therefore intended to enable Ireland to become a party to the UN Conventions on the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, Against the Taking of Hostages and on the Prevention and Punishment of Attacks on Internationally Protected Persons. Work is under way in my Department on framing the proposals necessary to give effect to those conventions and I would hope that it will be possible for those to be published during the current session. In addition, steps are being taken for Ireland to accede to the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection, accession to which does not require legislative changes.</P>
    <P>There are certain other measures in the area of money laundering arising from the conclusions of the Council of Ministers which I also hope to be in a position to progress in the short-term and which are likely to require either primary or secondary legislation to give them effect. These include the draft directive on the prevention of the use of the financial system for money laundering and other measures adopted by the EU to deal with countries which have been identified by the OECD financial action task force as non co-operative in the context of the fight against money laundering.</P>
    <P>Work is also continuing within the European Union on taking forward other measures which were covered by the Council of Ministers conclusions and which will require legislation in due course. That work includes the negotiations on the proposed framework decisions on the approximation of member states criminal laws with a view to establishing a common definition of terrorism and common criminal sanctions and on the creation of a European arrest warrant on the basis of proposals initially tabled by the Commission. I have indicated before that the proposed measures raise difficult and complex issues for us and for other member states. I have also acknowledged that the proposal for a European arrest warrant, in particular, raises certain difficulties. Both my Department and I will continue to address the outstanding difficulties in that regard in the ongoing negotiations, which are still some distance from conclusion.</P>

      <P>In line with its terms of reference, the commission on liquor licensing presented an interim report on off-licensing to me in April last. The interim report contains a set of recommendations relating to dormant licences, under age drinking, access to off-licences and certain related matters. I subsequently obtained Government approval to publish it.</P>
      <P>By way of response to the commission's recommendations relating to improved access to off-licences, the Government noted my intention to bring forward proposals for amending legislation at the earliest opportunity. The preparatory work on this new legislation is at an early stage in my Department. Framing this new legislation is not a simple task, however, given the complexity of existing legislation in this area which the commission itself has acknowledged. For this reason, I am unable to say when the proposals for legislation will be ready for publication.</P>
      <P>As regards the recommendations not relating to access to off-licences &ndash; the majority of which fall within the areas of responsibility of other Departments and agencies &ndash; the Government agreed that a co-ordinated response be developed by a high level, interdepartmental working group of the Departments and agencies concerned. This working group presented its report at the end of June. I am happy to say the Departments and agencies concerned responded in a broadly positive and constructive way to the Commission's recommendations and indicated that they would be taking appropriate action to address them in due course. I understand that such action is under way at present. For example, within my own Department, I have established a review group to examine the current age card scheme and to make appropriate recommendations. I expect that it will report to me by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>To underline the importance it attaches to the work of the liquor licensing commission, the Government has requested the working group to present a progress report on all actions taken by Departments and agencies in response to the interim report's recommendations by 31 January 2002.</P>
      <P>The Government has also requested the commission on liquor licensing to submit additional interim reports on issues which can be progressed in advance of the commission's final report at the end of 2002. I am pleased to say that the commission has responded positively to this request and I understand that a number of sub-committees have been established to look at specific areas within the liquor licensing code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission placed advertisements in national newspapers on 23 August last seeking submissions in relation to any aspect of the terms of reference and, in particular to: access to <Col N="1415" /> licences in urban and suburban centres of population; off-licence sales in convenience stores attached to garage forecourts; night-clubs, theatres and places of public entertainment and related public order issues; and registered clubs.</P>
    <P>I understand that the commission is unable to say at present when further interim reports are likely to be ready for submission.</P>

Enforcement of the traffic legislation is a matter for the Garda Síochána. I am informed by the Garda authorities that they do not consider that there is any lack of resources or limitations in legislation which hinders the enforcement capability of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that my responsibilities in relation to road safety are mainly in the areas of the provision of Garda resources and Garda traffic law enforcement. In relation to resources, the Garda authorities have sought and have obtained my Department's sanction to purchase a range of equipment, including mobile speed detection equipment, which is used to detect road traffic offences. My Department gives full consideration to all reasonable Garda requests for such equipment. In addition, the requirements of the Garda Síochána in relation to the introduction of penalty points for certain road traffic offences are being taken into account in the development of new Garda computer facilities. I appreciate the importance of this project and it will be progressed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to manpower, the Garda national traffic bureau, headed by a chief superintendent and based at Garda headquarters, was established in 1997 to give greater focus and direction to Garda road safety campaigns. There is a traffic unit in every Garda division with special responsibility for traffic law enforcement. These are full time and dedicated to traffic issues, unless required to get involved in emergency duties. The number of traffic units is now 29, up from 16 in 1996. Two additional units are to be established in the near future in Carlow and Cavan. In 1996 there were 40 sergeants and 272 gardaí dedicated full time to traffic. In 2001, the total is 58 sergeants and 369 gardaí. In addition, all uniformed gardaí throughout the State are involved in traffic law enforcement as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enforcement priorities of the Garda Síochána are in line with the key targets of the Govern<Col N="1417" /> ment's national strategy on road safety 1998-2002 i.e speeding, drink driving and non-wearing of seat belts. The implementation of this strategy is being overseen by the inter-agency high level group on road safety which includes the chairman of the national safety council.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the strategy, Garda enforcement and detection, in relation to road traffic offences has increased significantly. The principal Garda enforcement campaign is &ldquo;Operation Lifesaver&rdquo;, which is focusing primarily on speeding, drink driving, seat belt offences and vulnerable road users. Specifically in relation to drink driving offences, the number of detections in 2000 at 10,433 represents a 24% increase on 1998. I am informed by the Garda authorities there have been more than 9,000 detections this year to date for suspected drink driving.</P>
    <P>On the issue of drink driving legislation, this is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I refer the Deputy to the Road Traffic Bill, 2001, which is due to be debated in the Dáil this session. There is provision in the Bill for extending the grounds on which a Garda may require a driver to provide a preliminary breath specimen to include situations where a driver is involved in a road accident or where the Garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives taken in relation to drink driving under the national strategy include the extension of evidential breath testing, EBT, to 25 Garda stations by the end of 2000. It is intended to have this form of testing available in 40 stations by the end of this year. The use of EBT avoids the need for a doctor to take a blood or urine sample from a suspect, though this remains an option. The EBT machines are supplied by the medical bureau of road safety.</P>
    <P>I also refer the Deputy to my reply today to Priority Question No. 83 on the issue of traffic law enforcement. I assure the House that I will continue to give consideration to any request from the Garda authorities for additional resources to aid the enforcement of the road traffic laws.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> I am further informed that all complaints are treated seriously with due regard for the sensitivity of the complainant. Due regard must also be had for the rights of the member complained of, bearing in mind that a complaint amounts to no more than an allegation unless the facts have been satisfactorily established by the investigation.</P>
    <P>All complaints, reports and correspondence in relation to sexual harassment are treated with the utmost confidentiality and will not be available to any person who does not have direct responsibility for dealing with such complaints. I am further informed that the policy is currently being reviewed.</P>
    <P>In addition to the arrangements in place within the Garda Síochána, I should also state that section 23 of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, provides that sexual harassment in the workplace may, in certain circumstances, constitute discrimination, on the gender ground, in relation to conditions of employment. As such, any person who claims to have been discriminated against by another in contravention of the Act may, subject to the provisions of the Act, seek redress by referring the matter to the director of equality investigations.</P>

      <P>The Garda national immigration bureau was established in May 2000 and is responsible for all Garda matters pertaining to immigration on a national basis. Members of an Garda Síochána acting in their capacity as immigration officers at ports of entry to the State are required under the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, to receive applications for political asylum and to permit applicants to remain in the State while their applications are being processed. Garda immigration officers are not in a position to determine whether asylum claims are well founded and such determinations are outside their remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding that there is a considerable amount of evidence to suggest that a significant proportion of adult female asylum applicants are pregnant upon arrival in the State and that their decision to seek asylum in Ireland is, at least in part, motivated by the anticipation of the benefits which might accrue for themselves, their partner and their child as a result of that child being born in Ireland and therefore automatically deriving an entitlement to Irish citizenship. There are good grounds for believing that Ireland's unusual <Col N="1419" /> legal situation in this regard is well known abroad.</P>
    <P>In 2001 to end October, my Department has received 4,503 applications for permission to remain on the basis of parentage of an Irish citizen child from current or former asylum applicants. While it is the case that some such persons could also have a well founded basis for seeking asylum, a large proportion of such applicants either withdraw their asylum claims when seeking permission to remain or are refused refugee status under the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>

      <P>Operation Trace was established by the Garda commissioner for the specific purpose of establishing whether any common denominator linked any of the cases of six women who went missing in Leinster between 1993 and 1998.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by Garda authorities that Operation Trace has engaged in a comprehensive review of these cases. The gardaí in the locality where the disappearances occurred investigated each of these disappearances in depth. No evidence has been uncovered to suggest a link or the involvement of a common offender. An aspect of the disappearances is the absence of an identifiable crime scene and the fact that no bodies have been located. This has resulted in a complete lack of forensic or pathological evidence, which is a significant absence.</P>
      <P>A unique database, OVID, offenders, victims and incidents database, has been set up in the incident room, Naas, that contains salient and peripheral details of the relevant cases, incidents and suspects. This facilitates cross-referencing and highlighting of any existing similarities.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that as a result of the media publicity which surrounded Operation Trace, members of the public came forward with information that yielded many lines of inquiries. All avenues of investigation have been and will continue to be pursued vigorously. I have been assured by the Garda authorities that should An Garda Síochána consider that sufficient evidence exists to warrant a criminal charge in any of the cases under investigation, a file will be referred to the DPP for his directions.</P>

These actions, which underline that the drugs issue is a priority for co-operation in the fields of health, education and justice and home affairs, as well as in relations with non-member countries and relevant fora, are being implemented.</P>

      <P>The review group on investment based naturalisation was established to review the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act to see how it might facilitate investment and, if in the course of that review, information emerged that would warrant additional legislative measures, such change should be considered.</P>
      <P>My stated position on a number of occasions in this matter is that the scheme has been abolished and I have no plans to re-introduce it. Second, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001, which was enacted on 6 June last, made extensive changes to Irish citizenship law as enunciated in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 to 1994 and I do not intend to revisit the issue of investment based naturalisation in the context of legislative change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, the office of the refugee applications commissioner is responsible for considering applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the refugee appeals tribunal is responsible for consideration of appeals.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy and covering the period 1 January, 2001 to 31 October, 2001, which is the most up to date information available, is set out in the following tabular statements. In relation to the first ten months of this year, there were 8,461 asylum applications compared to 9,080 applications in the first ten months of 2000 &ndash; 6.8% decrease.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the office of the refugee applications commissioner, ORAC, that, since July 2001, cases scheduled, processed and completed significantly exceeded intake. In July, 961 applications were received, 1,473 interviews were scheduled and 1,072 cases processed. In August, 983 applications were received, 1,543 interviews were scheduled and 1,407 cases processed. In September, 855 applications were received, 1,594 interviews scheduled and 1,145 cases were processed and in October, 892 applications were received, 1,213 interviews were scheduled and 1,506 cases were processed.</P>
      <P>These figures provide a clear indication that the increase in processing capacity which has been put in place as part of the Government's strategy is starting to make a real impact on the backlog of cases on hand and will help to progressively reduce processing times on an incremental basis.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 110, 125 and 930 of 3 October, 2001, it is expected that by the end of this year all outstanding cases from 1998 to the end of 2000 will have been scheduled for interview with the overwhelming majority processed to finality. Thus, from the end of this year, the ORAC will effectively be focusing mainly on applications submitted in 2001. Already some applications made in May 2001 have been scheduled for interview.</P>
      <P>In relation to appeals, I have been informed by the refugee appeals tribunal, RAT, that it now expects to complete approximately 3,600 appeals in 2001. As with the ORAC, having regard to the increased processing capacity which has been put in place as part of the Government's strategy, there has been a significant increase in the number of hearings scheduled with over 3,000 hearings expected to be scheduled for 2001, to end of year compared with 1,119 for 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there are now approximately 5,500 backlog cases, i.e. cases which are more than six months old on hands in ORAC and RAT <Col N="1425" /> as at 31 October, 2001 and, as I outlined in my reply of 3 October, it is expected that the vast majority of these will be scheduled by the end of year.</P>
    <P>The significant progress achieved to date in the processing of asylum applications in the State provides further evidence of the successful implementation of the Government's asylum strategy.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the findings of a report conducted for the women's health unit of the Eastern Regional Health Authority which found that many asylum seekers having babies here live in hostels so crowded that there is no space for a cot and that many do not have the use of a bath; the steps being taken to address these shortcomings in the level of accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers is an unpublished report which I <Col N="1426" /> understand to be in draft form conducted for the women's health unit of the Northern Area Health Board on behalf of the three area health boards in the eastern region. Neither my Department nor the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), which is responsible for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers under the system of direct provision in place since April 2000, had any knowledge of the report prior to publication of elements of it in a newspaper article.</P>
      <P>It appears that the findings of the report in respect of the provision of accommodation and other facilities for asylum seekers relates to the period prior to the commencement of direct provision when such matters were the responsibility of health boards. Accordingly, I am not in a position to comment on matters over which I have no responsibility or jurisdiction. I should also state for the sake of clarity that the reference in the report and in the subsequent newspaper article to unidentified accommodation used by the Department to accommodate refugees does not appear to be correct. One facility which comprises a complex of apartment blocks in Cork city was contracted in July 2000 by the RIA for accommodating asylum seekers. This facility, which is used principally for housing single and asylum seeker couples, has all appropriate facilities, including cots, for the very small number of infant children accommodated there.</P>
      <P>As regards the general situation in regard to facilities in use by the RIA, the following is the position. To meet the accommodation and related needs of asylum seekers 76 accommodation centres together with nine reception centres located in 24 counties are in use by the RIA. Each property is inspected by officials from the RIA prior to its use and proprietors must sign a comprehensive memorandum of agreement drawn up by the RIA which stipulates the stringent requirements for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>In the case of State owned properties such agreements are entered into with management companies. Under the terms of these agreements proprietors and management companies are required to ensure that the premises complies and operates in accordance with all statutory requirements of local authorities and other agencies in relation to planning, building by-laws, bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, sewage disposal, fire precautions and general safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In circumstances where asylum seeker parents and their children are accommodated in centres operating under the aegis of the RIA, particular emphasis is placed on meeting their needs. It is the policy of the RIA that cots are provided in each reception and accommodation centre where infants are accommodated and that toilet and bathroom facilities are provided in accordance with relevant statutory requirements. In this regard, the memoranda of agreement stipulate that, at a minimum, in addition to cots, the following should be available &ndash; infant formula, infant food; access to fresh water (for the prep<Col N="1427" /> aration of infant formula), sterilises (sufficient for the number of infant children), kettles (for boiling water), fridges (for infant formula bottles) and microwave-bottle warmers. Tea, coffee and snacks are made available to residents outside of meal times and, where possible, mothers are facilitated in cooking for their children. In order to facilitate social interaction visitors are encouraged between 10 a.m and 10 p.m. each day. Bed linen is changed as required but is changed in any event at least on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate unit within the RIA conducts regular detailed inspections of each location where asylum seekers are accommodated and any diminution in standards which come to light as a result of such inspections are treated very seriously and can lead to termination of contracts where this is deemed to be warranted.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my written reply to the same question on 3 October 2001, tabled in the name of Deputy Penrose, the total figure for overtime expenditure in 2000 was £38,683,977. The largest overtime payment to any one individual was £44,485 which was paid to a prison officer in Mountjoy Prison. The average overtime per officer during 2000 was £12,336.</P>
      <P>The Irish Prison Service is continuing to monitor levels of overtime and to take corrective action where possible. The underlying problems associated with the level of additional attendance involved in the operation of the prisons do not lend themselves to short-term solutions. Staffing levels and arrangements are the product of operational circumstances which have been in place for many decades against a background, at times, of considerable tensions and difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has long been recognised that the only way of addressing the problem is to follow a long-term strategy which addresses the methods of deployment and conditions of service which give rise to the present high levels of overtime. This is the approach which is now being taken. Details of the <Col N="1429" /> initiatives which have already been taken to address the issue of overtime in the prison service in a comprehensive way as well as information on the current progress being made in the matter, in conjunction with the Prison Officers Association, are set out in my reply of 3 October.</P>

      <P>A commitment has been made in the Government's legislative programme to publish a disabilities Bill. Work on the legislation is on-going in my Department, based on agreed heads of Bill, and is now at an advanced stage of preparation. Deputy O'Sullivan will be aware from previous statements in the House and elsewhere that the Government intends to publish the Bill before Christmas.</P>
      <P>The disabilities Bill is a positive action measure which will enhance and underpin the ability of people with disabilities to participate more fully in everyday life. Consultation with agencies, organisations and interest groups associated with the disability sector was undertaken in the latter part of 2000 in tandem with research and analysis of relevant national and international legislation. Consultation with Departments has also been ongoing. In view of the extensive consultation that has already taken place and the fact that the broad thrust of the proposals are already known, I do not propose engaging in any major consultation process prior to the anticipated publication of the Bill next month. In any event, I and the Minister of State continue to be available to engage with disability groups and others in teasing out specific issues relevant to the Bill. Ample opportunity will be available to study the detailed provisions of the Bill on its publication and passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disabilities Bill will be the fourth piece of major legislation relating to disability equality to be introduced by this Government and has been progressed in the context of the legislative and infrastructural framework for equality which the Government has put in place. The Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, prohibit discrimination on nine specified grounds, including that of disability, in the workplace and in the provision of goods and services. The Equality Authority and Director of Equality Investigations, established to implement this legislation, are now fully operational. The National Disability Authority Act, 1999, provides for the establishment of the National Disability Authority as a statutory agency dedicated to disability policy and practice, and is also fully oper<Col N="1430" /> ational. The disabilities Bill will further reinforce the principles of disability equality and greatly consolidate the strides made by this Government in creating a full framework for their implementation.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's concern regarding the unacceptable level of road deaths and traffic accidents. The inter-agency high level group on road safety is currently engaged in implementing the Government's National Strategy on Road Safety, 1998-2002.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the substance of the Deputy's question, I should state that road deaths and serious injuries are in decline in recent years and this trend is continuing in 2001. For example, in 2000, road deaths are 12.1% down on the 1997 level. Up to 31 October 2001 the number of road deaths at 332 is down 15 on the same period last year. However, the level of road deaths is still profoundly unacceptable and efforts to bring about a further reduction in road deaths and serious injuries are being continued by the Garda Síochána, my Department, and the other agencies responsible for implementing the national strategy on road safety.</P>
      <P>In relation to enforcement since 1997, Garda traffic policing has undergone a number of changes in order to improve Garda enforcement capability. In this regard, there is a Garda national traffic bureau, headed by a chief superintendent, based at Garda headquarters. The bureau gives focus and develops policy in relation to enforcement and is represented on the high level group on road safety.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the bureau liaises with local Garda divisional heads on road safety initiatives, including local and national road safety campaigns. I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is a minimum of one traffic unit in every Garda division with special responsibility for traffic law enforcement. In addition, other Garda personnel are involved in traffic law enforcement through involvement in routine policing as well as specific district, divisional, regional and national traffic law enforcement operations.</P>
      <P>Traffic unit members are not assigned to other non-traffic duties unless required to get involved in emergency duties. The number of traffic units operating throughout the State is now 29, up from 16 in 1996. Two additional units are to be established in the near future in Carlow and Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> If members of a separate traffic corps were to be given powers, limited to road traffic matters, they would not be able to intervene in other police matters which come to their attention in the course of their duties. The Garda authorities consider the existing arrangements represent the best use of resources.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that road traffic enforcement is an integral element of Garda policing plans and is afforded a very high priority. The Garda are currently engaged in Operation Lifesaver, the principal Garda traffic enforcement campaign, which operates on a nationwide basis. This campaign is focusing on speeding, drink driving, seat belt offences and dangerous/careless driving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 119, 467 and 468 together.</P>
      <P>Our courts system has recently undergone the most comprehensive and radical reform of court administration since the foundation of the State. In November 1999, I established the independent Courts Service on a statutory basis under the Courts Service Act, 1998. Under the Act, responsibility for the management of the courts system is now conferred on the Courts Service.</P>
      <P> The structures which have now been put in place will put the Courts Service in a much better position to meet the demands placed on it and to provide a first class service to judges, practitioners, court staff and most importantly of course, the users of the system. In order to reflect the Government's commitment to ensuring the success of the Courts Service, I have obtained Government approval for an increase in the allocation to the Courts Vote from £30.4 million, (38.6 million in 1997 to £64.9 million, 82.4 million, this year &ndash; a 113% increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Courts Service has published a strategic plan for the period 2000 &ndash; 2003 in which it set out the high level goals of the organisation, having regard to its statutory mandate. In line with Government policy on decentralisation the Courts Service is in the process of establishing <Col N="1433" /> seven regional offices to provide a local administrative structure for the service. These offices will have responsibility for devolved functions in a wide range of areas including, IT, building projects, human resource issues, streamlining of procedures, budgetary matters, etc.</P>
    <P>I have provided funding for an additional 21 staff to implement these new regional structures. This will assist in ensuring the effective and efficient delivery of court services at local level. The Courts Service's strategic plan also recognises that information technology has the potential to transform the way the courts work, and provide the foundation for the future delivery of high quality services to all court users and at the same time implement Government policy in relation to the information society. To this end the Courts Service has prepared a five year strategy for information technology entitled &ldquo;eCourts&rdquo;, which has been submitted to my Department and the Department of Finance. The funding of this plan is currently being considered by my Department and the Department of Finance. I might mention, in this regard, that I have secured an increase in the provision for IT development in the courts of over 700% &ndash; i.e, from £954,000, 1.2 million, in 1997 to £7.8 million, 9.9 million, this year. This has allowed the service to make significant progress already in the IT area.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive statistics in regard to waiting times generally were published in the Courts Service Annual Report, 2000, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, and I am aware that delays exist in relation to the hearing of divorce and judicial separation matters in some Circuit Court venues. In this regard I arranged, with Government approval, for the appointment of an additional judge of the Circuit Court in February last year and the appointment of a further extra judge in January of this year. The allocation of these judicial resources is, of course, a matter for the President of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>With regard to the High Court, provision is being made in the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 2001, at present before Dáil Éireann, for an increase in the number of ordinary judges which may be assigned to the High Court from 24 to 25. There are also proposals in the same Bill for significant changes in the civil jurisdictions of the Circuit and District Courts which may impact on the numbers of judges needed in the various courts, and I will be keeping this matter under review.</P>
    <P>In so far as the hearing of family law business generally is concerned, I might mention that a sub-committee of the Courts Service Board has been established to review the current procedure and manner in which family law is dealt with by the courts and to make recommendations to the board in relation thereto. If, arising from the work of this sub-committee, which is ongoing, the board decides to make formal proposals to me in relation to legislative change or any other matters which may lie within my area of responsibility as <Col N="1434" /> Minister, I will, of course, give such proposals my full consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of courthouse accommodation, section 5 of the Courts Service Act, 1998 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the functions of the service shall be to provide, manage and maintain court buildings, and to provide facilities for court users.</P>
    <P>The continued upgrading of the courts building stock was identified as a key objective by the Courts Service in its Strategic Plan 2000-2003. The Courts Service has finalised a seven year capital building programme 2002-2008 in line with this strategic plan. This programme is under consideration in my Department at present and the possibility of utilising a public-private partnership approach is being examined in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have been able to obtain Government approval for the allocation of significant funds for courthouse upgrading in recent years. During the lifetime of this Government, the financial provision for court buildings has increased from £8.9 million, 11.3 million, to £22.5 million, 28.6 million, this year, which represents an increase of over 150%. I expect to be in a position to provide at least this level of funding for court buildings in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government is committed to ensuring equal opportunities for people with disabilities in the areas of training and employment and has taken a strategic approach to policy development involving both legislative and positive action measures to achieve this end.</P>
      <P>The Government made a critical change in the law in this area with the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which provides protection for people with disabilities in employment and training against discrimination. Under this Act, the Equality Authority was established to underpin statutory rights under the Act and to provide a means of redress. I am proud to say that this legislation places Ireland ahead of many other member states in the European Community with regard to the protection for people with disabilities against discrimination in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under a Government commitment in the PPF, every Department is required to take appropriate action to ensure that agencies under its aegis achieve the 3% target for the employment of <Col N="1435" /> people with disabilities in the public service at an early date. In 1999, the Government established a monitoring committee chaired by my Department to monitor and guide progress towards achievement of this target in the public service, outside the Civil Service. The committee has supported a number of initiatives over the last two years including approval of a draft code of practice for use in the public service and exploration of the options for common selection procedures for people with disabilities, raising awareness of the 3% target among and giving information to chief executives, personnel officers and disability equality officers in the public service through a series of eight regional seminars, and publication of an information brochure, publication of a brochure designed to encourage people with disabilities to consider a career in the public service and promotion of this at the Public Sector Careers Expo in April, 2001, and commissioned research on the issues and barriers relating to achievement of the target in six public service organisations. It is intended to launch this report next week.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance is responsible for the 3% target of employment of people with disabilities within the Civil Service. The Department of Finance has commissioned a study on career progression of people with disabilities in the Civil Service in partnership with my Department and the Civil Service Commission. This study will help to inform personal and career development of people with disabilities in the Civil Service including, if necessary, revisions to the 1994 Civil Service code of practice on the employment of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant developments has been the introduction of mainstreaming disability policy which was launched by an Taoiseach in June 2000, requiring that public service bodies which provide services for the public are the same bodies that provide services for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Employment and vocational training policies for people with disabilities are now formulated as part of general labour market policy underlining the move from a medical attitude to disability to an inclusive economic and social view of disability.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of mainstreaming policy the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS are responsible for the employment and vocational training of people with disabilities. My Government colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has initiated a number of positive action measures to improve employment opportunities for people with disabilities. These measures include the launch, in July 2000, of a national supported employment programme which will place up to 800 people with disabilities into employment in the open labour market, funding for a social partner initiative, <Col N="1436" /> led by ICTU and IBEC, to promote the employment of people with disabilities in the private sector; increased funding for existing employment supports for employers and for people with disabilities, the introduction of new supports such as disability awareness training grants and employee retraining grants, increased emphasis on progression from vocational training to employment for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In addition, people with disabilities can avail of the full range of FÁS programmes and services available to help people prepare for and find employment. Funding for vocational training and employment services targeted at people with disabilities has increased significantly since 1999 and over £32.5 million is being provided this year alone.</P>
    <P>The mainstreaming process is still in the early stages and service providers, employers, clients and employees are adapting to the new arrangements that were put in place formally in June 2000 and which are developing in response to the new policy. I am confident that these new policies supported by the Employment Equality Act will assist people with disabilities to access training and employment opportunities.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Draft National Plan for Women 2001-2005 which was launched by the Minister of State <Col N="1437" /> with special responsibility for Equality, Deputy Wallace, on 16 October 2001. This publication is designed to guide and inform a consultation process leading to a national plan for the women of Ireland for the five years 2001-05. The consultation process will culminate in a public forum which is due to be held in the early part of 2002. It is hoped to submit the draft final plan to Government for approval and publication before the summer.</P>
      <P>The draft plan has its origins in a series of United Nations conferences on women held over the last 25 years culminating in the Beijing Platform for Action and Declaration. The platform for action encouraged governments to develop implementation strategies or plans of action. The implementation of the platform for action was reviewed by the United Nations at a special session of the General Assembly in New York in 2000. I stated at that session that the Irish Government was working on the development of a national plan for women and that consultation with non-governmental organisations would be an important part of the work of developing the plan. The draft plan and consultation process now in train is an essential element towards fulfilling that commitment.</P>
      <P>I anticipate the involvement of a large number of women's representative groups, other non-governmental organisations, the social partners and other stakeholders and women generally as well as the statutory and private sectors in the consultation process. The involvement of women and their representative groups is essential to ensure that the consultation process is comprehensive and inclusive. Women's groups can apply until 16 November 2001 to my Department for grants to facilitate them in disseminating information, holding workshops or discussion groups to assist in formulating views on the plan.</P>
      <P>The draft plan is in three parts. Part one brings together current Government commitments to policies, strategies, programmes and measures agreed by the Government in relation to advancing the status of women in Irish society over the next five years. These commitments are outlined under the 12 critical areas of concern in the United Nations Beijing Platform for Action. Commitments listed are actual Government commitments, which are either in the course of being delivered on, or are in the planning process. Many of these commitments are contained in the Government Action Programme for the Millennium, the national development plan, and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>Part two of the draft plan addresses how progress on the advancement of women could be measured in the 12 critical areas of concern. A list of possible gender sensitive indicators is outlined. The development of indicators is an essential element in measuring the success of any programme. The consultation process will have a very important role in agreeing appropriate and relevant indicators. Part two also contains some statistics in relation to women in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> Part three will be used to provide a vision of the aspirations of women in relation to the 12 critical areas of concern in the Beijing Platform for Action. This vision will be articulated through the consultation process on the plan and we welcome the views of all Irish women during the consultation process which closes on 25 January 2002.</P>
    <P>A steering committee, chaired by my Department and including representatives from Government Departments and agencies, the social partners and women's representative groups is in place to oversee the consultation process leading to the preparation of the final plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the National Children's Nurseries Association (NCNA) carried out a survey with its members last summer. However a copy of the final report has not been presented to my Department. Upon request, on the 8 November 2001 the NCNA provided my officials with part of the initial results of their survey. The initial results do highlight a difference in the costs of child care depending on the location of the service. However, the information obtained by my officials does not show that the mean weekly fee for child care in Dublin is three times as much as the mean weekly fee in rural areas. The NCNA have informed my Department that, leading on from this survey, they have undertaken to gain further details of the costs of delivering child care.</P>
      <P>As regards the costs of child care arrangements my Department has approved funding to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to carry out research on the child care arrangements of union members. This research project was undertaken in autumn 2001 and the report should be available in the not too distant future. The ICTU research in conjunction with the NCNA findings, when completed, will provide valuable information on the actual costs of childcare arrangements today as reported by those who participated in the surveys.</P>
      <P>This Government identified child care as a priority area for investment in the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. In total £344 million, 436 million, comprising EU and Exchequer funding has been allocated to my Department over the course of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to improve child care provision and quality throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1439" /> Since the announcement of the availability of grants in April 2000, I have approved more than £76 million, more than 96 million, in funding under the equal opportunities child care programme. Of this, over £64 million (over 81 million) has been allocated in the form of capital or staffing grants to enhance child care services on the ground. Over 25,000 child care places will be supported by the funding committed by my Department which includes the creation of more than 11,000 new child care places.</P>
    <P>As regards supports for parents, a very significant development in this regard is the improvement in the rate of child benefit. My colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in budget 2001 indicated that a core objective is to provide support which will offer real choice to parents and which will benefit all children. In 2001, payment rates increased by £25, 31.7, per month for the first and second child to £67.50, 85.7, and by £30, 38, per month for third and subsequent children to £86, 109.2, per month. Furthermore, the Minister announced that payment of these increases would be brought forward by three months to June rather than the September date which applied previously. These increases marked the first step in a three year programme which will see an additional £1 billion, 1.27 billion, being invested in child related payments and will bring the child benefit rates to £117.50, 149.19, and £146, 185.38, respectively, by 2003, well beyond the PPF commitments. It is also worth noting that child benefit is recognised as the most effective way of combating child poverty and, of course, payments are made directly to the principal carer of the child.</P>
    <P>The measures in place by my Department, as outlined above, together with the increase in child benefit rates announced in budget 2001, reaffirm this Government's commitment to keeping childcare at the forefront of its social agenda.  </P>

In relation to freezing of assets action has already been taken in accordance with EU regulations giving effect to decisions of the UN sanctions committee in appropriate cases. My Department is playing a full and active part in this work and considerable progress has already been made in developing detailed proposals. It is intended that the results of that work will come to the Justice and Home Affairs Council for decision when it meets on 6 and 7 December.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism was signed by Ireland on 15 October 2001. A Bill is at present being prepared in my Department as a matter of urgency which will allow for the early ratification of the convention by this country.                                         Ireland endorsed the proposals to combat terrorism agreed by Ministers at the special Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 20 September. This included in particular the assignment of national experts on terrorism to a special Europol unit. Ireland has assigned an expert on terrorism from the Garda Síochana to work with this unit in the Hague. A number of proposals to amend the Europol convention to improve the effectiveness of Europol have been put forward. The Council of Ministers agreed recently that a number of these proposals should be examined as a matter of priority. Ireland is participating actively in that process.</P>

      <P>Under section 9(4)(f2&gt;a) of the Refugee Act, 1996, asylum seekers are prohibited from leaving the State without consent. The Department's legal advice is that the 1951 Geneva Convention obliges it to give sympathetic consideration to requests from asylum applicants for a travel document to enable them to travel temporarily while pursuing their claims. If there are good grounds for believing that the person intends to abuse the travel document in order to evade immigration controls elsewhere, this could constitute a valid reason for refusal. According to the advice received, however, the fact that a per<Col N="1442" /> son intends to travel in order to obtain an abortion would not, in itself, be sufficient reason to refuse a request to travel. The advice is that to refuse an applicant a travel document under such circumstances would have the effect of impeding her normal freedom to travel.</P>
      <P>Consequently there has been consent to a small number of requests of this nature. Statistics are not maintained on the number of travel documents issued according to purpose of travel but my understanding is that the number of women issued with a travel document under these circumstances in 2000 and to date in 2001 was two and eight, respectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 67 and 180 of 12 April 2001, Nos. 61 and 152 of 7 February 2001 and No. 88 of 15 November 2000 which dealt with the issue of the entitlement of asylum seekers to enter into paid employment. As I previously informed the House, it is not proposed to allow asylum applicants who are not covered by the Government's decision of July 1999, which was a once-off arrangement, to take up paid employment pending a final decision being made on their applications.</P>
      <P>The call made by the Irish Refugee Council, IRC, that asylum seekers should be granted the right to work once they have spent six months here was but one of a number of policy recommendations contained in a policy document entitled, The right to work = the right to dignity, which was published on World Refugee Day, 6 June 2001. In addition to the call for the right to work, the IRC also called for, <i>inter alia, </i>applicants granted the right to work to be allowed to remain in the State even if their application for asylum is unsuccessful. This is notwithstanding the fact that the IRC, in the same policy document, acknowledges that deportation is an inherent part of any asylum processing system &ndash; a fact also generally acknowledged by the UNHCR. I should stress that the expectation which is central to the integrity of our asylum and immigration process is that applicants who are not successful in achieving refugee status after a full and fair determination of their applications, including the possibility to appeal and to take judicial review proceedings, will return to their countries of origin.</P>
      <P>The Government has, over the past years, given very serious and extensive consideration to this issue before deciding that, as a matter of public policy, asylum seekers should not be allowed to work while their applications are being considered. With the accumulated experience garnered over the passage of time in dealing with the asylum seeker issue and all its complexities and in the light of the situation which arose following the Government decision of July 1999 to delimit the prohibition on the right to work, I am more convinced than ever that there should be no further departure from stated Government policy. For the avoidance of any misunderstanding on the part of those who have called for a change of heart on this policy, I want to make it clear that I do not doubt the sincerity with which they hold or express their view on this very complex and difficult issue. I assure the House that, if it was my belief that the public interest would be best served by changing Government policy on this issue, I would recommend such a course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of key reasons why I believe that the present policy in relation to access to work by asylum seekers should not be changed: first, section 9(4)(<i>b</i>) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that an <Col N="1445" /> applicant for asylum shall not seek or enter employment. It must also be borne in mind that, under the Act, asylum seekers only have temporary permission to remain in the State pending the determination of their applications. However, we must face the fact that, despite its humanitarian purpose, large numbers of persons are seeking protection under the Act, which gives effect to the State's obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention, for the purpose of avoiding legitimate immigration controls in order to gain a foothold in the State for economic reasons. Similar trends are being experienced by other EU states. In 2000, over 90% of the claims for asylum were not upheld after processing through a fair and transparent system in the State.</P>
    <P>Second, I am convinced that any extension of the right to work arrangement would greatly undermine the Government's asylum strategy which is aimed at greatly increasing processing capacity to deliver more speedy decisions in relation to applications for refugee status. I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Questions No. 110, 125 and 930 of 3 October 2001 which provided clear evidence of significant progress being made in relation to the implementation of this strategy &ndash; I have today provided further information to the House, in response to a question from Deputy Broughan, regarding the current position in relation to processing of applications. The majority of the 370 additional staff sanctioned by the Government for the asylum and immigration areas are in place and processing capacity is now exceeding current intake leading to major progress towards the achievement of the strategy. The UNHCR recently acknowledged the significant increases in staff and resources put in place in the asylum area in the past few years and recognised that time should be allowed for the system to become fully efficient.</P>
    <P>Third, I believe that extending the right to work, as suggested by the IRC, would have a very negative impact on asylum numbers as was experienced in the aftermath of the July 1999 decision to do so. The immediate effect of that measure was a threefold increase in the average number of applications per month leading to a figure of 1,217 applications in December 1999, compared with an average of 364 per month for the period January to July 1999. This represented the highest ever number of applications received in the State in any month to date. Indeed, I would point out that, since the various public calls by the IRC and others for the extension of the right to work last June, we experienced upward pressure in terms of asylum applications from early June onwards.</P>
    <P>Fourth, any significant increase in applications, would also have a significant negative impact on our capacity to accommodate asylum applicants while they are awaiting a determination of their claims. As things stand, the ongoing provision of services to meet the reception, health and welfare and accommodation needs of asylum seekers is an enormous challenge for all the State agencies <Col N="1446" /> who work in this area. The information at my disposal indicates that all these services are at full stretch in dealing with the existing intake and that any sudden surge of applicants would quite simply overwhelm the system.</P>
    <P>Fifth, I believe that the proposal as outlined by the IRC, in addition to becoming a pull factor, would generate a very large surge in economic migrants claiming asylum as the preferred route into the labour market to work illegally. It would also provide an incentive for applicants to use every available opportunity to delay the asylum process to get to the proposed six months benchmark. It could, indeed, totally undermine the current and effective work permit system, particularly when many current asylum applicants are from countries, for example, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldova, the Czech Republic, Poland, Croatia and other Central and Eastern European states, whose nationals are gaining significant employment access through this system. The proposal by the IRC would, in my opinion, further widen the gap in a negative manner in terms of reward between those who access the labour market legally through the work permit and work visa channels and those who simply abuse the asylum process to gain entry.</P>
    <P>Sixth, it is a well established fact that those engaged in trafficking and those seeking to access the labour market without going through the appropriate legal channels are very quick to identify any perceived attractiveness of a country as a preferred or easily accessed destination. It is clear from the profile of applicants, and the results of the determination process, that a significant number of people have come and sought asylum in Ireland with a view to seeking work. Many people are already working illegally. It is my very strong belief that any extension of the right to work to all applicants, even if it was after six months in the determination process as suggested by the IRC, would be portrayed abroad by people traffickers to potential victims as a cast iron guarantee of a right to work as soon as they arrive in Ireland irrespective of the amount of time they spend in the asylum process.</P>
    <P>I would have to stress the need to avoid any action which jeopardises the progress made to date in the implementation of the Government strategy. As I have already stated, while I recognise the sincerity of those calling for the introduction of the right to work, the reality of the impact of such an initiative does not seem to be fully appreciated. Any measures or signals which activate surges in intake numbers would not only put very great strain on the already overburdened asylum system both in terms of numbers to be processed and accommodation needs of applicants but would increase the overall cost of this system which, of course, has to be funded by the Exchequer. This would be a particularly unwelcome scenario given the current global economic situation from which Ireland is not immune.</P>
    <P>I believe that the greatest service we can provide to those who should be recognised as refu<Col N="1447" /> gees is to ensure that their claims are decided speedily and that nothing is done which undermines this policy priority by attracting large numbers of non-genuine applicants to the detriment of genuine applicants. I am satisfied that the structures currently in place provide the State with an asylum system that meets the highest international standards and which allows us to continue to fulfil our international obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention to those seeking asylum. Overloading the process with large numbers of new applicants who come here under the misguided expectation that they will be able to work immediately would be totally contrary to these obligations and could completely negate the major investment in effort, time and resources which has gone into bringing our overall strategy to its current status.</P>

      <P>I assume the document referred to in the question is the Prison Service Strategy Statement 2001-2003, which was published recently. The statement is the first strategy statement to be published by the Prison Service. It defines the mission of the service, the principles which inform its work and the objectives which the service will pursue in the period to end of 2003, including three core objectives of prisoner custody, care and rehabilitation. Copies of the statement are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The following are among the significant features of the statement in regard to the strategic direction of the Prison Service during the period covered by the statement: a commitment to add to the very substantial progress made in recent years in providing an adequate supply of custodial places to accommodate prisoners in decent, modern living conditions; a new emphasis on prisoner rehabilitation involving the delivery of prisoner programmes at all institutions, including programmes specifically addressing offending behaviour. The programmes are to be run, where appropriate, by multi-disciplinary teams of prison officers, probation officers, teachers, psychologists and medical personnel; transition of the Prison Service to agency status, under the guidance of the Prisons Authority Interim Board, in line with Government policy; negotiation of new, more efficient working arrangements for prison staff, and implementation of new, information technology and financial management systems.</P>
      <P>The preparation of new rules for the government of prisons has been under way in my Department for some time. A widespread consultation process has taken place. A request for legal drafting of the proposed rules was forwarded recently to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.

      <P>It is proposed to construct a new area headquarters on the existing Garda station site at Schull and I am informed by the Office Of Public Works that the necessary procedures are currently under way in that office to facilitate this work. Although it is not possible to say at this point when this project will commence, I can assure the Deputy that the matter will be progressed as quickly as overall priorities within the Garda building programme and the availability of financial and other resources allow. Finance is not provided in the Garda Vote of my Department for the construction of Garda stations or, in general, works of a capital nature. Capital works are undertaken by the Office of Public Works and funded from its Vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 444 together.</P>
      <P>Section 9A(1) of the Refugee Act provides for the fingerprinting of asylum applicants over the age of 14. The purpose of fingerprinting is twofold: first, it facilitates the detection of multiple applicants in the State and, second, it is essential for the effective application of the Dublin Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 14,000 sets of fingerprints have been taken since the full commencement of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on 20 November 2000. Almost 6,500 sets of prints have been sent to other member states for comparison under the Dublin Convention. Almost 500 matches have been confirmed to date. Fingerprinting of asylum seekers is being introduced on a phased basis: a semi-automated system, whereby fingerprints are taken manually and processed, stored and matched electronically, was introduced following the full commencement of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended); as soon as possible, a fully automated electronic national fingerprinting system will be developed and introduced which will also <Col N="1451" /> interface with the Eurodac computerised fingerprint database to facilitate the implementation of the Dublin Convention.</P>
    <P>A project board has been established to oversee the development and introduction of the proposed full electronic system. A consultant has also been engaged by my Department to advise on the necessary technical and business requirements for the development which must be compatible with the Eurodac system. His initial report is expected shortly. The expectation is that the full electronic system will be up and running within 12 to 15 months. This will enable us to streamline the system currently being operated and also to fully participate in the Eurodac system being developed at EU level.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the call made by a person (details supplied) for the Government to urgently ratify UN rules on the equalisation of opportunities for people with disabilities; the plans the Government has to ratify these rules; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The UN standard rules on the equalisation of opportunities for persons with disabilities were adopted without a vote on 20 December 1993, at the 85th plenary meeting, of the 48th session of the United Nations General Assembly. The rules are in the form of a General Assembly resolution. As with other such resolutions, there is no mechanism whereby a State can accede to, or ratify it. As a result, the question of ratification by Ireland of the rules does not arise.</P>
      <P>The rules, which number 22 in all, are to a large extent reflected in the 402 recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. This report was published in 1996 and significant progress has been and continues to be made in implementing the report's recommendations. In this connection, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the policy of mainstreaming that was implemented last year, the establishment of the National Disability Authority and Comhairle and the significant legislative and infrastructural framework that has been established to underpin equality, including the Employment Equality Act, the Equal Status Act, the Equality Authority and the Director of Equality Investigations.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to radical change to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families and carers are more fully addressed. In this regard much has been achieved in the disability area since this Government took office and I am committed to continuing the momentum that has been generated and to making further progress in this area.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána is at present actively involved in a new partnership involving local communities called the Community Policing Forum. This model was decided upon, having considered various different models involving community partnership. It is at present being piloted in the Kevin Street district of the Dublin metropolitan area. The objectives of the Community Policing Forum are: to create dialogue between the Garda Síochána and the local community; to seek the views and opinions of the local community with respect to their concerns on crime and policing; to hold formal meetings of the forum; to provide solutions through dialogue and action to concerns raised within an agreed time frame; and to provide formal feedback through ongoing meetings of the forum. The following agencies are involved in the participation the Garda Síochána, local community, public representatives and local authority (Dublin Corporation). Health board representatives will also be invited to attend, as required.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that an independent evaluation is being conducted of the Community Policing Forum. Following an examination of the evaluation report, consideration will be given to replicating this model in other areas should the need be identified.</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána (Promotion) Regulations, 1987, (S.I. No. 39 of 1987) and the Garda Síochána (Promotion) (Amendment) Regulations, 1993, (S.I. No. 27 of 1993) govern the promotion to all ranks up to chief superintendent, while the Garda Síochána (Promotion) (Amendment) Regulations, 2001, <Col N="1453" /> (S.I. No. 392 of 2001) govern the promotion to the rank of assistant commissioner. The position with regard to the different ranks is as follows. Promotion to the ranks of sergeant and inspector is made by the Commissioner. The selection of members for promotion to the ranks of sergeant or inspector is made by means of a competition held by an interview board which includes an interview with each candidate in the competition at a regional interview board followed by an interview with successful candidates at a central interview board. To be eligible to be a candidate for promotion to sergeant or inspector members must have passed the written examination instituted and conducted by the Commissioner in police studies known as the sergeant's promotion examination or the inspector's promotion examination as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Promotion to the ranks of superintendent and chief superintendent is made by the Government on the basis of a recommendation made by the Commissioner. The selection of members for promotion to the rank of superintendent and chief superintendent is made by means of a competition held by an interview board which includes an interview with each candidate in the competition. Promotion to the rank of assistant commissioner is made by the Government on the recommendation of an interview board comprising the Commissioner, who will chair the interview board, a deputy commissioner, a person nominated by the Top Level Appointment's Committee and a person nominated by the Civil Service Commission. The selection process which was recently agreed at the Garda Conciliation Council provides for an interview with each candidate based on stated core competencies. Promotion to the ranks of deputy Commissioner and Commissioner is made by the Government in accordance with the provisions of section 6 of the Police Forces Amalgamation, Act, 1925 (No. 7 of 1925).</P>
      <P>In 1999, a firm of consultants completed a review of the current promotion system for all ranks up to and including chief superintendents. The recommendations contained in their report were approved by the Promotion Advisory Council, which advises the commissioner in relation to promotion systems and procedures. Those recommendations are currently being developed and implemented. It will be necessary to amend the regulations to give affect to some of those recommendations and I will be bringing proposals in this regard to Government in the near future.</P>

      <P>Work is continuing within the European Union on taking forward the plan of action and other conclusions adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council at its meeting on 20 September and by the European Council at its meeting on 21 September. Within the framework of the Council of Ministers, that work includes the questions of the introduction of a European arrest warrant, the adoption of a common definition of terrorism, the preparation of a common European list of terrorist organisations, <Col N="1455" /> the sharing of information with Europol on terrorism measures relating to the freezing of assets and a directive on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering. In relation to freezing of assets, action has already been taken in accordance with EU Regulations giving effect to decisions of the UN Sanctions Committee in appropriate cases. My Department is playing a full and active part in this work and considerable progress has already been made in developing detailed proposals. It is intended that the results of that work will come to the Justice and Home Affairs Council for decision when it meets on 6 and 7 December.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism was signed by Ireland on 15 October 2001. A Bill is at present being prepared in my Department as a matter of urgency which will allow for the early ratification of the Convention by this country. Ireland endorsed the proposals to combat terrorism agreed by Ministers at the special Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 20 September. This included in particular the assignment of national experts on terrorism to a special Europol unit. Ireland has assigned an expert on terrorism from the Garda Síochána to work with this unit in the Hague. A number of proposals to amend the Europol convention to improve the effectiveness of Europol have been put forward. The Council of Ministers agreed recently that a number of these proposals should be examined as a matter of priority. Ireland is participating actively in that process.</P>

      <P>I recently received correspondence from this group and I will respond to it shortly. I agree with the points made by the group on the desirability of children having contact with both parents. Of course, this has to be subject to the overriding consideration that the welfare of the child must be paramount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act, 1987, an unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guard<Col N="1456" /> ian of his child. Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act, 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian. Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a guardian may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child. Examples of such proceedings are applications for custody and access orders. In making such orders and in determining whether an unmarried father should be appointed guardian, the court has to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. These legislative provisions are appropriate as they permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child's upbringing having regard to the child's best interests.</P>

      <P>The introduction of the euro should not, of itself, require any trader to increase prices. Of course, it is open to any business to increase their prices if they want to do so and changes in prices do occur for various reasons and at different times <Col N="1459" /> during the trading year. In a competitive environment this is understandable.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have recognised that the encouragement of a competitive environment and promotion of greater price awareness is a far better way of ensuring value for money for consumers than the imposition of price control legislation which would require that all price adjustments for all products by approved in advance. The introduction of the euro does not change this fact.</P>
      <P>I believe that the vast majority of traders want to behave honourably and fairly during the changeover to the euro. Some unscrupulous traders may seek to use the introduction of the euro as an opportunity to introduce unwarranted price increases. However, the retail market in particular is highly competitive and at the end of the day I believe that the market will punish those who seek to take advantage of the changeover in this way.</P>
      <P>Consumers need to realise the power that they themselves have if they feel they are not being treated fairly, that is simply to take their business elsewhere. The large numbers of traders who have already signed up to the codes of practice on dual display of prices are entitled to display a special logo approved by the Director of Consumer Affairs as evidence of a commitment to carry out the changeover fairly. These traders recognise that it makes good business sense to be in a position to demonstrate to their customers that they have made a commitment not to seek unfair advantage from the changeover. I would encourage consumers to shop where they see this logo displayed. I would also strongly urge retailers in particular who have not yet done so to contact their trade association or the Director of Consumer Affairs without any further delay and sign up to one of the codes of practice on dual display of prices.</P>
      <P>I therefore have no plans to introduce legislation in relation to the euro changeover.</P>

      <P>My Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has specific responsibility for providing information to assist all businesses, including SMEs, with their preparations for the euro currency which will come into being on 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>The EMU Business Awareness Campaign, which is managed by Forfás at the request of this Department, has undertaken this task since it was launched in December 1996. To date the campaign has produced a comprehensive range of publications of relevance to all sectors of the Irish economy which have been widely disseminated to Irish businesses including owners of small businesses.</P>
      <P>Irish pound to euro ready reckoners have already been distributed to many businesses and are available through the Forfás EMU Business Awareness Campaign to any business that wishes to make application for same. These ready reckoners give euro equivalent values of all IR£ amounts from 1p to £250, and in whole pound amounts from £251 to £1,000. A handy IR£ to euro conversion chart is also available through the Forfás campaign.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, whose remit includes providing public and consumer information, is making a euro converter available to all households in the country over the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 171 to 173, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The promotion and development of the Tarbert-Ballylongford landbank is an operational matter for Shannon Development and not a matter in which I as Minister would have any function. As such, I have not had any meetings with Shannon Development or any other bodies or individuals in relation to the development of the landbank </P>
      <P>In relation to grants or other financial incentives available, Ballylongford does not enjoy any special tax designation or tax based incentive and the normal support incentives provided by the Government agencies would be available to any project deemed to be eligible for support. The particular categories through which grant aid might be made available, for example, R&amp;D, training, management development, etc. depends entirely on the nature of the project in question, so it is not possible to say what particular categories would be most commonly used. It follows also that the grant costs per job would be in line with the norms for the particular industry sector involved.</P>
      <P>Although a number of proposals have been advanced over the years regarding the development of the Tarbert-Ballylongford landbank, none has resulted in any development taking place to date. Any proposal for the development of the Tarbert-Ballylongford landbank would, as I have said, be a matter for the board of Shannon Development in the first instance.</P>

      <P>Ireland does not have a formal quota-based migration policy with country or sectoral quotas. The admission of non-EEA personnel is largely market led. The onus is placed on employers to show that no EEA persons were available and willing to do the job. The work permit scheme is unrestricted in terms of the categories or skills of workers for whom applications can be submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of work permits granted under the scheme has increased substantially in recent years <Col N="1462" /> and the number of permits issued in 2001 to date is in excess of 32,000. Because of the way in which our work permit database is structured it is not possible to identify precisely the numbers of permits issued in specialised areas such as information technology which is a sub-set of the services sector. However, in the service sector 12,506 have been issued this year to date while about 600 permits have been issued in respect of the construction sector.</P>
    <P>The working visa-work authorisation scheme has been operating now since June 2000 and in the period up to the end of August 2001 a total of 3,870 permits have been issued for high skilled workers in the IT, construction and nursing professions.</P>
    <P>In light of recent setbacks in the economy and the rising level of domestic unemployment I am concerned that applications for work permits are continuing to increase. The average number of applications per week received over the past eight weeks was in excess of 1,200.</P>
    <P>I will shortly announce modifications to the policy for issuing work permits in order to reflect the changing labour market environment.</P>

      <P>The industrial development agencies fully recognise the need to attract new industry and business into Ballinrobe.</P>
      <P>The task force in Ballinrobe was established in 1999 under the chairmanship of the county manager following the closure of Betatherm. It undertook a study of 35 employees of Betatherm. Of these, 30 responded and of these 30, 17 have found employment. The local employment services group also organised training by FÁS for 14 people in order to assist these people to return to work.</P>
      <P>I understand that the task force will shortly be wound up by the chairman and I will then receive a final report from him.</P>
      <P>The promotion of the 22,000 sq. ft. factory in Ballinrobe is very much a priority for the agencies. However, it is important to realise that the final decision on where any project locates is made by the promoter of a project and not by the agencies.</P>
      <P>When the current factory was completed in 1983, IDA Ireland entered into a 35 year lease with the owner. The current rent payable to the owner is just over £6,000 per month. When the factory is occupied, as was the case with Betatherm, the rent is recouped from the occupier.</P>

      <P>My understanding of the ownership of the site in question is that by deed of surrender and lease dated 22 May 1996 and made between the Minister for Finance of the first part, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources of the second part and Irish Steel Limited of the third part, the property held by Irish Steel Limited on Haulbowline Island was demised to that company for a term of 35 years. Irish Steel Limited was subsequently sold on 30 May 1996 and the company's name changed to Irish Ispat Limited.</P>
      <P>The effect of the deed of 22 May 1996 was to regularise Irish Steel Limited's title to its property on Haulbowline which had formerly been held under several leases granted since 1938 by various Government Departments, all for different terms. In addition, certain lands which the former Irish Steel Limited had occupied on the island had never been the subject of formal leases but were held merely on the basis of oral or written permission from the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Ispat Limited is in voluntary liquidation at present which, I also understand, has an effect <Col N="1466" /> on the lease. This and other matters affecting the leasehold arrangements do not affect my Department but are being dealt with by officials from the Departments of Finance, Defence, and Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    <P>The land immediately adjoining the company's site is in State ownership and is currently in use by the Naval Service.</P>

      <P>The Registration of Business Names Act, 1963, requires, <i>inter alia</i>, that every company carrying on business under a business name that does not consist of its corporate name to have its business name registered with the Companies Registration Office. The penalty on summary conviction for failing to register a business name is £100. Every director, secretary and officer of the company who is knowingly a party to the failure to register will be liable to prosecution. Summary proceedings for offences under the Act may be taken by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>From January to October 2001, statutory redundancy received by some 9,750 workers amounted to £25.1 million. The average amount received was almost £2,600. In the same period, redundancy expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund amounted to £16.5 million, £12.9 million in rebates to employers and £3.6 million directly to employees where employers were unable to make statutory payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> The statutory redundancy scheme is kept under continuous review. With effect from 1 April 2001, and following consultation with the social partners, the ceiling for reckonable earnings was increased from £300 to £400 per week. At present I am considering proposals from a number of organisations, relating to changes to the statutory redundancy scheme.</P>

      <P>Where a company goes into liquidation, employees are entitled to statutory redundancy payments that are related to the number of years' service by the employee. There is no provision whereby workers in companies that go into liquidation would receive a higher level of statutory redundancy than workers let go in companies that continue to trade.</P>
      <P>The Companies Acts contain provisions relating to the ranking of a company's creditors. This provides for certain creditors' claims, including employee wages, to be treated in a preferential manner over other creditors up to a certain limit. It would not, however, be appropriate to give employees a multiple of their actual entitlement as creditor.</P>

      <P>The receivership of St. Patrick's Copper Mines was never completed due to the death of the receiver some years ago. An alternative process of winding up the company which will vest its residual assets in the Minister for Finance, was commenced in recent years. When the receivership of Avoca Mines Limited is completed, its residual assets will revert to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. Part of the lands formerly occupied by Avoca Mines Limited in east Avoca reverted to the Minister under the terms of a reversionary lease.</P>
      <P>As the residual assets of the two companies have not yet formally transferred to the State, they cannot be said, therefore, to be in State ownership at present.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has an inquiry about any particular plot of land, my officials will be glad to clarify as far as possible its ownership status.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>No escapement of 125,000 adult salmon has been reported recently to the Department by any fish farm facility in the Cork-Kerry region. Follow up checks by the Department with all fish farms in the region have confirmed the position. However, I am aware that the South-Western Regional Fisheries Board has received reports of farmed salmon being caught in their area and <Col N="1471" /> they are investigating these reports in co-operation with my Department.</P>
    <P>In general, aquaculture licensing is subject to conditions to ensure good practices and prompt precautionary-remedial action. This includes conditions regarding the prompt reporting of fish escapes to the Department and to the relevant regional fisheries board. The Department is currently undertaking a general review of current containment and recapture measures and practices in operation within the sector with a view to enhancing and strengthening these where practicable.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to pay increases relating to the general operative grades in the fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>In early October 2001 my Department conveyed sanction to the fisheries boards for the payment of the general round increase of 5.5% with effect from 1 October 2001 under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness pay agreement. The Central Fisheries Board informs me that this has already been paid.</P>
      <P>In March 2001 my Department informed the CFB that the revision of pay rates for general operative grades following the Craft Analogue 2000 agreement could be extended to the relevant grades in the fisheries boards subject to agreement on flexibility measures similar to those agreed in other areas of the public service. On 26 September 2001 the CFB formally sought sanction to pay the 2% local bargaining increase provided for under Clause 4 of the Partnership 2000 pay agreement with effect from 1 July 1999 and the craft analogue increase of £19.46 with effect from 1 October 2000. The matter was finalised by my Department following receipt on 5 November 2001 of a commitment from SIPTU regarding a voluntary code of practice on dispute procedures.</P>
      <P>Sanction for both pay increases was conveyed to the CFB on 9 November 2001. The CFB informs me that payment of these increases will commence on Thursday 15 November 2001 and will be completed for all the fisheries boards by end-November 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Fisheries Board informs me that there are no simple criteria which set down minimum standards with regard to water quality and fish. Different fish species respond differently to various pressures. Salmonids &ndash; salmon, trout, char &ndash; are cold water species, 4-150, they require very clean conditions with high oxygen levels and become stressed and more vulnerable to pollutants when temperature rises. Cyprinids or coarse fish &ndash; roach, rudd, bream, carp, eels &ndash; favour higher water temperatures,10-210, can survive lower oxygen levels and are more tolerant of pollution generally.</P>
      <P>Reports on water quality in Ireland are published by the Environmental Protection Agency and the most recent review of the state of the inland waters covers the period 1995 to 1997. There are two main findings in relation to rivers and streams: a continuation of a trend of increasing slight and moderate pollution; a reversal of the trend of decreasing serious pollution which had been gradually falling off over the years.</P>
      <P>The upward trend in the extent of slight and moderate pollution is attributed mainly to eutrophication by organic, animal manure, and artificial fertilisers and to a lesser extent by point source, i.e. sewage, discharges. The slight increase in the extent of seriously polluted channel is attributed mainly to suspected sewage discharges and to a lesser degree to suspected agricultural activities.</P>
      <P>Of the 120 lakes examined in the review period, 81% have been assigned a trophic status, oligotrophic or mesotrophic, consistent with unenriched, satisfactory water quality conditions and a low probability of pollution. The water quality of the remaining lakes examined points to less than satisfactory conditions and the likelihood of significant impairment of beneficial use.</P>

      <P>A number of paramilitary groups, including the Provisional IRA and the UVF, have indicated that they are currently on ceasefire. Both the British and Irish Governments are satisfied that these ceasefires are being maintained.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other paramilitary groups &ndash; the Real IRA, the UDA, the UFF and the LVF &ndash; which have stated that they are on ceasefire and they have not publicly rescinded that claim. However, it is evident that these ceasefires are not being maintained.</P>
      <P>Following the Omagh bombing, the Real IRA announced a &ldquo;complete cessation of all military activity&rdquo; with effect from 7 September 1998. Since then, that organisation has not announced any change to this status and it maintains a strategy of not claiming responsibility for attacks carried out by its members. However, a series of attacks in Northern Ireland and Britain, coupled with evidence gained from arrests, convictions and seizures in this jurisdiction, are indicative of a return to violence by this organisation.</P>
      <P>In relation to loyalist groups, on 12 October, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid, announced that he had specified the UDA, the UFF and the LVF and declared that their ceasefires were over. This decision was made in the light of the involvement of those organisations in a large number of violent incidents over a sustained period of time in many parts of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Those groups which persist in pursuing their aims through violent means &ndash; on both the loyalist and republican sides &ndash; have nothing to offer except death and destruction. The demand of the people on this island, North and South, is that they stop now and for good. I call on all those with influence within the paramilitary organisations not on ceasefire to work for an immediate and complete end to all violent activity.</P>

      <P>Both before and since taking up our position on the UN Security Council, Ireland has sought to highlight the humanitarian dimension of the situation in Afghanistan. This concern is shared throughout the international community and every effort is being made at all levels to meet the humanitarian needs of the vulnerable Afghan population. In October 2000, Ireland Aid gave priority to Afghanistan as a then &ldquo;forgotten emergency&rdquo; with support of £440,000. Since the start of this year, a further £4 million has been provided by the Government in humanitarian assistance to that country. This aid is aimed at meeting the urgent needs of both the vulnerable population within Afghanistan and those who have fled the country, mainly to Pakistan and Iran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During Ireland's Presidency of the UN Security Council in October, we underlined the urgent need to focus on the humanitarian situation in <Col N="1475" /> Afghanistan at the Council's weekly consultations. In particular, we gave priority to both getting aid in place before the onset of winter and keeping borders open to Afghan refugees seeking sanctuary in neighbouring countries. These issues have also been given priority at meetings between the Taoiseach and President Bush. I am also pursuing the humanitarian issues in the context of my ongoing meetings with other Foreign Ministers and senior UN representatives at the current session of the UN General Assembly in New York.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been strongly supportive of a number of special missions which were carried out to countries on Afghanistan's borders and which arose from the consultation process which we spearheaded in October. Visits were paid to the region by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Ruud Lubbers, the UN Secretary General's Special Representative to Afghanistan, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi and by UN Under Secretary General Kenzo Oshima who is responsible for the co-ordination of humanitarian aid within Afghanistan. These special missions have led to improved aid delivery and humanitarian access to Afghanistan through neighbouring countries such as Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgystan. Along with our bilateral efforts on behalf of Irish NGOs, they have also led to an easing of the visa restrictions which had been inhibiting the work of international aid staff.</P>
    <P>An estimated 52,000 tonnes of food aid are needed each month to meet the requirements of the vulnerable people of Afghanistan. The UN agencies, along with the International Red Crescent and the NGO community, are developing a 30-day plan to address urgent needs by region. The Government will continue to support these and other efforts aimed at dealing effectively with the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. We are engaged in ongoing, intense consultations with the key humanitarian and other actors in Washington, New York and Geneva and with those who are delivering aid to the people of Afghanistan with our support.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is the responsible authority for monitoring radon gas levels in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over recent years, the Government has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of radon problems throughout the country and in heightening public awareness of radon. The RPII has carried out a nationwide survey of radon in domestic dwellings involving the <Col N="1476" /> measurement of radon levels in over 11,000 dwellings making it one of the most comprehensive surveys of its kind carried out anywhere in Europe. The results of the survey were used to identify high radon areas &ndash; areas where high radon concentration levels are most prevalent.</P>
    <P>The RPII has also recently completed a three-year nationwide survey of radon levels in all primary and post primary schools. The Minister for Education and Science has made arrangements for all schools found to have radon levels in excess of the reference level for action in schools to be remediated and this remediation work is on-going.</P>
    <P>In 1997, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government introduced upgraded building regulations and related technical guidance documents requiring radon protection measures to be incorporated in all new houses constructed on or after 1 July 1998. Two levels of protection are laid down &ndash; a basic or precautionary level which applies to new dwellings in all parts of the country and a more advanced level which applies to new dwellings in designated high radon areas. Where works are carried out in accordance with the technical guidance documents, this will, <i>prima facie,</i> indicate compliance with the building regulations. A booklet &ldquo;Radon in Buildings&rdquo; produced by the Department of the Environment and Local Government provides advice to householders and builders on radon prevention and remediation measures which can be undertaken in new and existing houses. This booklet is currently being updated by that Department.</P>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000 (S.I. No. 125 of 2000) which I signed last year, and which gave effect to Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 May 1996, on the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers of ionizing radiation applies to all work activities affected by radiation exposure including workplaces where radon is a problem. Under that Order, the RPII has commenced a systematic programme to direct employers to carry out radon measurements in their workplace and to implement radon remediation measures where they are shown to be necessary.</P>
    <P>The RPII provides a radon measurement service to householders and employers and, through its freephone service, its website and publications, provides advice to the general public on radon.</P>
    <P>FÁS, the Training and Employment Authority, in conjunction with local authorities, the RPII and the Department of the Environment and Local Government has developed a comprehensive training programme in radon remediation and prevention. I formally launched this training programme in September this year.</P>
    <P>The Government has already approved the introduction of a radon remediation grant scheme, to be administered by the RPII to assist householders to carry out radon remediation work in respect of their homes and funding for this scheme has been provided in my Depart<Col N="1477" /> ment's Vote for this year. The scheme will be introduced as soon as the necessary legislation is approved by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the resources being applied by the RPII and other Departments and agencies to monitor and control radon gas levels represent a significant investment and that every effort is being made to heighten public awareness of the dangers associated with radon gas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 204 together.</P>
      <P>Last February I published a programme of action for the road haulage industry. This programme resulted from the work of a task force which was established by the Taoiseach to respond to the problems of the road haulage industry and builds on the recommendations of the report A Strategy for the Successful Development of the Irish Road Haulage Industry, published in 1999. The programme of action is designed to make a major contribution to the development of a vibrant road haulage sector which meets the highest professional and safety standards. It identifies a wide range of specific actions to be addressed by various State agencies and the road haulage industry that will increase the professionalisation of the sector and strengthen the enforcement of legislation applying to the road haulage industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A steering group, chaired by my Department, has been set up whose mandate is to ensure rapid implementation of the programme. The group comprises representatives from the Irish Road Haulage Association, the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Finance, the Department of Environment and Local Government, and other interests as appropriate. The work of the steering group was delayed by the foot-and-mouth disease threat in the earlier part of this year. Since this threat receded, the steering group has met on three occasions to address the specific action points set out in the programme of action. Work by the steering group to date has resulted in the establish<Col N="1478" /> ment of an enforcement forum which meets on a regular basis to monitor the effectiveness of the enforcement regime. The level of enforcement checks has been stepped up significantly. Agreement has been reached on a code of practice in relation to the prevention of covert passengers being carried in road haulage vehicles, with a view to combating illegal immigration. Measures are being taken to facilitate a significant increase in the number of transport officers and necessary support staff. Additional funding is being provided during 2001 to assist the Irish Road Haulage Association in fulfilling its role in developing the industry. Work is continuing to progress the other action points of the programme and the steering group will provide a progress report to the Government shortly.</P>

      <P>The Transport Council, at its meeting on 16 October, agreed a horizontal emergency aid package for all European airlines following the events of 11 September. This package essentially consisted of compensation for losses suffered by EU airlines as a result of the four day closure of US airspace from 11 September, coverage for insurance to end of the year and discretion for States to cover additional security costs. Since then, my Department has put arrangements in place in relation to the insurance cover. It has also written to Irish airlines outlining the basis for compensation for the four day closure of US airspace and the criteria to be used in applying for such compensation. Obviously, Aer Lingus will be a major beneficiary as it is the only Irish airline operating on the transatlantic route. However, such compensation will result in a relatively small amount of cash for Aer Lingus in the context of the current crisis.</P>
      <P>In relation to security costs, my officials are in contact with Irish airport companies and airlines to establish the additional security costs attributable to the events of 11 September. I still believe that the compensation measures for all European airlines for the four day closure of US airspace is minimalist and insufficient, given the impact of the terrorist attacks, particularly when you take account of the US aid package. I am continuing to press for an extension of this measure and my officials have formally put the European Commission on notice that we will be making a strong case for the extension of this measure.</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware, from my recent statements to the House, that the European Commission has been unyielding in its view that any State injection of funds into Aer Lingus would be in breach of the State aid rules. In any event, any such proposal would take a minimum of 12 months to be examined by the Commission. Notwithstanding this position of the Commission, my officials are reviewing all competition and State aid rules in consultation with the Attorney General's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I advised the House on 23 October last, the Government has decided in principle that provided the survival plan is rapidly agreed and implemented in all its essential aspects, the Government will facilitate private sector interests <Col N="1480" /> in an investment in Aer Lingus in order to provide a source of funding to support the survival plan. The Government also decided that it should be open to the staff of Aer Lingus to invest further in the airline. My officials are urgently discussing with Aer Lingus management the process involved in implementing both aspects of this decision. Let there be no doubt about this Government's commitment to the survival of Aer Lingus with as many jobs as possible. I would urge all parties to work with me to ensure we reach that objective.</P>

      <P>Far from taking precipitate action, the absolute necessity is for rapid action so that the Aer Lingus survival plan is agreed between the management and staff of the airline by the end of this month. The Aer Lingus survival plan sets out to build a robust, flexible business model to ensure long-term viability by being able to compete successfully in a fundamentally changed marketplace. Its focus is to retain the premier business service together with a simplified economy/leisure product. This plan is the first vital step in securing the future of the company with as many jobs as possible. It will also provide a basis from which the company can grow in the future when markets improve.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus has responded to the fall-off in passenger numbers as a result of the events of 11 September by introducing fare sales to stimulate traffic on all its routes. There has been a substantial uptake of the reduced fares which has halted the rate of decline in passenger numbers. However, the average yield earned from these passengers is significantly below last years level.</P>

      <P>On 25 October 2001, the Irish Government initiated legal action against the UK under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in regard to the Sellafield MOX plant. The purpose of the legal action is to prevent the operation of the MOX plant and international movements of radioactive materials in and around the Irish Sea associated with the operation of the MOX plant.</P>
      <P>In summary, the Irish Government has initiated these proceedings on the grounds that the UK has violated numerous provisions of UNCLOS. The Irish Government considers that the UK has failed to co-operate with Ireland by withholding information on the MOX plant; that the UK has failed to carry out a proper environmental impact assessment of the plant and associated transportation of radioactive materials and that by permitting new discharges of radioactive materials into the Irish Sea, it has violated its obligations to protect the marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this action, Ireland has requested the establishment of an international arbitration tribunal, viz., the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) to resolve the case. Pending the convening of the Tribunal to consider the case and any decision from the Tribunal, the Irish Government has, in the last few days, requested ITLOS to order an immediate suspension of the UK's authorisation of the MOX plant and associated international transports of radioactive materials. A hearing on this request is commencing in Hamburg next week. The international proceedings under UNCLOS are separate from the legal proceedings under the OSPAR Convention which the Irish Government initiated some months ago against the UK in regard to the same <Col N="1482" /> plant and which I referred to in my reply to Question No. 110 on 25 October 2001.</P>

      <P>Aer Rianta has assured me that there is no difference in the treatment of Shannon and Cork Airports as far as their newly expanded incentive scheme is concerned, i.e., the same scheme applies for new routes developed into both of these airports. Following the dramatic downturn in the global aviation sector as a result of the terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September, I requested Aer Rianta to consider initiatives to sustain and grow traffic at the three State Airports. Aer Rianta responded positively to my request by offering a range of new incentives, commencing on 1 October 2001, to airlines which launch new routes into Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports. The Company improved its incentive schemes at Shannon and Cork by increasing the period for zero airport charges for new routes from three to four years. Aer Rianta also extended this scheme to Dublin Airport where there will be no airport charges levied on airlines for new routes for a period of three years. In addition, Aer Rianta will provide marketing support for route development promotional activities. I very much welcome these initiatives on the part of Aer Rianta. They are intended to help reduce the impact of the current global aviation downturn on traffic at the State airports and to boost the Irish aviation and tourism sectors in the months and years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a slow down in the development of the communications network over the last twelve months in Ireland. This has been brought about by a slow down internationally in the financing of the communications industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in recent years put in place a number of initiatives under national policy, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly by bringing broadband con<Col N="1483" /> nectivity to regional and rural areas. Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, 26 million (IR£20 million) was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled-out broadband nationwide were supported and are now nearing completion. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives has been significantly increased to 200 million (IR£147 million).</P>
    <P>A first call for proposals was run last year and, on foot of submissions received, nine contracts are being implemented resulting in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. At the beginning of August this year I announced the second call for proposals. The deadline for receipt of proposals was 19 October. Again 55 million (IR£43 million) is available to promote the investment in communications infrastructure. Three programme lines are supported under the present invitation to tender &ndash; commercial broadband rollouts; commercial DSL rollout and public projects with economic development and social objectives. Details of this programme are available at www.ndpcomms.gov.ie.</P>
    <P>As a result of this second call, 31 proposals have been received. Twenty of these proposals are applications made by local authorities/public bodies. The other 11 are proposals from private sector companies. The proposals are being evaluated by an independent evaluation committee, according to the criteria set out in the invitation to tender document. I have recently invited expressions of interest in building, financing and operating the Atlantic broadband corridor network. These expressions of interest will be sought from the home and international markets. The responses to that invitation will give me a fuller indication of cost, scale, time-line and so forth.</P>

      <P>The Government signed a contract with Global Crossing on 2 July 1999 to provide, by mid 2000, seamless access to a high capacity telecommunications network spanning Ireland, 36 European cities and the US for 77,625,400 (approximately £61 million). The network was completed on 26 August 2000 and was capable of delivering the entire 160 STMs (an STM is the ability to transfer data at 155Mb/s) contracted for in addition to the optional 80 STMs provided for under the agreements with Global Crossing. My Department and the IDA entered into contracts with a number of private sector companies to acquire this capacity and thus ensure that the benefits are passed on to the Irish market. Four companies (Eircom, Chorus, Metromedia and <Col N="1484" /> Worldport) are currently contracted to use 73 STMs for 38,435,422 (£30,270,355) and 7 STMs have been transferred to the national research network, HEAnet. My Department and the IDA are actively involved in the resale of the remaining 80 STMs. The contract with Global Crossing was further enhanced in May of this year and companies may now swap Dublin-New York capacity for traffic to U.S. cities such as Boston, Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco. Also available is sub-STM traffic in Europe as well as bandwidth to Tokyo and Hong Kong. The operation and maintenance charges were also reduced on European capacity from $90,000 per annum to 60,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>In an additional initiative, a study was undertaken on behalf of my Department to consider options on addressing certain communications infrastructure gaps throughout the country and to promote competition and reduce the price of broadband services in the West of Ireland. On foot of this study, I sought expressions of interest in designing, building, operating and managing a seamless, world class, high speed telecommunications network linking Northwest to Southwest Ireland, with interconnectivity to existing national networks. The deadline for receipt of these expressions of interest in an Atlantic broadband corridor was 31 October 2001. My officials are currently evaluating the expressions of interest received.</P>

      <P>The provision of telecommunications services including broadband services is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. My understanding is that broadband services in Counties Cavan and Monaghan are provided primarily by Eircom. Information available indicates that both Monaghan town and Cavan town have optical fibre nodes and SDH switches on the eircom network. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives, which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly by bringing broadband connectivity to regional and rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, 200 million (IR£157 million) have been made available for the roll-out of broadband networks. A first call for proposals was run last year and on foot of submissions received nine contracts which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure. The projects involved will be completed over the next two years and will entail overall investment of <Col N="1485" /> 160 million (IR£ 126 million) in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately 55 million (IR£43 million). Among these contracts is the building of a new fibre-optic network by ESB, which will pass through the CavanMonaghan area. A second call for proposals is under way with projects sought from local authorities, and I hope to announce additional projects in the new year.</P>

The programme of action for the road haulage industry, published by me in February last, provides for a number of specific measures by various State agencies to improve the level of compliance with legislation across the road haulage sector. An enforcement forum has been set up under the programme to monitor the effectiveness of the enforcement regime. The forum is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives from the Irish Road Haulage Association, the Revenue Commissioners, the Gardai, the Department of Justice and Law Reform, and the Department of Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>As part of the programme, the level of enforcement checks has been stepped up significantly and a targeted blitz of certain areas and industries, including the concrete and construction industries, is under way. In addition, arrangements are being made to increase the number of enforcement officers and support staff in my Department by 50%. I believe these enforcement measures by my Department, and those of other agencies will significantly improve the level of compliance with licensing, tachograph and other legislation governing the road haulage industry.</P>

      <P>A vitally important component of the Aer Lingus survival plan is the redundancy programme for which 50.79 million (£40 million) will be made available by the company through the sale of aircraft and borrowings. The company advise that this is the absolute maximum they can afford if the airline is to have any prospect of surviving. The redundancy package allows for an average of four weeks pay for every year of service which is considerably in excess of statutory redundancy payments. The company has indicated that the deadline for receipt of applications for the redundancy package is 30 November 2001. In the negotiations that are now under way between management and unions in Aer Lingus, it is a matter for those parties to negotiate whether the severance package costing 50.79 million (£40 million) can accommodate an element of early retirement in addition to redundancy payments.</P>
      <P>I am only aware of one case where an EU Government contributed towards the pension fund of an airline. I understand that in 1995, the European Commission investigated plans by the German Government to contribute to pension funds concerning Lufthansa employees as part of the company's privatisation programme. The measures were linked to Lufthansa withdrawal from a supplementary pension fund managed by the VBL<i> (Versorgungsanstalt des Bundes und der Laender)</i>, to which as a public company it had been obliged to belong but as a private company was obliged to leave. This proposal was challenged by the European Commission for its compatibility with State aid rules. The Commission decided not to raise any objections on the basis that a private investor in the same position as the German Government would very probably have acted in the same way and the injection was therefore found to be compatible with State aid rules.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office strategy 2000-2016, A Platform for Change, which is due to be published shortly in its final form, will recommend the provision of a rail spur from the Maynooth line to Navan (<i>via </i>Clonsilla and Dunboyne) by 2010. The strategy is currently <Col N="1487" /> under consideration by Iarnród Eireann, from whom I have not yet received proposals in that regard. It would therefore be premature to make projections on costings at this stage. In the meantime, Iarnród Éireann informs me that the company has been co-operating with Meath County Council to ensure that the projected alignment is preserved free from development.</P>

      <P>Iarnród Éireann informs me that the stated objective of the DASH project is to increase the carrying capacity of the DART and coastal suburban rail services from 11,800 per hour to 21,100 per hour. When completed, the city centre network will be able to deal with longer trains at increased frequency through Connolly and Pearse Stations at peak periods. The works will involve additional trackwork and the upgrading of signalling and power supply, as well as increasing platform lengths to facilitate 8-car trains on the DART network. The design and planning work for the DASH project is proceeding and it is anticipated that this phase of the project will be completed in the near future. When completed, it will then be possible to determine a completion date in the light of funding from CIE's own resources and the Exchequer. A sum of £7.2 million (9.14 million) in Exchequer funding has been allocated in respect of this project in 2001. The allocation of Exchequer funding to the project in 2002 will be decided in the context of the Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person in question was injured in a road traffic accident in June 1955 while on duty as a member of the FCA. He instituted civil proceedings against the owner of the car involved in the accident and he received compensation of £2,500.</P>
      <P>He also applied for compensation under the terms of the Emergency Powers (Compensation for Personnel Injuries) (Local Defence Forces) Scheme, 1942, and was found eligible for an award of periodic compensation under the scheme. However, no payments were actually made to him because the relevant amount of periodic compensation was less than the actuarial value of the compensation which he had received. His case was kept under review and he was re-examined on a number of occasions by the Army Pensions Board. When he was called for a further medical examination in 1962, the correspondence addressed to him was returned to the Department with the endorsement &ldquo;gone away&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Nothing was heard from the individual until 30 years later when he made contact with the Department's Renmore office and a letter was issued to him in May 1991 clarifying the points raised. There was no further contact with him until earlier this year when he sought access to the departmental files relating to his case. He was provided with copies of those papers and, in May 2001, the Deputy put down a parliamentary question concerning the case. In the course of my reply to that question (No. 134 of 29 May), I outlined the background to the case and undertook to have it reviewed.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the person was examined by the Army Pensions Board and the board reported to the Department. Following consideration of the case in the Department, an award of periodic compensation has been made to the individual in question. In view of the unusual circumstances of the case, it was concluded in the Department that some degree of retrospection was warranted and it was decided to backdate the award for a period of six years (as had been done in other cases over the years). In that context, it was also decided that the actuarial value of the civil compensation received by the person should not be deducted from the periodic compensation. The Department wrote to the person on 31 October outlining the position and enclosed a substantial payment covering the retrospective period.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 211, 237 and 239 together.</P>
      <P>Throughout the discussions on the reform of the sheep meat regime, I have sought support for the fixed premium to be set at a level, which ensures a reasonable income for Irish sheep producers and bears some relationship with the premium payable in other sectors. I have also raised the question of the introduction of an extensification premium for sheep producers. My aim is to ensure that the best possible support regime is put in place for Irish sheep producers.</P>
      <P>During 2001, I have also sought to convince Commissioner Fischler and my colleagues in the Council of the validity of Ireland's case both at meetings of the Agriculture Council and in the internal discussions with other ministers. In this context, I have discussed the reform of the sheep meat regime with the Swedish, Spanish, Belgian and UK ministers for agriculture. The dates and locations of these meetings were as follows. I met the Swedish Minister, Mr. Winberg, on 15 January 2001 in Dublin. I met the Spanish Minister, Mr. Arias Canete, on 6 February 2001 in Dublin. I met the Belgian Minister, Mr. Gabriels, on 26 June 2001 in Dublin. I met the British Minister, Margaret Beckett, on 18 October 2001 in London.</P>
      <P>My officials have also had ongoing discussions on the issue with their EU counterparts.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the slaughter of reactor animals <Col N="1490" /> under my Department's disease eradication schemes.</P>
      <P>The procedure for disposing of reactor animals operates on the basis that meat factories tender on a weekly basis for the slaughter of these animals and the district veterinary office selects the meat factories which are most financially beneficial in the prices that they offer for different types of animals.</P>
      <P>The compensation for reactor animals comprises: the salvage value of the animal, which is paid by the factory directly to the farmer and a reactor grant, or valuation less the salvage value, paid to the farmer by my Department.</P>
      <P>At all times the ownership of the reactor animal continues to reside with the farmer and therefore the contract for the salvage value is a matter between the farmer and the meat factory involved. My Department's responsibility is to ensure the secure removal of the animal to slaughter and to pay the appropriate compensation.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances where a factory goes out of business, such as has happened in the case in question, the recovery of any monies due to losses incurred by farmers is a matter for resolution between themselves and the company's liquidators.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions attached to this category was that the off-farm income of the applicant, including any off-farm income of his spouse or partner, should not exceed £10,000. The person named declared that he had an off-farm income of £19,260 and that his spouse or partner had an off-farm income of £9,097, making a total off-farm income of £28,357.

A condition of the new scheme is that applicants must meet a minimum stocking level of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare in the year preceding application.

The person named was not a headage recipient in 2000 and, according to my Department's records, the stocking density of the holding does not meet the minimum requirement. My Department wrote to the person named on 7 November 2001 with a view to establishing the type of farming activity being pursued. A decision on entitlement to area-based compensatory allowance will be made on receipt of reply.</P>

      <P>Firstly, 10% of the available quota was reserved for farmers in the Cooley peninsula who had to de-stock as a result of the foot and mouth crisis in that area.</P>
      <P>The remaining quota would be allocated to eligible applicants in the following categories in order of priority &ndash; farmers under 35 years of age who will apply for the suckler cow premium scheme for the first time in 2002; farmers with holdings on off shore islands (5% of the available quota was reserved for this category); organic farmers who are registered with the Department (10% of the available quota was reserved for this category) and farmers who have applied regularly for the suckler cow premium scheme and who require additional quota to ensure the future viability of their holdings.</P>

      <P>The applicant in this case applied on 26 June 2001 for 16 cows and four heifers under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme for small scale milk suppliers. According to the scheme's terms and conditions, applicants must have a milk quota of less than 32,478 gallons on 31 March 2001-1 April 2001. They must give undertakings not to increase their milk quotas either temporarily or permanently to 32,478 or more gallons during an unbroken 12 months period starting in each case on the day the application is received by the Department and must comply with that undertaking. They must have suckler cows surplus to the cows needed to produce those quotas. Where the producer is not in an official milk recording scheme the number of notional dairy cows needed to produce the milk quota is that quota divided by 876 gallons. The person named holds a milk quota of 30,139 gallons &ndash; this includes 1,300 gallons allocated from the national reserve in July 2001. He has 44 cows in total, 34.40 of those are required to fill the milk quota leaving a balance of 9.6 cows eligible for payment of suckler cow premium and 2.4 heifers &ndash; 25% of eligible cows. Payment issued in accordance with these terms and conditions on 26 October 2001 for 12 animals, his full 80% entitlement under the 2001 suckler cow premium scheme.</P>

      <P>On 7 October, I announced that the Egyptian authorities had that day published a decree to extend the existing European wide ban, but in a major development provided for an exemption for countries with BSE controls of the type operated by Ireland. This represented a major breakthrough which prepared the way for the long awaited reopening of the Egyptian market for Irish beef and fol<Col N="1499" /> lowed intensive contact at political, diplomatic and technical level over the past number of months between Ireland and Egypt. The decree relates specifically to beef and does not provide for the resumption of the live cattle trade.</P>
      <P>Since then, contacts have been taking place between our embassy in Cairo and the Egyptian authorities on matters relating to certification, specification and terms of supply. Commercial contacts have also taken place between importers and the authorities in Egypt. Within the past number of days, the Egyptian authorities have taken a further step and have formally published a list of three countries, one of which is Ireland, which meet the required criteria.</P>
      <P>A number of applications for import licences have, I understand, already been submitted to the Egyptian authorities. The question then of competing for contracts is a commercial matter for the exporters involved and it is not possible at this stage to say what volumes will be exported in 2001. I am, naturally, hopeful that Irish companies will compete to regain the level of market share they enjoyed in recent years in this important market.</P>

Included in the payment was an additional amount of £288.52 under a compensation package agreed with the European Commission for farmers experiencing losses under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme. The additional sum is equal to 90% of the difference between the average sum of the headage payments under the 1998, 1999 and 2000 headage schemes and the amount arising under the 2001 area-based compensatory allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>The overall area has now increased to 44.10 hectares on the area aid system, made up of 30.06 hectares of more severely handicapped lowland and 14.10 hectares of less severely handicapped lowland.

Since this is more than his average payment of £2,523.73 over the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, no compensation is payable. As he has already been paid compensation of £288.52, he will be paid a balance of £458.48 &ndash; £747 less £288.52 &ndash; within the next three weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The process of drying and pelletising manure is expensive and, therefore, on the basis of research and experience in other European countries, its widespread use at farm level is unlikely. My Department has had ongoing discussions over recent years with the farming organisations about a number of issues relating to the environment, including the issue of raising awareness of potential water quality problems associated with the land-spreading of manure. My Department is currently in discussion with the farming organisations about proposals by Dúchas to designate river margin areas as special areas of conservation under the Habitats Directive.</P>
      <P>The adoption of good manure management practices is a key requirement of farmers who participate in the rural environment protection scheme &ndash; REPS. Participation by over 45,000 farmers in the first REP scheme significantly reduced the danger of water pollution caused by slurry spreading, and with participation projected to reach 70,000 in 2006, this trend will continue. Approximately 25,000 applicants are expected to avail of the capital investment grants under the farm waste management scheme in the period 2000-06.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently published a booklet on good farming practice, which includes specific requirements on nutrient management and the protection of watercourses and wells. Farmers are also required to comply with their responsibilities under environmental legislation. Compliance with good farming practice is compulsory for all farmers claiming aid under the direct payment schemes operated by my Department, and therefore over 100,000 farmers will be subject to it in the period to 2006.</P>

      <P>Under my Department's farm waste management scheme it is the function of the agricultural consultant-advisers who prepare applications for farmers to calculate slurry storage requirements on holdings. The requirements are to be calculated in accordance with guidelines on slurry storage requirements for different classes of livestock issued by my Department and local authority by laws where applicable. I am not aware of any study carried out on the size and capacity of the slurry tanks grant-aided by my Department. The question of how and when to dispose of slurry is a matter of good management and all farmers availing of grant aid under the relevant schemes operated by my Department must undertake to observe the guidelines laid down in the code for good farming practice. This includes the proper disposal of slurry.</P>

      <P>In 2000 the State laboratory received approximately 1,500 samples for analysis under the Coroners Acts. Indications are this figure will be exceeded in 2001. Post-mortem samples from autopsies are analysed to assist the coroners to establish the cause of death in cases of sudden death. In the case of simpler analyses the samples are usually returned to coroners &ndash; and copied to hospital pathologists &ndash; within two to three weeks. Where more complex analyses are required, the average turn-around time is three to four months because a number of discrete steps must be taken in sequence. In the case in question, samples were received in mid-August and a report is expected by the end of November.</P>

      <P>If the bands as they existed prior to the Finance Act, 2000, were restored, i.e. to £14,000 for single and widowed persons and £28,000 for all married couples, this would provide additional revenue to the Exchequer of £909 million in a full year based on projected 2002 incomes.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 to 264, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for ensuring that administrative stream posts are filled by persons with appropriate skills, including where necessary, finance and accountancy skills, rests primarily with individual Departments. Their selection and training policies must be directed towards ensuring a satisfactory supply of suitably skilled staff. On some occasions the needs of the work may require the <Col N="1509" /> hiring of accountants and other specialist professionals. On other occasions it may instead be more appropriate to utilise or update the skills of general service personnel. My Department of course does have an important support role to play in this area. A key contribution in recent times has been our lead role in the design and launch of the performance management and development system. This system, which is aimed at securing improved employee performance and career development, places a strong emphasis on training and upskilling, allowing managers and staff to continuously update job-relevant knowledge and capabilities.</P>
    <P>With regard to cross-stream promotion, I know that many civil servants in professional career streams, including accountants, may wish to compete for promotion to general service principal officer posts, in particular by means of the interdepartmental principal officer scheme. In 1997 my Department entered talks with IMPACT, which represents these professionals, and with the Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants which represents equivalent general service personnel. The talks focused on a possible new interdepartmental promotion scheme which would allow officers in either category compete for some principal-level posts in each other's career streams. Despite commitments to the idea of such cross-stream movement from both unions under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>  1994-1997, it proved difficult to get agreement on a scheme which would be acceptable to both sides, and in 1999 IMPACT withdrew from the talks. In the circumstances, my Department then had little option at this time but to proceed with an interdepartmental principal-level scheme whose candidature did not include accountants or other professional grades.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department remains committed to the concept of cross-stream promotion and will continue to work towards the removal of existing structural rigidities and divisions. I might add however that the current absence of cross-stream movement between professional and general service grades at interdepartmental level does not mean that such movement cannot occur within departments, but any such initiative would be a matter for individual departments in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that an income tax liability for the individual in question for the year 1999-2000 of £9,988.48 together with interest of £1,897.72 was referred to the sheriff for <Col N="1510" /> collection on 15 June 2001, following the person's failure to make payment despite being reminded by Revenue of his obligation to do so. The interest accrued in the normal way from 1 November 1999, because the person concerned failed to pay the correct amount of preliminary tax for the year in question. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the sheriff has, taking account of the person's financial circumstances, accepted a phased payment of the debt.</P>
      <P>Interest payable on late payment of tax is not allowed as a deduction in computing the amount of income, profits or other gains that are chargeable to any tax. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is not possible, therefore, for the interest charged to be credited to or against the tax liability for 2000-2001 or subsequent years.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Central Bank that, as at 8 November 2001, the circulation of Irish notes was some 170 million bank notes worth some £3,500 million, and of coins was some 2,730 million coins worth some £305 million. By circulation is meant, briefly, cash held outside the Central Bank and cash centres, i.e. in branches of financial institutions and by retailers, as well as by the general public. While the bank note circulation is for the most part regularly replaced, coins are not: the figure for coins therefore includes coins that were issued a long time ago, many of which may by now have been lost, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland's cash changeover plan for 2002, which I published in April 2000, states that on 1 January 2002, e-day, <Col N="1512" /> euro notes and coins will begin to be put into circulation and the withdrawal of Irish notes and coins will begin. Legal tender status will be withdrawn from Irish notes and coins at midnight on Saturday, 9 February 2002.</P>
    <P>From then on, such notes and coins will not have to be accepted in payment. However, exchange of Irish cash for euro as set out in the plan, and acceptance of lodgements of Irish cash, by banks, building societies, post offices and, where feasible, by credit unions for members, will continue for a time after 9 February 2002; also, the Central Bank will continue indefinitely to give value in euro for Irish notes and coins. These provisions are set out in the handbook on the changeover to the euro which the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, ECBI, has been distributing to every household. In addition, the ECBI, the Central Bank of Ireland and various charities have for some time been running campaigns to urge the public to release any hoarded coins.</P>

      <P>It is a basic principle of Government procurement that a procedure based on competitive tendering should be used unless exceptional circumstances apply. Contracts are advertised in newspapers, on the national procurement website, or a number of contractors, sufficient to ensure effective competition, may be invited to submit tenders directly where appropriate. In general, with contracts of lower value a less formal procedure is appropriate.</P>
      <P>EU public procurement directives apply to contracts above certain thresholds. Under these directives there is an obligation on contracting authorities to advertise contracts in the Official Journal of the European Communities and to follow specific tendering procedures.</P>

    <P>The EU threshold for works contracts is 5.3 million or £4.2 million. For service and supply contracts of Departments and offices the threshold is 139,312 or £109,717. For other public bodies the threshold is 214,326 or £168,795. In <Col N="1513" /> the utilities sector the threshold for most service and supplies contracts is 428,653 or £337,592.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a school for special needs children (details supplied) in County Limerick has been without a speech and language therapist since April of this year; if his attention has further been drawn to the difficulties the school is experiencing in filling the post; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[28028/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Mid-Western Health Board that the board is finding it extremely diffi<Col N="1516" /> cult to recruit speech and language therapists. With particular reference to the school in question this post, along with other posts in this area, has been advertised nationally and in the UK. These recruitment campaigns have been unsuccessful. A recruitment agency has been engaged by the board to broaden the search for therapists nationally and internationally, with the objective of speeding up the recruitment process. Filling posts which provide speech and language therapy to school age children with an intellectual disability is a priority for the board.</P>
      <P>While significant additional resources have been made available to the health boards in recent years to enhance the level of health-related support services available to children with disabilities, the boards and other service providers have been encountering difficulties in both recruiting and retaining the allied health professionals necessary to deliver the various therapy services.</P>
      <P>In acknowledgement of these difficulties, my Department has asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to explore other possibilities with a view to facilitating as many children as possible to access the necessary support services. This might include the purchase of additional sessions which may result in either the maintenance of the existing levels of service provision or an enhancement in line with agreed service developments, using the resources which have been allocated for these services. It is a matter however for each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to determine what additional measures the service in their region might undertake to facilitate this access.</P>
      <P>Another measure which has been taken to assist parents in this area is Section 8 of the Finance Act 2001, which amends section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to extend tax relief for medical expenses to cover the cost of educational psychological assessment and speech and language therapy services for children.</P>
      <P>My Department commissioned Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a work force planning study which has just been published. This study was undertaken to examine and quantify the existing and future demand for therapy grades, including speech and language therapists. It concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years requiring a significant increase in training places. An inter-agency group, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority has been created to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. The other key recommendations relating to addressing the shortfall in supply are also being addressed within my Department.</P>

      <P>The Irish Medical Organisation continues to query the interpretation of that part of the NCHD 2000 Agreement which deals with overtime. As I have previously stated, both I and my officials have attempted, on several occasions, to resolve this matter with the IMO. Throughout this period I have requested that the matter be referred to the Labour Relations Commission for its considered view. Both the HSEA and the Department of Health and Children agree to accept the outcome of such clarification by the LRC. I am anxious to have this issue resolved at an early date. I wish to highlight again the fact that £90 million in additional funding has been allocated to NCHDs in the current year. There has been and will continue to be very significant investment in the terms and conditions applicable to NCHDs.</P>

      <P>In my parliamentary reply to the Deputy on the 23 October 2001, I advised that detailed discussions are taking place at present involving the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, and my Department concerning the implications, including resources, of the proposed new directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. The draft directive is about setting EU standards of quality of safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of blood and blood components. It is an important EU initiative which is supported by the IMB, IBTS and my Department. Resources necessary to implement the provisions of the directive will be made available. The proposed new directive is a major item for discussion at the Council of Health Ministers meeting on 15 November 2001. It is not anticipated that the directive will be in force before the end of 2002.</P>

      <P>Best practice in the management of hospitals is an area which must be kept under review to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in delivery of service to patients. In this regard, my Department has been endeavouring to involve clinicians in the management process of hospitals and creating an environment where clinicians and administrators can engage in a positive manner for the benefit of patient care. In addition organisational management structures and their role in supporting the planning and delivery of services have been given careful consideration in the course of the preparation of the forthcoming health strategy.</P>

The Government also approved the establishment of a national task force on medical manpower to, <i>inter alia, </i>prepare a detailed implementation programme based on the recommendations of the report of the medical manpower forum and the requirement for a phased reduction in NCHD working hours under the EU working time directive &ndash; Council Directive 93/104/EC and 2000/34/EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the forum on medical manpower stated that the &ldquo;patient is entitled to the highest quality service within the available resources and resources must be used in the most efficient and effective manner possible&rdquo;&ndash; section 3.1, page 15. The task force will engage in a detailed quantification of the resource implications, the number of staff and the costs involved. It is envisaged that the task force will hold its inaugural meeting shortly. Following quantification by the task force of the resources and costs, I will bring proposals to Government regarding the appropri<Col N="1519" /> ate measures to take, the timeframe associated and the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that health is a key priority for this Government. The Government is committed to the implementation of the EU working time directive and has already approved the commencement of negotiations on a new contract for hospital consultants with the relevant medical organisations. Matters to be addressed include the core issues arising from the forum report and the report of the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, including flexibility/cover arrangements, team working, etc. and the issues highlighted in Report No. 38 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Service.</P>

      <P>The introduction of enterprise liability as the basis for providing indemnity cover for hospitals and doctors provides a unique opportunity to introduce a national system for the collection and analysis of data on the clinical incidents which can adversely affect patients and potentially lead to claims for compensation. On several occasions I have indicated my support for this concept as it has the potential to make a significant contribution to enhancing patient safety.</P>

      <P>Non-consultant hospital doctors &ndash; NCHDs &ndash; are doctors in training, who require a significant amount of training time, on the job and through designated training hours, to complete their medical training and equip them to advance to consultant appointments. It is also appropriate that all doctors receive continuing medical education &ndash; CME &ndash; in order to stay abreast of new developments and for the purposes of competence assurance.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, an appraisal of medical education and training will be a key aspect of the work of the forthcoming national task force on medical manpower. Among the issues which the task force will be asked to examine are the recommendations of the forum on medical manpower and the national joint steering group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors.</P>
      <P>These include a training strategy for each hospital, the development of training partnerships with UK and US hospitals and the accreditation of training placements abroad. The task force will also examine proposals for increased opportunities for continuing medical education and continuing professional development in modular form and the development of joint strategies for delivery of CME and CPD involving employers and training bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to ensure that women have available to them education and training oppor<Col N="1521" /> tunities equal to those available to men and to this end, the forthcoming national task force on medical manpower will, <i>inter alia, </i>prepare detailed proposals to address gender imbalances in the hospital medical staffing system. Most importantly, the task force will assess how career progression and development for doctors can be linked to evidence-based assessment of performance and the need for competence assurance procedures and audit for both service delivery and training.</P>

      <P>Prior to the launch, on 4 October, of the report of the national advisory committee on palliative care, I allocated £3 million &ndash; 3.81 million &ndash; to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to begin implementing the report's recommendations. This brings the total allocation in 2002 to £5.625 million &ndash; 7.14 million. The additional funding will be used to, <i>inter alia</i>, allow health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to undertake needs assessment studies to identify palliative care needs; establish a regional consultative committee and a regional development committee; and to examine the creation of a post which would deal with the development of palliative care services.</P>
      <P>The needs assessment studies are fundamental in order to ensure efficient and effective service development. They will estimate the current level of service provision in each area, identify gaps in the service, and determine the priorities for future service development within all care settings, in line with the recommendations of the report of the national advisory committee on palliative care. Once the above objectives have been met further recommendations can begin to be implemented depending on the priority attached by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the situation where, even though 55% of medical graduates from 1993 onwards were female, only 2% of consultant surgeons are female and only 18% of consultants are female; the reason therefor; and the plans he has to correct this gender imbalance.</Quest>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the report of the Forum on Medical Manpower, published in April of this year, deals extensively with the issue of gender balance in medical staffing. There has been some improvement recently on the figures outlined by the Deputy. Published figures from the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board and Comhairle na nOspidéal indicate that as of January 2001, women made up 37% of junior doctors, 21% of consultants and 4%, up from 2%, of consultant surgeons; a significant improvement on the figures noted by the Deputy. Representation of women doctors is growing at all levels in the majority of medical specialties.</P>
      <P>It is important, however, to ensure that women have available to them career prospects equal to those available to men and to this end, the forthcoming National Task Force on Medical Manpower will, <i>inter alia,</i> prepare detailed proposals to address gender imbalances in the hospital medical staffing system. The task force will also be examining the number of places in medical colleges and the system of hospital medical education and training with the aim of providing high quality postgraduate training and career opportunities for all medical staff &ndash; male and female.</P>

      <P>The Irish Medical Organisation &ndash; IMO &ndash; has demanded resolution of a range of issues as a precondition to its participation in the national task force on medical manpower. Despite numerous contacts, at meetings, by telephone and in writing, with me and with officials of my Department since April in an attempt to clarify and address these concerns, the IMO has still not agreed to come on board with the other stakeholders. This issue has unfortunately delayed the establishment of the task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my strong preference would be to establish the task force on the basis of participation by all the stakeholders from the outset, I am conscious of the critical national importance of the task force's remit to oversee key health service reforms aimed at resolving long-standing structural problems in relation to medical workforce planning in our hospitals. The appropriate forum <Col N="1526" /> for addressing the IMO's principal concerns is within the task force. I have recently conveyed to the IMO my strong view that it has an opportunity to join with all the stakeholders in making a significant contribution within the task force. I have requested the organisation to review its stance in light of the numerous clarifications provided to them regarding their concerns and bearing in mind the importance attached to this process, which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>There is a platelet donor programme in place in the National Blood Centre at St James's Hospital. The centre also provides facilities for autologous donations i.e. where prospective patients may pre-deposit their own blood prior to surgery. The Irish Blood Transfusion Service also plans to collect whole blood donations at the centre on an appointment basis.</P>
      <P>A new fixed donation clinic is in operation in D'Olier Street. This is a clinic where people can drop in and donate blood without prior appointment. It is conveniently located to many of the main bus routes and where there are high numbers of people at all times. This clinic has proved to be extremely successful and is supplemented by mobile clinics at various locations throughout the city.</P>

It is expected that the two new units in the Northern and East Coast Area Boards will be fully operational by March 2002. I will continue to monitor the situation in relation to these new arrangements and anticipate that this initiative will be successful in dealing with the delays currently being experienced by the couples in the region. I have been advised by the ERHA that a letter is being sent to all applicants informing them of both the current and new arrangements including their position on the regional waiting list.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received an explanation from the Irish Blood Transfusion Service giving the reasons for it shelving plans to curb blood donations from donors who lived in the UK for a year or more due to the fear that it would lead to an immediate and acute blood shortage; and the status of the concern.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 31 March 2001, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service &ndash; IBTS &ndash; has deferred all donors who have spent five years or more in the UK between 1980 and 1996. This deferral has resulted in the loss of 5% of donors. Prior to the introduction of this deferral and at my suggestion the IBTS advised the CJD advisory group of its plans to improve blood collection to address the shortfall in donations. The group was reassured as to its concerns about the balance of risk involved and the need to ensure an adequate blood supply in the interest of patient safety.</P>
      <P>The IBTS is assessing the introduction of a further deferral which will concern donors who have spent one year or more in the UK between 1980 and 1996. Over the summer period the blood supply was not particularly robust. It was necessary to issue several appeals during that time. While supplies to hospitals were maintained, there is not at present sufficient flexibility in the system to allow a further deferral to take place without a very serious risk of a shortage of blood and the consequences of such a shortage. Accordingly, the IBTS has advised my Department that it is of the opinion that it could not proceed at this point in time with a further deferral without the risk of serious shortages and the consequential risks for patient care and safety. For this reason the IBTS propose to continue with the current deferral of people who had resided in the UK for five years or more between 1980 and 1996 inclusive. The board will review the situation in February 2002 including the viability of a further deferral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim, the IBTS is conducting a <Col N="1529" /> detailed and aggressive review of donor clinic practices and donor selection criteria. The Blood for Life Week which I launched recently resulted in a substantial number of new and lapsed donors attending clinics. The IBTS has had endorsements from business and commerce, sportsmen and sportswomen, musicians and entertainers, public representatives and health service personnel. Up to the end of October 2001 a total of 20,529 new donors attended. This compares with 18,848 new donors for the full year in 2000. On the other hand stricter donor criteria has meant a further increase in the number of potential donors who are now deferred. The figure for deferral stood at 12% in 1996; 17% in 2000; and has increased to 21% in the current year. The IBTS has also undertaken a number of additional steps to reduce the potential risk of transmission of vCJD through blood transfusion:</P>
    <P>&ndash;Universal leucodepletion of cellular components was introduced in November 1999 as a precaution against the transmission of vCJD.</P>
    <P>&ndash;Sourcing plasma from a BSE free area. Contractual negotiations are being finalised with a pharmaceutical company which will source plasma from voluntary non-remunerated donors in the USA. The plasma will be processed in Europe and shipped to the IBTS for distribution to hospitals.</P>
    <P>&ndash;It has also been agreed to source cryoprecipritate from the USA.</P>
    <P>&ndash;The IBTS has also discontinued the shipment of plasma for fractionation abroad.</P>

      <P>As recommended by the Commission on Nursing, a working party, the review group on health service care staff, was set up to establish standard criteria in relation to the education and training of health care attendants, ward attendants and other relevant non-nursing personnel across the health service. The review group laid out guidelines on the criteria for the selection of pilot sites for the introduction of a national programme of training for health care assistants due to commence this autumn. The review group agreed that the employers were best positioned to select these pilot sites. Consequently, the health board chief executive officer group, following consultation with the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies regarding the learning disability sector, and with the voluntary hospital sector, submitted a list of pilot sites on the basis of ensuring that all specialties requested were encompassed. These were agreed by the review group.</P>
      <P>I understand that University College Hospital, Galway, was not selected as a pilot site by the chief executive officer group on the basis that its suggested specialty was included at another pilot site. The Deputy may wish to note that the pilot sites chosen for the Western Health Board region are Mayo and Roscommon. The course will be delivered in Mayo General and Portiuncula Hospitals. However, clinical placements will be drawn from a range of service areas. It is hoped the programme will be extended nationally following successful completion and assessment of the pilot programme.</P>

      <P>As part of the implementation of Building Healthier Hearts, the report of the cardiovascular health strategy group, on 20 September last year Ireland needs a Change of Heart was launched. This mass media campaign on heart health primarily targets the individual and aims to influence lifestyle choices which affect heart health, such as smoking, diet and physical activity. It also aims to raise public awareness of the existence of a national five year programme to reduce the incidence of heart disease in Ireland. The heart health handbook, A Handy Guide to a Healthier Heart, is a 16-page comprehensive handbook which has been produced to advise the public on the lifestyle changes each individual can make to improve their heart health. A copy of this handbook was sent to each household in the country in October 2000.</P>
      <P>The cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, sets out the priorities for cardiovascular disease prevention in accordance with recommendations of the Joint European Task Force on Cardiovascular Disease in Clinical Practice. Highest priority is given to secondary prevention, the prevention of recurrent episodes in those who have already developed symptoms of cardiovascular disease. Discussions are under way with key stakeholders to implement the strategy's recommendations on secondary prevention. A proposal from the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Heart Foundation has provided a basis for these discussions.</P>
      <P>Successful implementation of the programme for secondary prevention will provide a model on which primary prevention initiatives can be built. This will involve a structured approach to risk assessment, with health check-ups and follow-up of those identified as being at high risk. Some 1,054 pacemakers were inserted in 1999 and 1,203 pacemakers were inserted in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fainting and unexpected falls can arise as a result of a number of conditions, including disturbances of heart rhythm. Some such arrhythmias are appropriately treated by the insertion of a cardiac pacemaker. It is a matter of clinical judgment as to when such a pacemaker should be advised to treat a patient. Capacity to insert pacemakers has been increased with the establishment of a pacemaker service in Waterford Regional Hospital. A working group is examining the provision of consultant cardiology services, chaired by Comhairle na nOspidéal and involving the advisory forum on cardiovascular health. The working group will make recommendations on <Col N="1536" /> the location of additional regional cardiology services, including pacemaker insertion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318 and 319 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the primary childhood immunisation programme is to protect the child population against a range of potentially serious infectious diseases. MMR vaccine is available free of charge from family doctors under the primary childhood immunisation programme and there is no provision for children to receive separate measles, mumps or rubella vaccinations under this scheme. The MMR vaccine has been demonstrated to be both safe and effective. On the basis of currently available information, there is no evidence that giving each of the component vaccines separately has any greater benefit than the combined vaccines. Splitting the MMR vaccine into separate components would involve extra injections for children and would cause both children and the people with whom they come in contact to be exposed to these potentially serious diseases for a much longer period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information currently available to my Department is that separate measles or mumps vaccines are not available here. With regard to public concern about the MMR vaccine, the expert advice available from national and international bodies, including the WHO and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland is that the MMR vaccine is safe and effective. In addition, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in its report on childhood immunisation <Col N="1537" /> found no evidence of a proven link between MMR and autism and no evidence that the separate vaccines are any safer than the combined MMR vaccine.</P>
    <P>General practitioners are aware of the contra-indications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioners before making a decision about their child's immunisation. I am not aware of any general practitioners being forced to import measles vaccine as MMR vaccine is available free of charge to general practitioners from health board supplies.</P>

As the Deputy is aware, different methods of payment are used by the existing co-operatives at present.

      <P>In a letter dated 15 June 2001, my Department received a copy of legal advice acquired by the Northern Area Health Board on the grant-in-aid scheme. The advice was to the effect that the board's proposed scheme conflicted with the statutory provisions of the Health Act, 1970. The board subsequently declared in a press statement on 17 October last that it was not going ahead with its proposed scheme.</P>
      <P>However, under the orthodontic initiative, my Department recently approved a proposed scheme from the Mid-Western Health Board to engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. This scheme will facilitate similar arrangements in the NAHB. Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, four dentists for the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; ERHA &ndash; commenced their training in October for specialist in orthodontics qualifications and discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
      <P>My Department has also funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the postgraduate medical and dental board. The director of specialist training has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million &ndash; 6.729 million &ndash; has been approved for orthodontic services this year of which £3.7 million &ndash; 4.698 million &ndash; is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million &ndash; 2.971 million &ndash; this year for orthodontic services of which £1.61 million &ndash; 2.044 million &ndash; was for the orthodontic initiative. This will enable the authority to recruit additional staff and engage the service of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 325 and 332 together.</P>
      <P>In April 1998, my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, announced the phase 2 development of University College Hospital, Galway. This will see the development of the hospital as a major regional centre providing the range of specialties associated with a university teaching hospital. The tender for this contract was signed on 23 June 2000 and work has commenced. The phase 2 development provides for cardiac surgery, radiotherapy and trauma orthopaedic facilities, a burns unit, additional ICU beds, an MRI unit, a new medical social work department and a new concourse to include administration and admissions. The establishment of neurosurgery facilities at the hospital is not envisaged at this time. However, the appointment of a second consultant neurologist at the hospital was approved in January 2000.</P>

      <P>Under arrangements for public hospital services introduced in June 1991 on foot of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, everyone, regardless of income, is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges from which medical card holders are exempt. Alternatively, one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital.</P>
      <P>Currently, there is a statutory charge of £25 for attendance at accident and emergency departments where a person has not been referred by a medical practitioner. Medical card holders are exempt from this charge. On admission to hospital, following directly from attendance at an accident and emergency department, a patient must then decide whether he or she wishes to be treated as a public or private patient. In relation to each clinical consultation, private patients, following admission to hospital, are liable for the appropriate accommodation charges and consultants fees in addition to the statutory charges once they explicitly exercise their option to be treated as a private patient.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available to my Department. National information on in-patients in publicly <Col N="1541" /> funded acute hospitals is available from the hospital in-patient inquiry system. Data on mortality are compiled by the Central Statistics Office and published in the quarterly and annual reports on vital statistics. Both of these information systems contain detailed data pertaining to diagnosis. However, it is not possible in the case of deaths from infectious diseases to identify cases of cross-infection. The reason for this is that the source of infection is frequently unknown and in most cases difficult to establish without intensive research.</P>
      <P>My Department has tried to establish whether any studies that measure mortality from cross-infection in hospitals exist and is unaware of any current research addressing the issue. Inquiries have also been made with the National Disease Surveillance Centre and it too is unaware of any source of information relating to deaths due to cross-infection in Irish hospitals.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than <Col N="1542" /> for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his-her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, a commitment was given that the health board chief executive officers would examine the operation of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. This review has been completed recently and I understand that the chief executive officers will present a report of their findings to my Department shortly. This report will be considered as part of the existing examination of the issue of eligibility that is taking place in the context of the new health strategy.</P>

    <P>Additional funding amounting to £2.895 million, 3.68 million, with a full year cost of £3.260 million, 4.14 million, has been allocated this year to the Western Health Board for the development of services for persons with intellectual disabilities and those with autism.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review, structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, six dentists for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training this month for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the post-graduate medical and dental board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In <Col N="1544" /> addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October last. Capital funding of approximately £1 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard. My Department would welcome proposals for a specialist training programme from this university and the consultant orthodontists of the Southern Health Board and neighbouring boards.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million, 6.729 million, has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million, 4.698 million, is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as part of the initiative, my Department is also exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists. The Southern Health Board has been allocated an additional £0.938 million, 1.191 million this year for orthodontic services, of which £0.813 million, 1.032 million, was for the orthodontic initiative. Under the initiative, the board proposes to, <i>inter alia</i>, recruit an additional two consultant orthodontists, one of which will be located in Kerry. Responsibility for the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons in County Kerry rests with the Southern Health Board. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.</P>

      <P>I am aware that, nationwide, there are shortages of speech and language therapists and, in response, my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists, including speech and language therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of work force requirement for qualified personnel in these areas to 2015 was published on 25 July last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years, including a fourfold increase in speech and language therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy. Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establish<Col N="1547" /> ment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; and career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions published in April 2000.</P>
    <P>I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end, an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, HEA. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. I have contacted the chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board who is responsible for identifying the requirement for speech and language therapists in this area through the service planning process. The chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board will be in direct contact with the Deputy to advise him of relevant service developments.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, two dentists from the Western Health Board are currently in training for specialist dentist in orthodontics qualifications. Additional funding of £0.495 million, 0.628 million, has been allocated to the Western Health Board this year for orthodontic services of which £0.420 million, 0.533 million, was for an orthodontic initiative in the board. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that a specialist in orthodontics was recently recruited and the board envisages that he will start work in late November. The board has also made arrangements with private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as part of the orthodontic initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients by health board staff in out-of-hours sessions. I am confident that these structural changes to the orthodontic service, together with the orthodontic initiative, will significantly increase the number of patients in and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>The maintenance of orthodontic waiting lists in the Western Health Board region is the responsibility of the board. According to returns submitted to my Department, the numbers on orthodontic waiting lists maintained by the Western Health Board over the last four years are as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 344 and 349 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I have initiated a range of measures to substantially increase the capacity of the orthodontic services and reduce the waiting times for orthodontic treatment. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review, structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, six dentists for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training this month for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health <Col N="1550" /> Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
    <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the postgraduate medical and dental board. The Director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October last. Capital funding of approximately £1 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million, 6.729 million, has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million, 4.698 million, is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff. In addition, the Eastern Regional Health Authority has developed a six surgery facility and a five surgery unit at Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit and St. James' Hospital orthodontic unit, respectively.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under this initiative, my Department is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists. My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan, both of which are operational, and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed earlier this year.</P>
    <P>I am confident that when fully implemented this initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients in and reduce waiting times for treatment. The recruitment of orthodontic staff is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. The chief executive officers of the boards have informed me of the following information in relation to personnel in their orthodontic services: </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes <Col N="1552" /> include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
      <P>Agreement has now been reached at the Health Service Employers Agency on the creation of the specialist in orthodontics grade in the orthodontic service. In addition, six dentists for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board commenced their training this month for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, three dentists from the Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board are already in specialist training for orthodontics and this brings the total number of dentists in such training to nine. Discussions on providing an additional training course to commence in 2002 are also under way.</P>
      <P>My Department has funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish committee for specialist training in dentistry through the postgraduate medical and dental board. The director has taken up duty and will play a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. In addition, my Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. Applications for the post were invited when it was advertised on 19 October last. Capital funding of approximately £1 million was also provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</P>
      <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million, 6.729 million, has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million, 4.698 million, is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, under this initiative, my Depart<Col N="1553" /> ment is exploring with health boards new arrangements for the treatment of patients, both by private specialist orthodontic practitioners and in out-of-hours sessions by health board orthodontists. My Department has also funded the development of new regional orthodontic units at Dundalk and Navan &ndash; both of which are operational &ndash; and the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Midland Health Board who was appointed earlier this year. I am confident that when fully implemented this initiative, combined with the structural changes to the orthodontic service, will significantly increase the number of patients in and reduce waiting times for treatment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 346 and 347 together.</P>
      <P>Orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in operation. Their purpose is to allow prioritisation of children for orthodontic treatment based on the severity of need. The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way patients in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. Patients assessed as category A have severe malocclusions and should receive urgent orthodontic care; patients assessed as category B have less severe problems and are placed on orthodontic treatment waiting lists. The number of cases treated will depend on the level of resources available, in terms of qualified staff, in an area.</P>
      <P>Health board consultant orthodontists recommended that the 1985 guidelines be modified to prioritise treatment for the most severe categories of patients. My Department will be writing to the chief executive officers of the health boards concerning the operation of these modified guidelines with regard to maintaining the delivery of orthodontic services in a prioritised way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer's report on ortho<Col N="1554" /> dontics, known as the Moran report, recommended the use of an alternative index of need. This is known as the index of orthodontic treatment need &ndash; IOTN. The chief dental officer has advised that this new index should not be implemented until its implications have been evaluated in a national survey of children's dental health. This survey is currently under way and is expected to be completed in April 2002. The purpose of the survey is to identify accurately the number of children that would benefit from orthodontic treatment and the resources needed to meet the corresponding level of care.</P>

      <P>The performance of health boards in implementing orthodontic guidelines is being monitored by a health services research contract currently under way in health boards. The decision on whether impacted canine teeth should be extracted is a matter for a consultant orthodontist to decide, having full regard for all the clinical circumstances of each individual case.</P>
      <P>The number of cases in each health board area where impacted canines were extracted in each of the last five years is not routinely collected by my Department. As the responsibility for the collection of this data rests with the health boards, my Department has asked the chief executive officers to reply to the Deputy directly with this information.</P>

Light commercial vehicles are subject to biennial testing. The scheme of testing, which has been in operation since 1982, is reviewed regularly by my Department in the light of experience, in response to new EU requirements and to ensure that best practice is used in the conduct of tests. In this context, my Department intends to make modifications to the scheme to provide for a more efficient method to test emissions and an additional test element for speed limiter equipment. Other measures which will <Col N="1556" /> assist in securing adherence to vehicle standards include Directive 2000/30/EC and the ADR agreement which provide for random roadside roadworthiness testing of HGVs and annual roadworthiness testing of vehicles used for the carriage of dangerous goods.

      <P>Education and information is recognised in the Government road safety strategy 1998-2002 as vital to forming good road safety habits in younger people who are the adult road users of the future. The National Safety Council, which was assigned the lead role in this area by the Government strategy, has developed a resource pack on road safety for input into the social, personal, health and education programme in the new primary school curriculum. The resource pack was launched in September 2000 and over 30,000 copies have been distributed to primary school teachers, principals and boards of management.</P>
      <P>The National Safety Council has also developed a secondary school transition year resource project on road safety, which was pilot tested in 20 secondary schools and launched on 10 September 2001. The resource will complement existing activities in secondary schools. The council also regularly targets young drivers in its public media campaigns. My Department was represented on a task group set up by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) in autumn 2000 at the request of the Minister for Education and Science, to look at the area of driver education. The task group submitted its report to the Minister and I understand that he has authorised the NCCA to proceed with the research phase of a project on driver education recommended in the report.</P>

If any question arises in a particular case as to what does <Col N="1557" /> or does not constitute development or exempted development, the question may be referred to An Bord Pleanála for a decision. A number of classes of exempted development are set out in the second schedule to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, which provide for certain types of mobile structures to be exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is no specific exemption for a generator as described, it may fall under Classes 15 and 15A of the second schedule. These classes provide that where an authorised development is being carried out, any structures, works, plant or machinery needed temporarily in connection with <Col N="1558" /> that development can be erected, constructed or placed, without planning permission, on, in or under the land or on the adjoining land. The structures, works, plant and machinery can stay in place for the period in which the development is being carried out and must be removed at the end of the period and the land reinstated, unless it states otherwise in the permission. Where the development consists of mining, the structures, works, plant or machinery must be removed prior to the commencement of the mining.</P>

The average waiting time is derived having regard to waiting times, ranging from the shortest to the longest, experienced by individual applicants over a particular period at a test centre. The waiting times that are quoted by staff members would normally be the current longest time any individual has had to wait for a test. This would be on a precautionary basis so as to let applicants know of the longest time they could expect to wait for a test.

The relevant current regulations, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as required under section 10 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, are the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) Regulations, 1998, and the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) (Amendment) Regulations, 2000.</P>
      <P>On 17 October 2001 I published a consultation paper on a potential national ban on bituminous coal and petcoke so as to reduce ambient smoke levels across the country and national sulphur dioxide emissions. The consultation process allows the public, the solid fuel trade and all interested parties to consider the relevant issues and to respond to my Department. All responses will be evaluated before a decision is made by Government. I envisage any national ban being implemented by way of regulations laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An issue raised specifically in the consultation <Col N="1560" /> paper is the availability of alternative smokeless solid fuels. In the context of a final decision, full consideration will be given to ensuring the timely availability of adequate supplies of such alternative fuels, as necessary. As regards any increased costs of alternative solid fuels for people on low incomes, the consultation paper addresses the implications of the possible ban for extending the supplementary fuel allowance paid by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to all qualifying persons during the winter heating season.</P>

Since that date, planning authorities have been empowered to review existing development plans and prepare new development plans in accordance with the provisions of the 2000 Act. My Department has already issued guidance to planning authorities in relation to,<i> inter alia</i>, the development plan provisions of the 2000 Act. Guidelines for planning authorities on the form and content of development plans are currently being prepared by my Department and will be published soon in draft form for a period of public consultation.

      <P>The zero waste concept embraces a range of possible approaches and measures aimed at reducing consumption of <Col N="1561" /> materials, minimising waste generation and maximising re-use and recycling, with a view to diverting waste from landfill. Local and regional waste management plans, which I hope to see rapidly implemented, already incorporate such measures and objectives. I will shortly publish a comprehensive policy statement on waste prevention and recycling which will support the delivery of the plans and of the national hazardous waste management plan in these regards.</P>
      <P>I fully support practical measures to maximise the diversion of waste from landfill, in accordance with the requirements of the waste hierarchy. However, I do not consider it meaningful to adopt an aspiration target of 100% diversion of waste from landfill by some future date. In this regard, I note that the Green Party's ten point zero waste strategy, which borrows heavily from the existing regional waste management plans, does not set any timescale for achievement of its objectives and is predicated on the indefinite storage of residential waste in locally-based storage depots.</P>
      <P>While zero waste strategies have been adopted by a number of cities and municipalities in North America, Australia and New Zealand, their success or otherwise will not be evident for some years. As far as I am aware, to date no country has adopted a 100% landfill diversion target.</P>

      <P>Individual local authorities are responsible for the provision of cycle facilities in their functional areas as part of their traffic management role. My Department, in association with the Dublin Transportation Office, published a design manual for cycle facilities, Provision of Cycle Facilities &ndash; National Manual for Urban Areas, which was circulated to all local authorities in March 1998. The manual is intended to <Col N="1562" /> assist local authorities to provide cycle facilities to a uniform and high standard. Ensuring the safety of cyclists was an important consideration in developing the manual, which drew on international practice, particularly from the Netherlands and the UK. The manual sets out comprehensive guidelines for the design and provision of cycle facilities, specifically addresses the need for continuity in relation to cycle facilities and shows examples where this can be achieved with particular reference to the question of continuity through junctions and at pinch points. The DTO is now reviewing the cycle manual in the light of experience since 1998.</P>

      <P>The November 2000 regulations provided a revised basis for taxi licensing following a High Court decision which created the legal position that the limitation of taxi licences in the interests of existing licence holders could not be sustained. The regulations responded to the reality of the new legal situation and sought to establish orderly licensing arrangements within it. The Government is committed to the implementation of this new regime which, I believe, is already bringing significant benefits to the public through the increased availability of taxis.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation, as the largest taxi licensing authority in the country, has engaged consultants to carry out a customer service assessment to compare current service levels with those obtaining during the last such assessment in 1998 and to identify potential areas for further service improvement. I anticipate that this study will provide more broadly based and up to date information on the level of taxi services in Dublin and on the impact of the liberalisation of taxi services under the new regime.</P>

It will apply to all plastic bags suitable for use by customers at the point of sale in supermarkets, service stations or other sales outlets, except plastic bags solely used to contain fresh meat, fish and poultry and plastic bags solely used to contain the products referred to, whether packaged or not, provided that such bags are not greater in dimension than 215mm by 345mm by 450mm, and plastic bags solely used to contain non-packaged fruit, nuts or vegetables, confectionery, dairy products, and cooked food, whether cold or hot, provided that such bags are not greater than the dimensions referred to above.</P>
      <P>The exemptions above only apply where bags are used for the purposes referred to. If other products are placed in these bags, then the retailer must charge the levy to the consumer.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of options currently available to assist lower income households and elderly persons, in particular, to secure necessary improvement works to their houses including the provision of heating systems. These include the task force on special housing aid for the elderly, the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes, the local authority house improvement <Col N="1564" /> loan scheme and the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme.</P>
      <P>The task force on special housing aid for the elderly provides funding to the health boards to undertake necessary basic repairs and improvements to the houses of elderly persons. In the interests of elderly persons, the scheme has, since its inception, been administered with a minimum of formality and it has been an objective to avoid formal procedural and other requirements. Works are, in appropriate circumstances, carried out at no cost to the applicant. The terms of the scheme were extended last year to include, where appropriate, the provision of heating systems. I allocated record funding of £8.658 million to the task force in 2001.</P>
      <P>I have also introduced significant improvements to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes. The effective maximum grant available under the disabled persons grant scheme was increased from £8,000 to £16,000 with the grant covering up to 90% of the approved cost of the works compared to two thirds previously. In addition, I have increased the maximum grant available under the essential repairs grant from £1,800 to £7,500. These improvements have allowed local authorities and health boards to extend the type of work that can be undertaken in individual cases, including the provision of heating systems.</P>
      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of existing local authority dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own resources. However, where capital funding is provided under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major essential works to designated estates, the installation of central heating in dwellings may form part of the works undertaken. In addition to the funding available under the remedial works scheme, local authorities may seek my Department's approval for the use of internal capital receipts which are surplus to the requirements of their local authority housing programme and remedial works scheme, for improvement works such as the provision of central heating to their dwellings. A number of local authorities have used, and continue to use, this approach to install central heating in their rented dwellings.</P>

      <P>Development contributions are an important source of funding for necessary infrastructure, such as roads and sewers which are supportive of development and which would otherwise have to be provided at public expense by the local authority. Under section 48 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, planning authorities must draw up a scheme of development contributions to cover the estimated cost of infrastructure provided in their areas. However, in setting out the contributions to be paid, local authorities will be able to provide for the payment of reduced or no contributions where they consider this appropriate.</P>

      <P>The new house grant offers assistance to people who are first-time purchasers of new houses. Information regarding the number of new house grants approved and paid is contained in my Department's Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin 2000, copies of which are available from the Oireachtas Library. The new house grant scheme was last increased on 25 February 1993 from £2,000 (2,539) to £3,000 (3,809) when the VAT rate on construction work was being increased from 10% to 12.5%. Expenditure on the new house grants payments in 2000 was just over £30 (38) million and a provision of £30 (38) million has been made for 2001. The cost of administering the scheme in 2000 was approximately £1.9 (2.41) million. Increasing the new house grant to £5,000 (6,348), would cost the Exchequer an estimated £19 (24) million per annum, and would have no additional benefit to the first-time buyer as an increase would likely add to inflationary pressures in the new house market. I have no proposals to extend the scheme to include first-time purchasers of second hand houses.</P>

      <P>Public involvement and support are essential to tackle the problem of litter pollution successfully. Individual members of the public can assist in achieving this objective, first, by not causing litter themselves and, second, by supporting local authority and other action against litter. Public participation already features strongly in a range of relevant initiatives assisted by my Department (including local authority litter education and awareness campaigns, the An Taisce-led National Spring Clean, and the Tidy Towns competition) and will continue to do so. While primary responsibility for enforcement action must lie with local authorities, members of the public can also support them in this work, including by reporting possible offences under litter or other legislation and by giving evidence in legal proceedings as necessary; a number of local authorities have recently introduced free-phone services to facilitate such reporting. In the circumstances, I have no proposals for legislative change along the lines referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>School meals are funded by my Department using two different avenues at present. One is the school meals scheme, which has been operated in conjunction with certain local authorities for over eighty years. The other is the school meals community programme which I introduced last year. The school meals scheme provides financial assistance to local authorities, except county councils, for the provision of school meals for national school children who are &ldquo;unable by reason of lack of food to take full advantage of the education provided for them&rdquo;. In most cases, the local authorities provide participating schools with a sandwich or a bun and milk for each eligible child. My Department meets half of the food costs. The school meals community programme meets the food costs of the voluntary and community based groups that are currently operating innovative school meals projects outside of the scope of the statutory school meals scheme. This funding is provided to initiatives known as breakfast, lunch, homework or after school clubs at local level, that are targeting areas of disadvantage or children with special needs.</P>
      <P>The type of meals provided is decided by the local groups that design and run the projects. The amount of funding given by my Department depends on the type and number of meals provided. As the Deputy may be aware, I have established an interdepartmental working group to review the school meals scheme with a view to developing proposals for the future of school meals provision. The membership of the working group includes, amongst others, a consultant dietitian representing the Department of Health and Children. As part of their considerations the group will be examining the nutritional value of the food that will be provided under the reformed scheme. I expect to receive the working group's report towards the end of this year, following which I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government regarding a reformed school meals scheme.</P>

      <P>In assessing means for widow(er)'s (non-contributory) pension, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, for example, earnings from employment or self-employment, together with the value of any capital or property. In the case of income from employment as a home-help, the first £30 (38.09) of weekly earnings is disregarded. The original rationale for the disregard was to allow people to take up casual employment in the home help service without affecting their social welfare payment, at a time when the service did not come within the realm of conventional employment. Following the conclusion of Labour Court negotiations in June 2001, agreement was reached on a revised overall pay structure for home helps in return for a restructured and enhanced home help service. The agreement provided for the alignment of hourly home help pay rates with the pay rates of other non-nursing health service employees, the payment of travel expenses, premia payments for Saturday/Sunday working and full annual leave entitlement as set out in the part-time workers agreement in the health service.</P>
      <P>The revised pay rates were awarded on a phased basis of 75% from 1 January 2000, 85% from 1 July 2000 and the full rate from 1 January 2001. Accordingly, home helps now have full employee status similar to all other health service employees. The Department of Finance has emphasised that during all stages of the negotiations, including the Labour Court, it was made absolutely clear that any concessions, currently enjoyed by home helps in the area of income tax and or social welfare would cease should the unions succeed in their pay claim. In this context, the current arrangements for home helps are being reviewed.</P>

      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question is a staff member in the Department who, on 15 August 1984, opted to join the revised spouses and children's contributory pension scheme for established civil servants which was promulgated at the time by way of Department of Finance Circular 16/84. The person concerned was absent on a career break at the time she signed on for the scheme and the normal deduction of 1.5% of salary should have commenced upon her return to duty on 10 April 1989. It recently came to light that, inadvertently, deductions from the staff member's salary <Col N="1574" /> towards the scheme have not been made. Accordingly, an amount of £1,636.01 (2,077.30), i.e., 1.5% of various salary rates from 10 April 1989 to 8 November 2001, which should have been collected from the staff member's salary, remains outstanding. This actual amount £1,636.01 (2,077.30) may be paid by deduction from salary until recouped, or by deduction of the full amount from the staff member's lump sum entitlement at the time of retirement from the Civil Service. The staff member has been informed that it is possible to pay additional contributions by periodic deductions from salary in order to reduce the amount deductible from final superannuation awards. The scheme is contributory and all participating in it are required to pay appropriate contributions. Benefits for spouses and children are dependent on the members having paid such contributions. The scheme does not provide for the waiving of contributions.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since its commencement, £22 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2000 has assisted some 80,482 individuals.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the purchase and/or installation cost of small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems such as the &ldquo;pendant&rdquo; alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
      <P>Funding is not available under the scheme for conventional intruder/burglar alarms of the type indicated in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>To qualify for assistance under the scheme, older people, aged 65 or over, must be living alone or be living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older people who are dependent and vulnerable and be unable to install or purchase the equipment covered by the scheme themselves.</P>
      <P>While the grant available may vary in the light of individual circumstances, grants in general will cover 50% of total costs but grants up to 90% may be made where the circumstances so warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Individuals who wish to obtain information on how they, or older people known to them, can obtain assistance under this scheme should con<Col N="1577" /> tact their local representative of any of the organisations involved in the scheme, such as, Muintir na Tíre, Neighbourhood Watch, Community Alert, or any other group involved in the scheme in their local area. I propose to advertise the scheme of community support for older people extensively in both the national and provincial press by the end of March 2002, at which time any voluntary or community-based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people may submit applications for funding on their behalf.</P>

      <P>In the context of determining entitlement to disability benefit and other illness-related schemes, medical assessors of my Department provide a second opinion to that of the claimant's own doctor for the guidance of the Department's deciding officers who ultimately make the decision in these cases. All of the medical assessors are fully qualified and experienced medical practitioners with registration in accordance with Medical Council criteria.</P>
      <P>Among the medical assessor cadre are individual doctors with postgraduate and higher qualifications in various fields of occupational medicine including psychology and psychotherapy. Continuing medical education is provided by national and international experts in human disability evaluation.</P>
      <P>Concerning mental health evaluation, the ability of claimants to undertake their usual or other types of work is evaluated having regard to the nature of the work, their capacity to complete tasks, to cope with daily living-pressure and to interact with other people.</P>
      <P>At the medical examination, the medical assessor will have available to him or her the initial medical diagnosis, supplemented, where applicable, by relevant specialist and other reports. In addition, the claimant's certifying doctor is informed and may attend if he or she so desires. In certain complex cases the chief medical adviser may also seek relevant specialist opinion.</P>
      <P>The primary task of the medical assessor is to evaluate the overall medical condition of the claimant having regard to the prescribed medical criteria for entitlement to the particular illness-related scheme. In the course of this evaluation all relevant and available medical information is taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is made to protect the interests of the person and examinations are conducted in an <Col N="1578" /> impartial and independent manner in accordance with accepted medical practice.</P>
    <P>A wide range of mental and physical incapacities feature in the area of occupational medicine and human disability. Many cases have both a physical and mental dimension. It is felt that current arrangements are the most effective and customer friendly with an emphasis on continuing medical education and relevant training and access to specialist advice as appropriate.</P>

      <P>The social welfare benchmarking and indexation group, established under the terms of the programme for prosperity and fairness, reported in September 2001. While it did not prove possible to reach consensus on the desirability of establishing a formal benchmark for social welfare rates, the group did produce the following majority recommendation: </P>
      <P>Recognising that the exact rate was a matter for Government, and having balanced the various factors set out in the terms of reference, the majority of the group considered that the target of 27% of GAIE [gross average industrial earnings] (on a current-year basis) for the lowest social welfare payments was not an unreasonable policy objective. Given current uncertainties in relation to the short-term economic position, it was difficult to be prescriptive about the precise time frame, although it would not be unreasonable to expect that the target would be met in full by 2007, that is, in the budget announced late in 2006.</P>
      <P>The report also contained a rough estimate of the total costs of this proposal over the period to 2007. Assuming a steady incremental progress towards the target rate in the period 2002-07 and assuming that existing relativities between welfare rates were maintained in full would indicate that additional expenditure of the order of £2.9 billion, approximately 3.7 billion, would be required in respect of weekly welfare rates and FIS payments if the target of 27% GAIE was reached at that stage, that is, excluding child related payments. It should be noted that annual increases in any event will be provided for in the rates of weekly welfare payments. Accordingly, the net additional cost associated with the proposal would therefore be lower.</P>
      <P>With regard to child related payments, the group recommended that the appropriate equivalence level of basic child income support should be set at 33% to 35% of the minimum adult social welfare payment rate. Assuming the 27% GAIE target was met in full, aggregate additional expenditure of some £363 million, 461 million, to £526 million, 668 million, on child benefit payments would be needed over the period to 2007, over and above the existing £1 billion, 1.27 billion, Government commitments for the period to 2003, to achieve that level. This assumes that the current policy of channelling all additional child income supports through the child benefit scheme remains in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group also costed the benchmark options assuming, for simplicity, that the rate was achieved with immediate effect, that is, after the implementation of the changes announced in budget 2001. In this respect, the 27% GAIE <Col N="1580" /> option would cost approximately £1.235 billion, 1.568 billion, in a full year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 403 and 404 together.</P>
      <P>One of the principal conditions for receipt of carer's allowance is that full-time care and attention is required and being provided to the care recipient. The person concerned is currently in receipt of carer's allowance at the weekly rate of £88.50, 112.37. She applied for a further increase in her carer's allowance in respect of an additional care recipient on 6 July 2001.</P>
      <P>Her application was refused as the medical evidence submitted was insufficient to determine if full-time care and attention was required. The person concerned was notified of this decision and of her right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office. She subsequently appealed the decision and submitted further medical evidence in support of her appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having examined all the evidence provided, <Col N="1581" /> the Department's chief medical adviser expressed the opinion that the full-time care and attention condition was not satisfied in this case, and the original decision to refuse carer's allowance was upheld.</P>
    <P>The case has now been forwarded to the social welfare appeals office for further determination and the appeals office will be in contact with the person concerned shortly.</P>
    <P>The person concerned also applied for an increase in respect of a child dependant. In this regard she has been awarded a child dependant allowance of £6.60, 8.38, with effect from 18 October 2001 and payment has issued to her nominated post office for collection.</P>
    <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

      <P>The review of the carer's allowance, published in October 1998, examined the purpose of the carer's allowance and concluded that it is an income support payment and not a payment for caring. Accordingly, a payment along the lines suggested would not be appropriate in the context of the existing carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>However, the review did propose the introduction of a non-means tested continual care payment to recognise carers providing the highest levels of care and to promote care in the community. It envisaged that such a payment would be made, irrespective of income or social welfare entitlement, to carers caring for those who are in the highest category of dependency.</P>
      <P>In order to differentiate between the levels of care and care needs, the review considered that a needs assessment encompassing both the needs of the care recipient and the carer should be introduced, and that the continual care payment could be introduced following the introduction of such an assessment.</P>

    <P>Establishing a pilot system of needs assessment for carers and people needing care was identified as a priority in the Government's review of its action programme. This area is the responsibility <Col N="1583" /> of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>There are ongoing discussions at Government, regarding long-term care issues. These are taking place in the context of the health strategy, which I understand from my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 409 and 410 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that access to St Colmcille's Church was restricted during the recent foot and mouth crisis, as it was at all heritage sites. Regrettably due to an oversight on the part of my Department, at the time the all-clear was given to reopen heritage sites the restrictions put in place at this site were not lifted. I am assured the site is now once again fully accessible to the public.</P>
      <P>In relation to the maintenance of the site, my Department is responsible only for St. Colmcille's Church and not the graveyard. In this context the church is included in my Department's routine maintenance programme for County Donegal. In 2001 work, including weed control and grass cutting, was carried out at the site. There are no plans to provide car parking facilities.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the Government was brought before the European Court of Justice in relation to the special areas of conservation; the effect of the judgment of 11 September 2001; and the course of action proposed to comply with the EU Habitats Directive agreed nine years ago.</Quest>

      <P>The European Commission took cases against Ireland, France and Germany because the full national list of candidate special areas of conservation, SACs, had not been submitted. The court found against all three countries in these separate cases at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to place the court finding in context. The judgment of the European Court of Justice essentially reflects the legal position prevailing in February 1998 concerning the transmission of candidate special areas of conservation to the European Commission. The court, in delivering its judgment, was precluded from considering progress made by Ireland in the intervening three <Col N="1586" /> years with regard to transmission of candidate SACs.</P>
    <P>In February 1998, I informed the Commission that the delay in formally transmitting a list of candidate SACs was necessitated by the wider consultation process which I instigated in Ireland. My position was, and still is, that the only long-term practical way of ensuring the conservation of these important wildlife areas is to do so with the co-operation of landowners and land users. To this end I have insisted that consultation take place with those whose lands or land rights are affected, prior to formal transmission of the sites.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission agrees with my view that the success of the Natura 2000 Network is dependent on the co-operation of landowners and land users whose lands are included in the sites. All those whose lands are proposed for SAC designation should be given an opportunity to pursue any objections they may have to proposed designations. To this end, I arranged for appeals to be examined informally by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department. I also established an SAC Appeals Advisory Board, chaired by Mr. Michael Mills, the former ombudsman, with equal representation from the landowners and the conservation organisations, to assess appeals independently and to advise me on these matters.</P>
    <P>The effect of the judgment of 11 September is very limited because Ireland has made considerable progress since 1998 in relation to the transmission of candidate special areas of conservation to the Commission. On taking office in 1997, I found that no sites had been transmitted to the Commission. Since then, I have overseen the formal transmission of 363 sites, which cover some 9,907 square kilometres. Having regard to the number and extent of SACs that I have now proposed I anticipate that Ireland's proposals will be found sufficient for most habitats and species at the second Atlantic Region Biogeographical Seminar which is to be held early next year.</P>
    <P>I have decided in principle to propose new or extended SACs for the protection of salmon but these cannot be formally proposed until surveys to define their boundaries have been completed. This work is now well under way. Although it is difficult to estimate an exact time frame for completion of the survey work necessary to progress designation of salmon sites, I would expect the final batch of candidate SAC sites should be advertised and transmitted to the European Commission in 2002.</P>
    <P>Ireland has fully implemented the Habitats Directive in law. The 1997 regulations which transposed the directive into Irish law provided for the sites to be protected from the time they are first proposed and these provisions have been reinforced by section 75 of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 2000.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>the suc cess or otherwise of the grant scheme for the conservation of corncrakes; and her views on whether the grant support is adequate to ensure an increase in number.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The corncrake grant scheme, operated by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy is jointly funded by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, RSPB, and my Department through Dúchas &ndash; the Heritage Service. Since 1992, this scheme has received State funding through Dúchas amounting to approximately £466,000 including a grant of £49,000 in the current year, 2001.</P>
      <P>The grant scheme for the conservation of corncrakes was introduced for farmers who managed their land in a corncrake friendly manner in Donegal, the Shannon Callows and north west Mayo, the core areas where corncrakes are found in Ireland. The scheme has been reasonably successful in sharply slowing the decline in the corncrake population following a period of steep decline. In the period between 1988 and 1993 the population declined dramatically from 903 to 173 calling males. Since the introduction of this scheme numbers have fallen further, but have remained relatively stable since 1997. The figure for this year is 154 calling males. These figures are disappointing and do not adequately reflect the resources and commitment to the scheme of the project partners, Dúchas, RSPB and Birdwatch Ireland but I am satisfied that the scheme is worthwhile and should be continued.</P>
      <P>While the corncrake grant scheme has proved to be a valuable interim conservation scheme for the corncrake, the long-term strategy for corncrake conservation will be based largely on EU funded agri-environmental measures through the rural environmental protection scheme operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Under this scheme, participating landowners can attract significant grants for farming in an environmentally friendly way. As more landowners join REPs, they no longer become eligible for payments under the corncrake grant scheme. Discussions are ongoing with conservationists, farmers representatives, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and farm planners under the REPs to agree an appropriate prescription for corncrake friendly farming. The measures principally relate to dates of closing of meadows, dates of cutting hay and silage and mowing from the centre out.</P>
      <P>Dúchas is also funding &ndash; £25,000 in 2001 &ndash; a three year Ph.D. studentship based in University College Cork working on habitat management research for corncrakes in the Shannon Callows as well as a research grant of £15,000 to fund additional pilot habitat management measures in the Shannon Callows. It is hoped that this research will better inform and improve the farming prescription and allow numbers to increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> While the grant scheme has helped to reduce the decline in corncrake numbers it has not to date managed to effect a general increase in numbers. The population is still well short of recovery and remains extremely vulnerable. However, I am satisfied that the strategies being adopted to ensure the conservation of this important bird represents the deep commitment of all parties to the conservation of this remarkable bird.</P>

      <P>The register covers plant and machinery, including vehicles; office equipment and furniture and fittings. In the case of Dúchas this information is prepared at local level and, as such, details of what equipment is held at each depot is available locally.

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to artefacts etc., it has to be said <Col N="1589" /> that the majority of the sites in the care of my Department do not have original items which are of extraordinary value.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware from my previous reply on 5 July last, the door was removed because it did not open fully. There is no difficulty with the supplier regarding this matter. My officials are responsible for the specification for the door. The door, fittings and installation cost £2,680.88, which has been paid. A replacement centre panel for the door is being fabricated at an additional cost of approximately £800, which will include fitting. The original centre panel is in storage in the Kilkenny National Monuments Depot and may be re-used at another location.</P>
      <P>The &lsquo;rogue stone' is exactly that, a rogue. Building conservation cannot be an exact science and often unexpected problems arise when dealing with old structures. I refer the Deputy to the level of detail I have already provided in explaining this matter. I am satisfied all reasonable care was taken in the design of this door. This is a relatively isolated occurrence in the context of my Department's overall monuments conservation funding programme which I have significantly added to under the national development plan and which is carried out to international standards.</P>

While the machine has an additional feature that allows the cutting of stone profiles through computer aided design, CAD, this feature is not needed for the current stone-cutting works projects and, therefore, the training of staff to use the required software is not a priority, given the many other pressing demands in the works area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 423 and 454 to 457, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Legislation in the area of road haulage and general traffic matters is a matter for the Department of Public Enterprise and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Enforcement is a matter for the Garda and transport officers employed by the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>The Department of Public Enterprise is responsible for the enforcement of road haulage licensing and tachograph legislation as it applies to heavy goods vehicles. In relation to the issue of the adequacy and effectiveness of the existing arrangements for the inspection of road haulage vehicles, a number of measures are included in the programme of action for the road haulage industry. This programme was published by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, in February of this year.</P>
      <P>Under the programme, I understand that arrangements are being made to increase the number of enforcement officers and support staff in the road haulage division of the Department of Public Enterprise by 50%. I also understand that the level of enforcement checks by the Department of Public Enterprise officers has been stepped up significantly and a targeted blitz of certain areas and industries is under way.</P>
      <P>In relation to Garda action in relation to illegal haulage work, I am informed by the Garda authorities that gardaí are active in enforcing the relevant legislation. Operation Overload is a special Garda enforcement operation conducted as part of the Garda national road safety initiative, 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heavy goods vehicles and works vehicles using the public roads are the primary focus of Operation Overload. Enforcement during the period of these operations relate to vehicle and load dimensions, weights and condition of the vehicle, the use of off road dumpers and other works vehicles, tachograph regulations as well as the licensing of vehicles for haulage purposes. These national operations are supported by local road safety strategies which also target specific road haulage issues. I should also state that the Garda co-operates in joint campaigns with other agencies such as the Revenue Commissioners, and Department of Public Enterprise transport <Col N="1593" /> officers in enforcement of the laws relating to heavy goods vehicles.</P>
    <P>Garda anti-speeding campaigns also include speeding by heavy goods vehicles. However, Garda statistics for speeding offences do not differentiate between classes of vehicle. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that statistics in relation to prosecutions brought and the number of convictions obtained for breaches of the law in relation to speed limits and vehicle gross weights are not maintained in such a way to readily break them down into those which involve the construction, forestry or other haulage industries.</P>
    <P>Details in relation to Garda prosecutions for some breaches of the law in relation to road haulage are set out in the Annual Report of the Garda Síochána, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. The latest report is in respect of 1999.</P>
    <P>In relation to Garda enforcement personnel, the Deputy will be aware that the deployment of Garda resources is a matter for the Commissioner. Garda divisional traffic units and local personnel are involved in the enforcement of road traffic and transportation legislation on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>Garda enforcement activities are intelligence led and focus primarily on areas of high incidence of danger and offending, with appropriate Garda resources allocated to the task. Traffic law enforcement, including the laws in relation to heavy goods vehicles, will continue to be given a high priority for the remainder of this year and on into 2002.</P>
    <P>I believe that these and other enforcement measures being taken as part of the programme of action will significantly improve the level of compliance with road haulage and tachograph legislation.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the level of illegal drugs consumed by prisoners while in custody; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[26563/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to quantify the level of illegal drugs consumed by prisoners while in custody, particularly given the secretive nature of illicit drug taking. An exploratory study on drug use among prisoners, which was part funded by my Department, was published recently by the Health Research Board. This study, which focused on the Mountjoy Prison complex, found that once imprisoned, those who continued to engage in illicit drug use greatly reduced the quantity of drugs they used, and the frequency with which they used them, when compared to their drug use in the community. The study also found that initiation into drug use in the prison setting was rare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Prisons Service is resolutely committed to <Col N="1594" /> tackling drug abuse in a comprehensive way and has my full support in this. This involves a twin track approach of supply and demand reduction.</P>
    <P>A number of technical and policy measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling into and use of illegal drugs in the prison system. These include sophisticated video surveillance, improved visiting and searching facilities, including facilities for strip searching prisoners, increased vigilance by staff and urine testing. Where visitors are found attempting to supply drugs to inmates, the Garda is called to the prison with a view to prosecuting the persons concerned. A number of prosecutions in this area take place every year and persons have served prison sentences in this respect.</P>
    <P>Efforts to eliminate the supply of drugs coming into our prisons are not enough on their own. The Prisons Service will continue to seek to reduce demand for drugs within the prison system by the education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders.</P>
    <P>I would like to instance a number of the initiatives I have instigated to combat the drug addiction problem among the prison population. For example all committals to Mountjoy, Cloverhill Remand Prison and St. Patrick's who misuse drugs are offered a detoxification programme of up to 21 days duration; all committals to Cloverhill Remand Prison who are involved in a drug maintenance programme in the community prior to committal are allowed continue their programmes while in custody there &ndash; this maintenance programme option was extended to Mountjoy Prison in October 2000 with all new committals and prisoners transferring from Cloverhill Remand Prison who were on approved treatment programmes continuing to receive this while in the prison; on-going addiction counselling and education programmes are in place in all the closed prisons in this jurisdiction; community based agencies visit prisons to provide support services and information, including individual counselling as required; an information forum is provided by the Education and Welfare Services to prisoners throughout the prisons estate informing them of the risks posed by communicable diseases; a detoxification and drug free unit is in operation in Mountjoy and an intensive drug free therapy programme co-ordinated by the probation and welfare service and delivered by a multi-disciplinary team is in place; a second drug treatment programme began at the health care unit in Mountjoy in March 2000 &ndash; this offers a detoxification and intensive therapeutic counselling over 12 weeks to prisoners nearing release with a view to returning them drug free onto a structured drug treatment programme in the community; a new drug free wing in St. Patrick's Institution with a capacity for 76 inmates was officially opened by me on 22 November 2000.</P>
    <P>An initial group of 24 staff underwent developmental training to assist them in working with the new regime. This development has proven to be <Col N="1595" /> hugely successful with the wing currently operating to full capacity.</P>
    <P>An action plan on drug misuse and drug treatment in the prison system was approved by me in 1999. It advocated a broad general approach to raise the level of treatment for drug addicted offenders. This included the expansion of detoxification facilities, more drug free areas and the provision of methadone maintenance. The provision of addiction counselling support services was central to this recommended approach which built on a medical policy which had been agreed between my Department and the then Eastern Health Board in this area. It sought to provide the same access to treatment for prisoners as patients have within the community.</P>
    <P>At my request the director general of the Prisons Service then established a national steering group for prison based drug treatment services with a view to implementing the action plan. The steering group comprises representatives from this Department, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, senior Prisons Service management, probation and welfare service, prisons psychology service and the prison education service. The group submitted its first report to me in July 2000, and the report was circulated to various organisations for views and feedback. This report recommended the following three pronged strategy: the appointment of a drug treatment co-ordinator for the Dublin prisons; recruitment of drug treatment specialists in the counselling, psychological and medical fields; a training programme led by an assistant governor to enhance and further professionalise prison officers involved in interpersonal work with drug treatment prisoners.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the recommendations contained in the report was approved, in principle, by the Government on 18 October 2000 on the basis that the precise staffing and other expenditure related proposals would be the subject of direct negotiations between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Finance as well as the Prisons Service and health boards. A series of meetings have been held since November 2000 between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Department of Health and Children and the Prisons Service and health boards.</P>
    <P>As a result of these discussions, the recruitment process for the two key central positions identified in the steering group's report, that of the co-ordinator of drug treatment services  &ndash; prisons &ndash; and the assistant governor in charge of training, is now at an advanced stage. I understand that these posts will be filled shortly. Following consultation with the Department of Finance, the Prisons Service and the health boards are now in a position to commence the recruitment process for the other drug treatment posts recommended in the steering group's first report.</P>
    <P>Finally, building on all these plans and initiatives, I have given a policy direction to the Prison Service to have an officially designated drug free <Col N="1596" /> wing in place in every institution under its control by summer 2004.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the review referred to by the Deputy was an internal Garda review of its traffic operations for Garda management and, as such, its results would not be communicated to my Department. This review was part of the ongoing intelligence work of the Garda Síochána in the traffic enforcement area, as part of which they would monitor fatal and serious injury collisions at district, divisional and regional levels.</P>
      <P>It is a function of Garda management to ensure that intelligence in this area of law enforcement, as with other areas, is gathered, collated and acted upon appropriately and I am satisfied that the necessary practice and procedures are in place for this purpose. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on internal Garda operational matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 426 to 428, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The solicitors profession is regulated on a statutory basis. The OECD report on regulatory reform in Ireland, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 24 April last, contained recommendations on the profession. These will be examined as part of the response to the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Solicitors Acts, 1954 to 1994, provide for a disciplinary tribunal to deal with complaints of misconduct against solicitors. The tribunal con<Col N="1597" /> sists of ten solicitor members and five lay members. The lay members are appointed on my nomination. A member of the public or the Law Society may apply to the tribunal for an inquiry into the conduct of a solicitor. Where a finding of misconduct is made against a solicitor, the tribunal can impose penalties of a limited nature and, if they consider that the penalties which they are empowered to impose are not adequate in the light of the misconduct found, they can recommend more serious sanctions to the High Court including that the solicitor be struck off the roll.</P>
    <P>In addition to the functions of the tribunal in relation to misconduct, the Solicitors Acts give power to the Law Society to impose sanctions on solicitors for inadequate services or for charging excessive fees.</P>
    <P>A member of the public who is dissatisfied with how the Law Society handles a complaint made to them in relation to alleged misconduct, inadequate services or charging excessive fees may refer the matter to the adjudicator appointed under the Solicitors (Adjudicator) Regulations, 1997. The adjudicator can require the production of documents and make conclusions of fact and recommendations. He may direct the society to re-examine or re-investigate the related complaint made to it about a solicitor where he is not satisfied that the society has investigated the complaint adequately. He may also direct the society to make an application to the disciplinary tribunal for an inquiry into the conduct of the solicitor. The regulations provide that the adjudicator shall be independent in the discharge of his functions.</P>
    <P>I am aware that individual members of the public do feel aggrieved from time to time about how complaints are handled but this is the case with any dispute resolution mechanism. I am not convinced that, because of this alone, we should reduce the present regulatory functions of the Law Society over the profession.</P>
    <P>While all legislative provisions are subject to review, the broad structure of the disciplinary regime for solicitors appears to be satisfactory. However, in order to make it more effective, I intend to move amendments, some of which were circulated on 26 September 2001 to the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1998, which is awaiting Committee Stage in the Dáil having been passed by the Seanad. These amendments make important changes on disciplinary matters including the doubling of the size of the disciplinary tribunal and a substantial increase in penalties. I am satisfied that the Bill, when enacted, will further enhance the system for the handling of complaints against solicitors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 429 and 430 together.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers are not provided with free or subsidised mobile phones or motor vehicles and there are no plans to introduce concessions of this nature for this cohort. Neither do they have any entitlement to preferential treatment by virtue of their immigrant status in respect of any State welfare benefit schemes operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and-or health boards.</P>
      <P>As a rule, asylum seekers do not have access to local authority housing while their applications for refugee status are being determined. Persons granted refugee status are allowed access to the full range of housing and welfare entitlements applicable to Irish citizens. While it is a matter for individual local authorities to operate schemes in respect of the allocation of housing in their administrative areas, I am not aware of any preferential treatment being accorded to applicants for housing by virtue of their being recognised as a refugee.</P>
      <P>For the sake of completeness, I should state that since April, 2000 the basic needs of food and shelter of asylum seekers are met through the system of direct provision rather than through full cash and welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers accommodated in this manner are paid a weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance which has been reduced to take account of the value of the full board accommodation being provided by the State. This allowance currently stands at £15 per week per adult and £7.50 per week per child.</P>
      <P>In general, asylum seekers who entered the State prior to the introduction of direct provision and those removed from direct provision by health boards for medical or social reasons are living in private rented accommodation. Such asylum seekers are in receipt of full supplementary welfare allowance and rent supplement from health boards.</P>

As an outcome of these enquiries, the arresting member was satisfied as to the arrested person's identity and she was charged and subsequently released on bail to appear at Dublin District Court 44 at 10.30 a.m. on 27 September 2001.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the subject failed to appear in court on that date and that a bench warrant has been issued for her arrest. I am further informed that the case has not been finalised and that no fine was imposed.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the arresting garda has had no further dealings with this person and has received no information to indicate that she was not the person who is the subject of this question. In the circumstances, if the Deputy is aware of any information to the contrary, I would suggest that she bring it to the attention of the Garda authorities.</P>

The content of such a proposal is under examination by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office and the Land Registry, since it raises certain constitutional, technical and practical difficulties.

Under this system the agency provides full board accommodation to asylum seekers in a number of settings including hostels, guesthouses and former hotels while their claims for refugee status are being determined. The agency is not involved in the letting of houses to asylum seekers or refugees. Under the terms of the memoranda of agreement between the agency and proprietors of such accommodation, proprietors are required to extend their public liability all-risks cover to the entire centre.

      <P>The measures I have published for the establishment of a new Garda inspectorate provide that it will deal with complaints by the public against members of the Garda Síochána. In that context the measures state that the inspectorate will consist of a person with experience, qualifications or expertise relevant to the functions to be carried out. In addition, it is envisaged that the appointment of the inspectorate will be undertaken by the Government upon resolutions passed by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The collection of fines, including those for speeding offences, was the subject of a report on the value for money examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General of December 2000, which was presented to Dáil Éireann pursuant to section 11 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993. This report noted that, in the year under review, 84% of on-the-spot fines for speeding were paid voluntarily. Where such fines are unpaid the cases may become the subject of legal proceedings and the courts may decide the outcome. On foot of an undertaking given by the Secretary General of my Department to the Committee of Public Accounts during its examination of the above report, a cross-agency high level group was established to examine all aspects of the management of the fines system and to make recommendations. This group's report will be submitted to the Committee of Public Accounts shortly.</P>

      <P>Section 18 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000 makes general provision for the granting of licences, subject to compliance with certain conditions, in respect of premises to which a full licence was never attached. In particular, the extinguishing of an existing licence in force in respect of other premises is required. On the granting of the new licence the Act provides that the existing licence shall be extinguished and the premises to which that licence was attached shall be deemed never to have been licensed. Normally, therefore, there would be no obstacle to applying for a licence in respect of a premises that had previously been licensed.</P>
      <P>However, my attention has recently been drawn to a case where certain provisions in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960 do not apparently permit such a resumption of trading in the original premises because the licence in question was used for the purposes of a public bar in a hotel. I have asked my Department to review existing legislation with a view to addressing identified shortcomings of this nature in the context of future amending legislation in the area of liquor licensing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 460 and 461 together.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's questions relate to section 6 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001, which provides that every person born in Ireland is entitled to be an Irish citizen. This feature of Irish citizenship law is unique in the European Union and unusual worldwide. In other EU member states the citizenship of a child born in that state is generally dependent on the citizenship of the parents and/or the status and duration of residence of the parents in the state concerned.</P>
      <P>The entitlement to citizenship by birth is also a constitutional right arising from Article 2 of the Constitution. Accordingly, a constitutional amendment would be required before any alteration of the existing statutory provision.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court, in its decision in the Fajujonu case [1990]2 IR 151, found that an Irish citizen child had the right to the company of its non-national parents and that such parents had a strong claim to be allowed to reside in the State for that purpose. In the past year there has been a significant increase in the number of applications from non-nationals to remain in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish citizen child. Applications to remain on this basis are potentially open to abuse. For example, there have been a number of instances where applicants submitted false claims of parentage of an Irish citizen. Accordingly, my Department is keeping this issue under review.</P>

      <P>Since I took office there has been significant investment in the Garda fleet which has expanded in size to a total of approximately 2,000 operational vehicles. These vehicles are assigned to Garda divisions throughout the country which in turn allocate the vehicles to their various districts and stations.

      <P>Provision is made in the Garda Vote each year for the purchase/delivery of vehicles for the Garda fleet and the maintenance of existing vehicles.

      <P>As is provided for under the terms of the Children Act, 2001, I will provide separate detention facilities for 16 to 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence. The Act was the subject of extensive consultations across a large number of Departments and the provision of these detention facilities is now the direct responsibility of the Prison Service. Two such facilities are to be provided, one in Cork and the other in the Dublin area. The provision of these facilities has been identified as a priority by the Prison Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preliminary work has already commenced on the Cork centre on a site adjacent to Cork Prison. With regard to the Dublin centre, the Pri<Col N="1613" /> son Service has in recent months been actively seeking a suitable location for the facility. It recently advertised seeking suitable sites and received a number of responses which are being examined.</P>
    <P>It is intended to complete this stage of the process in the near future and I expect construction to commence next year. While there have been no recent consultations with my ministerial colleagues regarding this phase of the project they, and their respective Departments, will be kept informed and consulted as required on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers under the system of dispersal and direct provision which was introduced in April 2000. Under this system, the agency provides full board accommodation to asylum seekers in a number of settings including hostels, guest houses and former hotels while their claims for refugee status are being determined. Persons granted refugee status are entitled to access housing of every tenure on the same basis as Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>The RIA currently has a portfolio of 76 accommodation centres and nine reception centres located across 24 counties. Each property used for providing accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers is inspected by officials from the agency prior to its use for the purpose of ascertaining its suitability. If, following such an inspection, a property is deemed suitable, a comprehensive memorandum of agreement is entered into by the proprietor and the agency. In the case of State owned properties, such agreements are entered into with management companies.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of these agreements, proprietors and management companies are required to ensure that the premises comply and operate in accordance with all statutory requirements of local authorities and other agencies in relation to planning, building by-laws, bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, sewage disposal, fire precautions and general safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inspectorate unit within the RIA conducts <Col N="1615" /> regular unannounced inspections of each location where asylum seekers are accommodated. Since the system of dispersal and direct provision was introduced in April 2000, at least three full day inspections have been carried out on each property in operation for the period and additional unannounced short duration inspections are carried out on an ongoing basis. Diminutions in standards which come to light as a result of such inspections are treated very seriously by the agency and can lead to termination of contracts where this is deemed to be warranted.</P>

      <P>Cork Corporation submitted a proposal to my Department in relation to the proposed redevelopment of Churchfield swimming pool. Cobh UDC also submitted a proposal for a replacement swimming pool in Cobh. The local authorities in these cases have submitted satisfactory financial plans and feasibility studies have been completed in each case. There is no proposal in my Department at present regarding a pool in Douglas.</P>
      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.</P>
      <P>Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be submitted, in the first instance, to the local authority concerned to obtain their support. The Department will only consider the proposal if it is submitted via the relevant local authority. Before supporting an application, the local authority would have to be satisfied that the proposal is viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project is available and that the project, when completed, will have a satisfactory level of access available to the general public. The local authority swimming pool programme does not provide financial support towards the running costs of swimming pools. Responsibility in this regard rests with the management authorities of the pool.</P>

      <Quest>if the amount of money to be allocated, per county, under the sports capital programme is determined prior to the final allocation of applications being decided; if not, the way in which the county allocations are determined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>All applications received under the sports capital programme are assessed on an individual basis by officials in the sports division of my Department in accordance with a detailed set of assessment criteria as specified in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme which are available on hard copy and on the Department's website at tourism-sport.irlgov.ie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the assessment process each application receives a score, which decides its order of priority within its own county. Regard is had to the population levels in each county and to providing a <i>pro rata</i> level of funding on that basis. Up to 2000, using this <i>pro rata</i> process, the number of <Col N="1619" /> projects funded in some counties and the level of grant awarded were unlikely to make a significant impact on the provision of facilities in that country. Therefore, in 2000, I decided to introduce a guaranteed minimum allocation of £200,000, 253,948, per county.</P>
    <P>However, the assessment process must also take into account existing levels of facilities in an area and also the strategic positioning of major facilities which may be required and the quality of applications received for such projects. Applications under the programme are received from organisations for local, regional and national facilities. Each year a number of major regional and national projects are allocated funding, the level of which may distort the total allocations to the counties in which they are located.</P>
    <P>Recommendations, based on the conclusions from the assessment process and having regard to the amount of funding available for distribution, are made by the sports division to me, as Minister, and I make the final decision on projects and grants to be allocated under the programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 488 and 489 together.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development were the agencies responsible for the administration of capital assistance for individual tourism products, including those located in heritage towns, under the Operational Programmes for Tourism 1998-1993 and 1994-1999, and for the assessment of applications for assistance under those programmes.</P>
      <P>Details of the value of grants to individual projects should be requested directly from the two agencies. However, I understand that under the two programmes some £11 million, 14 million, in European Regional Development Fund grants was allocated towards the presentation of the architectural, historical or mercantile heritage of 34 designated heritage towns.</P>
      <P>The external evaluator for the ongoing evaluation of the programme over the period 1994-1999, Fitzpatrick Associates, reported in April 1999 on the impact of the heritage town theme, Report No. 20. The report was one of three produced by them on the programme at the time and together they cost £22,698.</P>

      <P>I am aware of requests by school authorities for increased funding referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Blackstock report on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post primary schools. The recommendations made in the steering group's report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, and I am committed to bring greater equity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in the fund<Col N="1622" /> ing of our schools. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. Under the fund, a school with 500 pupils now receives additional annual funding of £20, 25.40, per pupil or £10,000, 12,697.38, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000, 5,078.96, per school.</P>
    <P>I have recently announced further significant increases in the support grant to schools. With immediate effect, the annual grant will be increased from £20, 25.40, per pupil to £50, 63.49, per pupil, with a further increase to £70, 88.88, per pupil next September and to £78, 99.04, per pupil in January 2003. The minimum annual grant for smaller schools will also be increased from £4,000, 5,078.96, to £15,600, 19,807.91; while schools with 500 pupils or more will rise from £10,000, 12,697.38, to £39,000, 49,519.79, over this school year and the next.</P>
    <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1979 scheme for the employment of school caretakers in the larger primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. The question of introducing a pension scheme for caretakers was explored fully in 1985, however, it was considered that the high age profile of caretakers at that time rendered the introduction of a pension scheme impractical. There are no plans at present to <Col N="1623" /> introduce such a pension scheme for caretakers employed in primary schools.</P>
      <P>The 1979 scheme has been superseded under the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive scheme that provides grants to primary and secondary schools towards the cost of caretaking services. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives schools discretion as to the manner in which caretaking services are provided. Caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role regarding how they are employed. These individualised arrangements preclude a central superannuation scheme.</P>
      <P>The funding arrangements for the VEC and C&amp;C school sectors at second level include provision for caretaking services to schools. Pension scheme provisions apply in both sectors to caretakers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of &ldquo;those most in need&rdquo; could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that s/he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
      <P>The three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level students attending approved courses in approved third level institutions funded by my Department are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant <Col N="1624" /> under one of these schemes, s/he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an individual applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>My Department has received an application for grant aid towards the cost of a building project at Annacarty national school.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the building programme at all levels. The allocation in the current year is £370.5 million, 470.4 million. This is almost four times the allocation made by the previous Government in 1997. This level of funding has enabled my Department to undertake a record number of building projects, and it is my intention to continue this rate of progress in overcoming the deficit arising from many past years and in meeting the needs of the present day.</P>
      <P>Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of individual projects, including Annacarty national school, will be taken as in previous years in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes in the forthcoming Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Education Act, 1998 sets out a clear statutory framework within which the Irish education sector can operate and continue to develop. The rights and roles of all the partners in education are clearly laid down in the Act. The Act also places considerable emphasis on the principle of partnership in the management and operation of our education sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 22 and 23 of the Act assign to each principal teacher responsibility for the instruction provided to students in the school. The functions <Col N="1627" /> of principals range from overseeing the day-to-day management of schools to providing leadership to staff and students. In keeping with the principle of partnership that underpins the Act, principals are asked to encourage the involvement of parents in the education of their children.</P>
    <P>The Act encourages principals to have due regard to the wishes of parents. However, another objective of the Act is to enhance the operation and management of schools, and to ensure schools are run in as effective a manner as possible, every principal must balance the wishes of individual parents with the needs of the school community when carrying out his or her functions.</P>
    <P>The rules and programme for secondary schools do not specifically state that school authorities should use the results of in-school tests to determine the level of the examination which junior or leaving certificate students may sit for in the various subjects. However, it would be expected that schools would use the results of such tests, allied to the views of the relevant teachers, and taking due account of the wishes of parents in allocating teaching resources to best suit the needs and abilities of each student.</P>
    <P>Junior and leaving certificate candidates, who are eligible to sit the examination, themselves make the choice of level at which a particular subject will be taken, normally on the advice of and on consultation with their subject teachers. They indicate this choice on a form, which is completed in the school, usually by 31 March of the year of the examination, and sent to the examinations branch of my Department. This practice means that the choice of level is not made by the candidate on the day of the examination, so that the danger of unwise decisions is avoided. However, in the event of a genuine mistake, the student may on the day of the examination, seek to change level and the examination superintendent, with the consent of the school authorities, will facilitate this change of mind.</P>
    <P>The Education Act does not include a specific channel of complaint which may be followed by parents aggrieved by such decisions taken by a school. In such cases parents are advised that they should appeal the decision to the board of management of the school in question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> A circular issued by my Department in 1999 advised all schools of the procedures to be followed in making application for support services in respect of children with special needs, including children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. All such applications are required to be supported by relevant assessment reports and to be submitted through the school's local inspector.</P>

      <P>All three schemes have broadly similar provisions, relating, for example, to age, residency and means, which govern the award of a grant.</P>
      <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue from my Department. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or <Col N="1633" /> VEC may in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>It is not open to me, or my Department, to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Until such time as an application has been decided on by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an individual application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF-aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>My Department's design team procedures apply in every case where the architectural planning of a project requires the engagement of a full design team to address the architectural, structural, services and cost control aspects of the proposal.</P>
      <P>These procedures consist of nine stages. The design and planning of the project are covered by stages 1 to 5, during which the project is developed from the assessment of site suitability, through the detailed design, including the obtaining of planning permission, to the point where detailed bills of quantities are prepared.</P>
      <P>At stage 6, tenders are sought in line with public procurement procedures and subsequently a tender report is prepared and examined. Assuming that the outcome of the tender process is acceptable in terms of procurement procedures, providing value for money and that funds are available to meet construction costs a construction contract is placed at that stage and the construction of the project begins.</P>
      <P>Stages 7 to 9 cover post contract cost control throughout the construction period, construction and practical completion of the building, including hand over of the building to the proposed occupiers and the completion of the cost analysis in the form of the final account, ensuring that cost control was maintained.</P>

      <P>A building project to provide three new classrooms and ancillary accommodation at the school in question was approved by the building unit of my Department and is currently at stage 3 of the architectural planning process. However, the school authorities recently requested that an additional classroom be included in the proposed building project. In the light of this request, a review of the accommodation requirements of the school is being carried out by the planning section of my Department. Factors such as demographic trends and availability of places in other schools in the area will be taken into consideration in the course of this review. A decision on this matter will be made and notified to the school authorities as soon as possible.</P>

My intention is to address the related problems of non-completion at second level education and low participation rates in higher education which are hampering development in these regions. I intend to put in place supports to encourage completion of the leaving certificate and to enable advancement to localised higher education opportunities. In this context, my Department received a number of proposals for the establishment of centres in various locations around the country, including a proposal from the Navan chamber of commerce for the establishment of a third level facility in Navan.</P>
      <P>Following further consideration of the matter, it has recently been decided to proceed with plans to develop centres in Wexford and Kilkenny. Proposals for similar initiatives in other areas, including Navan, will be reviewed in the light of the experience gained from the development of the centres in Wexford and Kilkenny and in the context of the resources which are available to me.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 524 and 525 together.</P>
      <P>My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions. These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees. The arrangements for the payment of maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme are a matter for the local authorities, which are statutorily entrusted with the administration of the scheme under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968.</P>
      <P>My Department understands from Roscommon County Council that the first instalment of maintenance grant for the 2001-02 academic year issued to successful applicants on 28 September 2001. County Roscommon vocational educational committee, which administers the VEC scholarship scheme, has confirmed that the first instalment of maintenance grant issued to successful applicants on 19 October 2001.</P>
      <P>While it is the vocational education committees that assess applications under the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, the third level institutions approved under the scheme are responsible for payment of the maintenance grants to individual students. Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme and the vocational scholarship scheme, maintenance grants are paid in three equal instalments as early as possible in each of the three terms of the academic year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, my Department has forwarded full details of this initiative to the local authorities and vocational education committees. Arrangements for payment of the special rates are a matter for those bodies. I am arranging to have the Deputy's query forwarded for the attention of Roscommon County Council and County Roscommon VEC, together with my reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1980s my Department, in conjunction with the Health Education Bureau and the Mater Dei Counselling Centre, organised annual drug and alcohol education courses for teachers. This provided the impetus for the initial drafting of classroom materials. In 1990 my Department and the Department of Health decided to proceed with further development of materials in conjunction with the Mater Dei counselling centre and with the support of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Materials were piloted in eight schools and the feedback was incorporated into the substance abuse prevention programme, On my Own Two Feet, which was introduced into post-primary schools in 1994. A similar programme, Walk Tall, was produced for use at primary level. These programmes have a particular focus on education about the use of alcohol and include substantial <Col N="1641" /> associated inservice training for teachers. These substance abuse programmes have been introduced into 95% of primary schools and 75% of post-primary schools. They are now being mainstreamed into social, personal and health education, SPHE. SPHE provides children with unique opportunities to learn about themselves, care for others and make informed decisions about their lives. This is the context in which it is considered that substance misuse is best addressed and not in a stand alone programme.</P>
    <P>This approach reflects the WHO European alcohol action plan, 2000-2005 which recommends providing, &ldquo;all young people with the opportunity to experience skill based learning through an integrated, holistic health education programme with a commitment to a safe and health-enhancing social and physical environment, (and) ensure that school based alcohol education . . . is integrated into the concept of the health promoting school&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This new subject is to be introduced into all primary schools by 2003. At post-primary level all schools are to have the new SPHE junior cycle syllabus in operation by 2003. The majority of schools already provide pupils with one class period per week in SPHE and will continue to do so using the new syllabus. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is preparing an SPHE syllabus for use in the senior cycle. The co-operation between my Department and the Department of Health and Children in developing these programmes and subjects and in providing an ongoing support service for them is important. An SPHE support service has been established on a regional basis, based on the health boards, with representatives from both the education and the health sectors.</P>
