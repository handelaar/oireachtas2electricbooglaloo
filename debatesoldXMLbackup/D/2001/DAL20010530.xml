      <P>We have been endeavouring on this side of the House to extract from this disputatious Government when it will bring forward the Report Stage amendments to the Children Bill which has been delayed for over a year in the House.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, a European Commissioner, Mr. Bolkenstein, told the Institute of European Affairs in Dublin that all member states had now agreed to the upward harmonisation of energy taxes and that this would involve an increase of 12p per litre in the price of petrol. He said that all euro countries had agreed, with the exception of Spain, and that Ireland had agreed to the principle of upward harmonisation but had not agreed the level. Would the Taoiseach inform the House if this is correct and would he also comment on the implied threat which was put on the table by the Commissioner that, if this was not accomplished satisfactorily by agreement in Europe, certain provisions of the Nice Treaty would be used to ensure that there would be an increase of 12p per litre in the price of petrol in the immediate future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply, would the Taoiseach outline the Government's general attitude to the principle of carbon taxes and energy taxes, in the light of Ireland's failure to meet the progress that we are required to make towards the Kyoto commitments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the last question first, we are committed to the implementation of the Kyoto agreements and will continue to work towards those guidelines, as I have stated many times. In reply to Deputy Noonan, the issue of energy taxes has been on the table for several years. It has been discussed in various forms and <Col N="545" /> is still before the ECOFIN Council, without any agreement on it. Ireland initially led the arguments against it, as did Spain. There has been some modification of the case being put more recently but there is still no agreement on the issue. The arrangements or plans have not been worked out. We have said that we are not against the overall principles, if we can work out a satisfactory arrangement. However, we are not now at that position and it is not correct to say that we are in the &lsquo;yes' group on this issue at this stage. We will maintain our position until we get a satisfactory agreement at the ECOFIN Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that Ireland has agreed to the principle of upward convergence, that it only remains now to set the level and that, unlike Spain, Ireland is not opposing this but has agreed the principle and that the level could be set in the coming months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just a question of the level. At an ECOFIN meeting some time back, the Minister for Finance said Ireland would not block this if there was a satisfactory arrangement. Spain took a different view. Apart from the level, other aspects such as the scheme, its operation and structure would have to be agreed before we would be in favour of it. There has been some speculation that this issue will come up in the next few weeks but I believe it will be several months before the proposal comes back in any form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, as the Minister for Finance who brought in the tax amnesty legislation of 1993, which was a last and final opportunity for tax cheats to come on side, must be aware that the Revenue Commissioners are effectively subverting the provisions of that Act in relation to the beneficial owners of bogus non-resident accounts. What action does the Government propose to take with regard to this flagrant abuse of legislation passed in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach in the strongest possible terms that Fine Gael is utterly opposed to anybody who availed of the amnesty taking advantage of the new arrangements in respect of the payment of DIRT. Does the Taoiseach agree with our view and will he take immediate steps to contact the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and to inform him that this House will not stand for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Noonan. The statement of practice is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, who are charged, under tax law, with the assessment and collection of taxes imposed by the State. I understand the Revenue Commissioners took legal advice and are satisfied that the terms of the statement of practice, as they set out on 2 May, are in accordance with their care and management powers under their existing legislation. I agree that a number of <Col N="546" /> issues which Deputies have raised should be clarified. I understand the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners is happy to clarify these matters and that he will appear before the Committee of Public Accounts shortly to deal with the Revenue operations generally. No doubt, the issues relating to the statement of practice will be raised in that context.</P>
      <P>I should point out also that, in its recent report, the Committee of Public Accounts which includes members from all sides of the House, recognised the scale of the task which the Revenue Commissioners have to deal with in the assessment and collection of the underlying tax in a pragmatic and effective manner, while safeguarding the overall revenue of the State. The Minister for Finance informed the House last week that he understood from of the Revenue Commissioners that those who availed of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act, 1993, may also avail of the arrangements under the statement of practice, but it does not apply to cases already under inquiry by Revenue on 2 May or coming within the scope of the Ansbacher investigations, the Flood tribunal, or the Moriarty tribunal. Those who did not properly avail of the 1993 Act &ndash; Deputy Quinn's point &ndash; will pay higher amounts now if they come within the statement of practice. The 1993 Act, for which I was responsible, stated that someone could comply then but would have no other opportunity. I stand over the terms of an Act which I brought through the Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it is incumbent on his Government and his Attorney General to give a clear interpretation of the law on what constitutes, in effect, a second illegal tax amnesty, on foot of what was brought through this House as a full and final settlement of the issue of tax cheats? It is not adequate for him to rest on the legal advice given to, and interpreted by, the Revenue Commissioners about their care and management provisions. The Taoiseach and this Government have a responsibility to ensure that what is in effect an additional amnesty is not given to the tax cheats who availed of bogus non-resident accounts. It is incumbent on him to satisfy himself that the law is being implemented properly. Our view, as set out in the recent article in <i>Magill</i> magazine, is that it is not being implemented properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into a debate over the Revenue Commissioners' powers or lack of them. They have legal advice and are satisfied with the terms of practice. The Minister for Finance accepts this. It is not an amnesty if a person must pay 100% of taxes and penalties. Anyone looking at what the Revenue is attempting must take that into account. The Minister for Finance indicated to the House last week that he understood from the Commissioners that those who availed of the waivers in the 1993 Act may make arrangements under the statement of <Col N="547" /> practice, but it does not apply to cases under inquiry by them, which may cover many cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Revenue Commissioners are rubbish, the Deputy can tell them so in the Committee of Public Accounts. It does not apply to those coming under inquiry by the Revenue Commissioners, the Ansbacher investigations, the Flood tribunal, or the Moriarty tribunal. Persons who did not properly avail of the 1993 Act will pay higher amounts if they come within the statement of practice. Other questions should be put to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners when he comes before the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 18, after &ldquo;including&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 refers to the interpretation section and, specifically, the queries that have been raised among carers and their representatives about some of the definitions in this Bill, particularly whether the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, including a civil servant within the meaning of the Civil Service Regulation Act, would cover members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. Both these categories have been included in the Parental Leave Act and in employment equality legislation. It seems strange that in this most vital legislation to extend health and relief to the estimated 120,000 carers, these important categories are not included. More than 25,000 families would not be able to gain the protection of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I have been asked to ask the Minister of State to specify how exactly he would define the term &ldquo;carer&rdquo;&ndash; in other words, how does he see &ldquo;carer&rdquo; operating in terms of the Carer's Leave Bill. How does the Minister of State interpret the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; which occurs many times throughout the Bill? How would he categorise a &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; ? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very welcome that we have reached this stage with the Carer's Leave Bill. I thank the Minister of State and his very hard working officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who I welcome here today and who have worked very hard on this legislation, particularly on and after Committee Stage. I welcome the fact the Minister of State accepted a number of Labour Party amendments on Committee Stage, specifically the commitment to have a system of review which is now in section 34. I welcome the steps the Minister of State has taken but I would encourage him to take a few more small steps, particularly to deal with some of the continuing restrictive elements of this legis<Col N="552" /> lation which we have highlighted in a number of the amendments before us.</P>
    <P>So far, only 186 people have applied and qualified for the carer's benefit. A major advance was promised in the Government's programme for Government four years ago, that was, to introduce an insurance based system where people engaged in full-time caring duties for an elderly relative or child could take time off work with the full protection of the law. The carer's benefit was introduced in late 1999 so it has taken nearly 18 months for us to reach Report Stage of this companion legislation, the Carer's Leave Bill. People have been applying for the carer's benefit through the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The carer's benefit has been in place for a year and a half but we still do not have the protection of the law for workers who have taken time off to avail of the carer's benefit. So far, approximately 190 workers have availed of the carer's benefit. I ask the Minister of State to look at the situation in which that couple of hundred workers find themselves in relation to this legislation.</P>
    <P>After the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo;, I ask the Minister of State to insert the words &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces&rdquo;, as in parental leave and other equality legislation. I would like to hear his views on the definition of a &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; and on the term &ldquo;carer&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Broughan's amendment. The inclusion of the words &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces&rdquo;, in this section, as proposed in the Deputy's amendment, is important, as their inclusion is not established. That is an omission. The Deputy's points regarding the definition of a carer and a relevant person are important. I am anxious to hear the Minister of State's position on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased we are finalising this legislation and I appreciate the constructive approach Deputies opposite have taken to bring it to fruition. This is important legislation as we are breaking new ground and that has been acknowledged by Members on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan's amendment seeks to include a reference to a member of the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces in this section. As I said on Committee Stage, and I again confirm, I am satisfied the Garda and the Defence Forces are included under the provisions of the Bill as drafted. Neither category is specifically mentioned in the text as being excluded, which implies they are covered by the provisions of the Bill. I do not, therefore, propose to accept the amendment as it is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Broughan asked for information on who would be defined as a relevant person. The term &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill because it is referred to in the Social Welfare Act. <Col N="553" /> Section 8(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, as inserted by section 10 of the Social Welfare Act, 2000, defines a relevant person as meaning a person other than the person in receipt of an increase of disablement pension under section 57 in respect of constant attendance who has such a disability that he or she requires full-time care and attention.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Broughan's last question, I got the following figures only this morning on the carer's benefit scheme as of 25 May. A total of 512 claims were received for carer's benefit, 214 claims were awarded, 177 claims were refused, 15 claims were terminated due to the death of the person being cared for, 22 claims were suspended where the carer returned to work, 5 claims were withdrawn, 79 claims are on hand, 41 claims related to non-resident people and 14 claims were refused which would have qualified for carer's leave. Figures on the claims awarded per county are as follows: Carlow, 5; Cavan, 3; Clare, 4; Cork, 20; Dublin, 51; Galway, 25; Kerry, 10; Kildare, 6; Kilkenny, 1; Leitrim, 3; Limerick, 5; Longford, 3; Louth, 5; Mayo, 12; Meath, 5; Monaghan, 3; Offaly, 11; Roscommon, 4; Sligo, 8; Tipperary, 6; Waterford, 4; Westmeath, 6; Wexford, 4; and Wicklow, 10, making up a total of 214. Figures are still being compiled.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that many people are availing of carer's leave and it is important that we are dealing with this legislation today. Members have been helpful in trying to make sure the legislation is enacted as quickly as possible. This legislation will provide a new service in the home for people who need full-time care and attention and I am pleased my officials have processed it as quickly as possible. Many members of the public would appreciate the introduction of a new measure of care and a new opportunity for people to be cared for in the home by those who wish to take a break from the workplace.</P>
    <P>We will go through the legislation section by section. I listened to many of the contributions made and I accepted some Opposition amendments on Committee Stage. We are finalising the Bill today and this is productive work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the information the Minister of State has given. More than 214 people have applied for carer's benefit, but they will not have the protection of this legislation. On the basis of the statistics given by the Minister of State, does the Department have any indication of the number who may eventually take up the carer's benefit scheme? The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs speculated that eventually 5,000 may apply for this benefit. Members on all sides of the House agree there are at least 50,000 full-time carers. Of those, some 17,000 are in receipt of the carer's allowance, a few hundred are in receipt of the carer's benefit and presumably that number will grow, but the majority of full-time carer's are not in receipt of any State supports. Such carers seek to avail of <Col N="554" /> this type of scheme, the carer's allowance or increasingly they call for a new carer's payment. Has any progress been made on addressing that group of carers? </P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's definition of a relevant person. He did not include a definition of carer in the Bill. While he might say those definitions are covered in social welfare legislation, workers and their trade union representatives are anxious that those definitions should be included in this legislation or that we find out on the floor of the House who the Minister of State considers is a full-time carer to ensure there is no ambiguity when a case goes to a rights commissioner or beyond.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>We are introducing legislation in relation to the workplace to allow the rights of the worker who wishes to give full-time care and attention to a person to be protected in law. The definitions the Deputy seeks to include in the legislation are part of the social welfare legislation. Effectively, a carer will be a person who looks after a relevant person and that carer would have to be in a position to give that person full-time care and attention. The Deputy will have heard from the statistics I quoted that some people did not qualify for the carer's benefit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the case and that will be provided for. The person being cared for will need full-time care and the person providing the care must be in a position to provide that full-time care. All adjudication on who qualifies for what are made by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The relevant points the Deputy made, which he also made in committee, relate to that Department. I will share with the Deputy any information I have on that area. Our job, as legislators, is to ensure the rights of workers who wish to take time off work to care for persons are protected under the law. The Bill covers carers who do not reside with the persons they care for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the comments of the Minister of State regarding the number of people seeking this entitlement and that this Bill will be enacted as quickly as possible. I have received several calls regarding the urgent need to introduce this legislation. In the absence of it being in place can employers avail of this legislation, in theory, so to speak, by granting such leave on a discretionary basis? Some employers are doing that, which is to be welcomed and encouraged. Employees have approached their employers to seek carer's leave in the absence of this legislation being in place, which I hope will not be the case for too much longer. It is important that a clear commitment is given in order that people can avail of this provision which is currently at the <Col N="555" /> discretion of employers. It is important also that there is a good relationship with employers and co-operation between the State, employees and employers in the long term. Regardless of the enactment of the legislation, it is important that this is a workable document. Companies should have a role to play in regard to job creation because they depend very much on having a good workforce. A good understanding of when people can take leave is also important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister of State said and his good faith on these issues. He has covered the definition of &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; and given us some guidance in the legislation, including the social welfare legislation, on what is a carer. I would prefer to specify &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces&rdquo;. Given that this was done in the parental leave and other equality legislation I do not understand the reason it cannot be the case in this legislation. I notice there are other restrictions in the legislation by comparison with the parental leave legislation. I ask the Minister of State to consider these two words.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 22, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including regulations applying to persons whose period of leave commenced prior to the passing of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the statistics given by the Minister of State. I heard my party leader, the Taoiseach and the leader of Fine Gael on the Order of Business discussing what was done in regard to tax affairs in the past. In general the House finds it difficult to retrospectively consider legislation. The issue here is the couple of hundred people and their families to whom the Minister of State has alluded who, through no fault of their own, have not been given the protection of the Carer's Leave Bill which is extraordinary. I exclude the Minister of State from this but, in general, the Government has been lethargic in regard to the legislation concerned, that is, the Social Welfare Act, 2000, and the Carer's Leave Bill 14 or 15 months later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many promotions and leaflets from the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. I have in front of me a publication entitled, Information on Carer's Allowance: Keeping You Informed, from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. This document which was published last year includes a very helpful page on carer's benefit. It refers to the 65 week period and the conditions relating to PRSI and the employment period, one of which is at odds with the legislation. In my Labour Party role, I have been chasing the Minister, Deputy <Col N="556" /> Ahern, in relation to providing information on how to receive carer's benefit and so on. The document is very clear, well written and a tribute to the civil servants in the Department. The net effect is that it will have encouraged workers in dire circumstances looking after elderly parents or severely disabled teenagers. Some of these cases came to my attention when I addressed the Care Alliance Conference of Ireland a few weeks ago. It indicates that we have an obligation to those who have applied for carer's benefit but do not have the protection of carer's leave.</P>
    <P>Deputy Perry is correct when he says that the legislation will be most effective in well run companies and businesses where workers, supervisors and managers have a friendly, co-operative and efficient working relationship. In some of these companies managers will have already indicated that they will adhere to the essential conditions of the legislation. Nevertheless the bottom line is that a couple of hundred citizens, a number which is growing, will not have the protection of the Carer's Leave Bill. My amendments, Nos. 2 and 3, seek to give the Minister of State a chance to make some provision for the protection of these citizens who have applied for carer's benefit and met the conditions of the Department and the Social Welfare Act, 2000 but do not have the protection of this legislation. I ask the Minister of State who has taken a sympathetic role throughout these discussions to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>I share the Ceann Comhairle's words of welcome to our distinguished guests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> I understand from where Deputy Broughan is coming. I am sure he will appreciate however that I do not have the power to deal with the situation. He is seeking to cover situations whereby employees with the agreement of their employers will have taken leave to care for a person requiring full-time care and attention prior to the passing of the Bill and in this regard provide that such leave will be carer's leave for the purposes of the Bill. While it may be desirable that employees in such circumstances would have the protection afforded by the Bill applied to them in respect of leave taken prior to the passing of the Bill I am advised that it would be in breach of natural justice to impose retrospective obligations on employers who would, in fairness, have acted in good faith by allowing their employees to take leave to which there was not a statutory entitlement at the time. If the employee was to be penalised by the employer, for example, by dismissal, he or she would always have access to redress in respect of their contract of employment under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>I gave the Deputy the figures that have emerged with regard to people availing of this scheme earlier and I stress that what is happening now is by agreement. My difficulty here is that I cannot force or oblige employers to act in a certain way. Clearly, the sooner we get this legislation in place the better and I appreciate the Deputy's co-operation. If there is a particular problem with regard to dismissal there is, as I mentioned, the Unfair Dismissals Act. I understand the Deputy's difficulty but my hands are tied on this and I hope the agreements in place will hold and we get our legislation in place as soon as possible. From here on there will be a compulsion on all concerned to abide by the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received correspondence from people in this precise situation all round the country and most other Deputies have been inundated with similar requests. This area is of growing concern and it is a unique situation. Again, I go back to the Minister's programme for Government where he made commitments to carers arising out of the relationship that some had with the carers' association and other national bodies that advocate the rights of carers, going back to the late 1980s and early 1990s. My understanding is that there was a commitment to have brought in the legislation required. To qualify for carer's benefit one must meet certain requirements and the necessary legislation for that went through the social welfare system &ndash; the Social Welfare Bill, 2000 &ndash; and then there was the protection of leave from work legislation which went through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

    <P>I do not issue caveats in relation to the officials here today because I know how hard they have worked and they have briefed myself and our <Col N="558" /> Fine Gael colleagues very well on this particular legislation. Nonetheless, it is a fact that the Carer's Benefit Bill has been sitting there for almost 18 months but the protective legislation is not there. The job of Government is to make sure things happen. What we need is joined up Government where Departments work closely together. In that ideal world the social welfare part of this legislation, the Social Welfare Bill, 2000, would have cleared the decks for the Carer's Leave Bill to have been brought through the House as quickly as possible this time last year at the latest. Within weeks of the Social Welfare Bill, 2000, going through, this legislation could have been passed. We have had all sorts of legislation moved forward but most people would agree that carers have probably received the least recognition. They are a most heroic group of citizens.</P>
    <P>I would still like to put this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree on that point. It is relevant that people would be in care without the cover of legislation. It is important that there would be a working relationship with employers but it is a fact that this legislation is very much needed. There are many carers in the country who never get a break and a study published recently showed there is a lack of awareness among carers regarding support services and entitlements. It is important that all the benefits and the entitlements that will follow should be built into this Bill.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to finally clarify this. I understand the position with regard to people availing of carer's benefit &ndash; the total number is over 200 in the country with 51 in Dublin. It is by agreement. I accept that it would be ideal if we could have brought in the Carer's Benefit and the Carer's Leave Bills together. Unfortunately the system does not work as quickly as we would like. There are various reasons for this. Perhaps the Deputies will understand that when they get their opportunity as Ministers, if the occasion arises. We have to deal with the procedures we are given. Workers and employers are agreed and I would be confident that in the majority of cases these agreements would be honoured. I appeal to all concerned to honour them. What we are doing is putting legal strength behind those agreements. My hands are tied with regard to retrospection. I would like to help out but I just cannot introduce retrospective legislation. I do, however, make an appeal to those concerned that the agreements made would be honoured. The numbers are quite small as I mentioned already, 200 for the country and 51 for Dublin.</P>

      <Col N="561" /> Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding <i>subsection (1)</i>, the Minister may by regulation allow two employees to share the caring role between them while remaining in the workforce on a part-time basis.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the fact that conditions relating to entitlement to carer's leave do not cover the possibility of more than one person carrying out the caring function. It is common in communities for a number of people to care for an aged or disabled relative. However, it also frequently happens that one member of a family, for historic reasons, because they are the oldest, the youngest or the person who has remained longest at home, is left to carry the whole burden of care, often on a seven days a week, 24 hours a day basis.</P>
      <P>One of the key ambitions of the carer's movement is legislation that would encourage all members of an extended family to participate in the care of elderly relatives. I ask the Minister, therefore, to consider accepting this amendment, which would provide for the possibility of two employees sharing the caring role and, if they are employed by different employers, of reaching an agreement on part-time working. In this way, the caring function could be recognised in legislation and carer's benefit could be paid for the period during which the carers were not working.</P>
      <P>I saw an interesting report on the 35-hour week in France, which seems to be very successful. It recognises today's much more complex society by allowing people proper respite and time for recreation and family. In that context we need to anticipate future multifaceted ways of working, by sharing jobs and introducing shorter working weeks to facilitate families. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs launched an interesting report on the development of the family section of his Department, which is now recognised as crucial, as a full Department in its own right. I commend the Government for that. It is an achievement for which it deserves recognition. In terms of emphasising the family, it would be a simple step forward in the context of this legislation to allow for the possibility of more than one member of a family sharing the caring function and, if it is approved, to recognise it in allocating carer's benefit and in the protection of carer's leave legislation. In that context I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>That it is a very good point. Patterns of working have changed. Two members of a family may wish to share the responsibility of caring and two different companies may be involved. The entitlement to leave is low. This amendment would allow those people to maintain a job with <Col N="562" /> an income and get an allowance to cover the time spent caring for a family member. The benefit to the State is great if somebody can remain at home and be cared for by family members rather than have to go into a nursing home.</P>
      <P>We are extraordinarily lucky that families and relations are prepared to help and to take time off from their paid employment to do so. It should be remembered that the minimum wage will increase to £176 per week so the entitlement on carer's leave will be small. Even if people wish to take carer's leave, it might not be financially viable for them to do so. They might have no choice, however, and this could put them under financial strain so there is huge merit in the suggestion that two members of the family might share the responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of sharing the caring was raised by a number of Deputies on Second Stage. Deputy Broughan put down an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage and I said I would consider the issue in detail. I appreciate the reason for the proposal, namely, to take pressure off carers who give up their jobs to look after loved ones in often trying and difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>However, the proposal in section 6(1)(<i>d</i>) mirrors the parallel Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs carer's benefit scheme. Any change permitting two persons to provide the care would cause administrative difficulties for the Department in monitoring possible abuses and for employers generally. Section 6(1)(<i>d</i>) provides that an employee who avails of carer's leave can engage in employment or self-employment in accordance with the regulations made by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs under section 82(<i>b</i>)(iii) of Chapter 11A of Part II of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993. These regulations allow such employees to work for up to ten hours per week.</P>
      <P>I cannot go further than this in the Bill. In earlier discussions with the IBEC on the Bill, it asked that this provision be spelt out clearly in the various information leaflets to be issued following enactment of the Bill. My officials have also informed the ICTU of this commitment. We will fulfil that commitment and provide this information. This arrangement provides a suitable compromise for both employees on carer's leave and for their employers who may wish to avail of a valued employee's service on a part-time basis while the employee is on carer's leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advice of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is that the amendment would be difficult to administer. This provision, however, recognises the need for the employee to do some part-time work while on carer's leave. They are allowed to do ten hours such work under the social welfare legislation. It is recognition of the need of the employee to do some work and of the needs of employers who may wish to avail of the employee's services. I presume the employee would make arrangements for the rela<Col N="563" /> tive to be looked after for that period. That is as far as I can go on the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on the possibility of part-time work but I still think a society must respond to the circumstances in which families find themselves. This proposal is an attempt to do that in a family friendly manner and to recognise the reality that many families have experienced. Members participating in this debate have probably experienced circumstances where one sibling might care for an ill parent for a certain length of time, another sibling takes over for a further period and another does the caring at the weekend to give the others a respite. That is the reality of the caring function and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not give sufficient recognition to the nature of caring.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has gone so far but I am unhappy that he has not gone the full distance and accepted the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding <i>subsection (1),</i> where an employee will not have completed one year's continuous employment with his or her employer on the date of commencement of a period of carer's leave, but has completed 3 months of such employment on the date of commencement of a period of such leave provided for by this subsection, the person shall, subject to this Act, be entitled to carer's leave for a period of 5 weeks for each month of continuous employment that he or she has completed with the employer at the time of the commencement of the leave.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a lengthy debate on this amendment on Committee Stage. It is one of the key amendments before the House. It seeks to provide a <i>pro rata </i>allocation of carer's leave to a carer where the carer has not served a full 12 months in his or her employment. I based the amendment on the relevant provision in the Parental Leave Act, 1998, which provides that where an employee has not completed one year's continuous employment with his or her employer but has completed three months of such employment, the employee is entitled to parental leave for a period of one week for each month of continuous employment completed with the employer concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment provides for five weeks carer's leave for each month of continuous employment he or she has completed with the employer at the time of the commencement of the leave. The Labour Party believes the provision in the Bill is unduly restrictive. An example of a relevant situation is where a worker has had a lengthy <Col N="564" /> relationship with a company or with a part of the public service and has a good PRSI record. The person might have worked in that body for 15 or 20 years and easily qualifies for carer's benefit in terms of the insurance conditions. However, he or she might have changed jobs, has less than 12 months' service with the new employer and finds that despite his or her excellent insurance record he or she is not eligible for carer's leave. A person might have between nine and 11 months' service but is still not eligible for a portion of the leave.</P>
    <P>The legislation is still unduly restrictive in that regard. We should be prepared to allow workers after a three month period to be eligible for a <i>pro rata</i> period of carer's leave. This matter was discussed on Committee Stage but that Stage was somewhat rushed so it is good we will have a little longer today to tease out the remaining points. In the current employment market people are likely to change jobs more often so a situation can arise in a family where somebody suddenly becomes ill and requires full-time care but the prospective carer, despite having an outstanding work and insurance record, could be unable to avail of carer's leave and the protection provided by the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a model available in the Parental Leave Act and in some of the equality legislation. It would be fitting, therefore, to accept this key amendment and provide for a similar <i>pro rata</i> system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is merit in this amendment. I am an employer. It is essential that there is good co-operation between the employer and the employee. In a case where it is clearly established by medical opinion that care is necessary, the employer should have discretion to permit <i>pro rata</i> leave. It would allow some compassion. I know the Bill is compassionate in many areas. Consideration should be made for the fact that the person would have PRSI contributions from other employment and a satisfactory record of employment prior to commencing his or her current employment. It would be important that there would be provision for discretion regarding the entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked again at this since Committee Stage. It would not be reasonable to allow employees with less than 12 months' service a <i>pro rata</i> entitlement to carer's leave as provided for under the Parental Leave Act, 1998. The period of parental leave entitlement is a much shorter period. In that case, it is 14 weeks as opposed to 65 weeks for carer's leave. It is not unreasonable, therefore, that an employee should have shown some commitment to an employer in terms of length of service before he or she can claim carer's leave. In that context it is reasonable that the current provision in the Bill involves a 12 month continuous employment requirement, which I stress is similar to the qualifying period contained in much of our other employment rights legislation. When I compare it to other <Col N="565" /> legislation, I am talking about legislation like the Unfair Dismissals Act and other similar legislation.</P>
      <P>We discussed this at some length on Committee Stage. I have tried my best to provide for balance in the legislation. It is balanced, if one looks at it in its totality, in favour of the employee. In this case there clearly must be some balance between the rights of the employee and the employer. Therefore we are saying that it is reasonable that there be that commitment of 12 months by the employee to an employer before he or she avails of this. Clearly there is always provision for agreement between an employer and employee in all circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there discretion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards discretion, when it comes to the law one must have clarity. Therefore there is no grey area with regard to that particular point but there is always provision for agreement. In the cases of people who have availed of this excellent scheme I instanced earlier, as we have seen, people have reached agreements. To be fair to all concerned here, I must stick to my position. Unfortunately, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disappointing the Minister did not address one of the kernel points I made, which is that the Department tries to encourage mobility in the workforce. For example, important skilled workers in the IT sector in particular and in areas like chemical engineering tend to change jobs regularly. It is one of those areas where we need to clearly indicate, probably in the Constitution, the absolute rights of carers. It is one area where less important rights are being placed in front of their right in this regard. <Col N="566" /> Clearly we are talking about an emergency arising with a child, an elderly parent or a sibling where the employee, who would have an outstanding insurance record, is immediately plunged into a full-time caring role every minute he or she is not working. In such circumstances this amendment would provide a respite. How often would such a situation arise? It would not be something on which a person would embark without serious cause.</P>
      <P>My party leader, Deputy Quinn, introduced a Bill on socio-economic rights. We wanted to provide full protection for the fundamental rights which families and members of society such as carers should enjoy. Indeed, every time I talk to carers, their main request is for full recognition. Sadly in this area the Minister is not prepared to give them full recognition. If he was prepared to do so, he would be prepared to look at the totality of somebody's contribution to the workforce and not let the request for carer's leave hinge on the person's current period of employment.</P>
      <P>I hope we will make fundamental efforts over the coming years, perhaps in the next Dáil, to ensure that the role of carers is placed at the heart of the Constitution and not just set out in legislation. The amendment addresses a key point. Perhaps it is one of the two or three most important remaining amendments. For that reason I press the Minister on the issue. I do not think he is recognising two aspects of the matter. First he is not recognising the nature of the busy modern economy, where the workforce is highly mobile and, second, he is not recognising the nature of caring, the fact that emergencies arise and people suddenly find themselves in a different world, providing constant care to a dear relative. I ask the Minister again to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like some clarification on this substitution which Deputies may find confusing. Section 7(2) provides that an employee may, while on carer's leave in respect of a relevant person, apply for carer's leave for another person if that person resides with the relevant person. However section 7(5) provides that an employee who is on carer's leave in respect of a relevant person and who is entitled to carer's leave in respect of a second relevant person shall not make another application for carer's leave in the circumstances referred to in subsection (2). These provisions appear to be contradictory. Is the Minister of State clearly indicating that if an employee in receipt of carer's leave applies for carer's leave for a second person who resides with the relevant person he or she will be covered by the provision in regard to the entitlement to carer's leave?</P>

    <P>Amendments Nos. 7 and 9 are Government amendments of a purely technical nature which are aimed at improving the effectiveness of the Bill. While section 7 was not specifically raised on Committee Stage it was felt, following discussions with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, that some redrafting of the text at subsections (4) and (5) was required for the purpose of clarity. Amendment No. 9 will improve the effectiveness of section 7(5) and go some way towards addressing Deputy Broughan's concern on that subsec<Col N="569" /> tion.

      <P>I welcome amendment No. 7 which proposes the substitution of the word &ldquo;takes&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;is entitled to&rdquo;. This will strengthen the position of workers who take carer's leave. I am not sure the Minister of State has addressed the problem I was attempting to identify in the previous amendment in regard to the need to clearly indicate that carers who apply for carer's leave for a second person will be covered by the provision in section 6 in regard to the entitlement to carer's leave. I am not sure this has been spelt out although I acknowledge that the Department has gone some way towards it. The issue around subsection (2) appears to remain. The relevant person may apply for carer's leave for another person if that person resides with the relevant person. I am not clear whether that person is covered by section 6. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the final position in regard to such a person.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 1, to delete &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;objective&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A brief debate took place on the issue of reasonable grounds on Committee Stage. It is considered in legal terminology that the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; has too broad a connotation and that a more specific connotation on the grounds on which carer's leave would be taken would be covered by the word &ldquo;objective&rdquo;. A person in a family who urgently needs full-time care would create a situation where the granting of carer's <Col N="570" /> leave would be clear cut. What we sought to do in the amendments was to look for more specific grounds. The term &ldquo;objective grounds&rdquo; in a good deal of employee protection legislation has been clearly defined by the European Court of Justice. From that point of view it is probably a broader ground and more protective of employees' rights than simply the use of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. I am advised that &ldquo;objective&rdquo; would be a better connotation in section 8 and also in the other relevant section later in the Bill. It refers specifically to the whole issue of taking leave of less than 13 weeks duration, a matter which was discussed in some detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister to the situation in which families often find themselves. On the last amendment I referred to how an emergency can arise in the case of an elderly parent or a disabled child or sibling where somebody would have to move fast to try to discharge the caring function and to look after the relative. It is important in law that that be indicated in as broad terms as possible. It is relevant to the previous amendment also in that it is an attempt to give further recognition to carers in that it specifies that caring is an unique and fundamental role in society and, indeed, it is the whole background to the Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to some of the amendments, including this one, people are thinking about how the economy and businesses would perform when workers take carer's leave. Organisations such as the Carer's Association, the Limerick Carers and Care Alliance Ireland estimate that possibly £2.5 billion to £3 billion worth of work is done by carers which is unrecognised. Last year the carer's allowance amounted to £50,000 or a little more. I am not sure what it is running at this year. For a tiny proportion of expenditure the State is obtaining ten or 15 times the amount of work from the carers of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Although &ldquo;objective&rdquo; is only a single word, it has a more precise connotation because it would enable us to look at the broader issues about caring and the kind of issues I have mentioned, including the vital nature of caring to a family, the community and society generally. That would have to be borne in mind in section 8(2) where a person may have to take carer's leave urgently. In that case that would have to be considered. Our legal adviser in the Labour Party, people in business and our trade union colleagues have given me different viewpoints on the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; which is a good word but on balance it was considered that &ldquo;objective&rdquo; would be a better word in terms of protecting workers' rights. It may sound arcane but it is a precise legal point and it was considered on balance that &ldquo;objective&rdquo; might be a better word.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take amendments Nos. 10, 11, 17, 24 and 25 together as they are all closely related. Deputies will be aware that sections 8(2) and 9(8) were the subject of Government amendments on Committee Stage which involved the insertion of &ldquo;reasonable <Col N="571" /> grounds&rdquo; in the text. These were included following representations from ICTU after Second Stage. There was a general consensus that these were welcome amendments as they gave a comfort factor to employees whose employer, before the amendments, could have refused without reason to grant carer's leave of less than 13 weeks duration or to treat the leave as carer's leave.</P>
      <P>Since Committee Stage ICTU has requested that &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; be changed to &ldquo;objective grounds&rdquo; which has been defined by the European Court of Justice. I have consulted with the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government who has advised that &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; gives greater flexibility to employees. That is our advice. I consider that the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is more appropriate in the context of the employee. Therefore, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 10 and 24 and ask Deputy Broughan to accept my reassurance based on my advice.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 would not effect any substantive change to the Bill. It is unnecessary as its potential effect has already been achieved by the current text. I do not propose to accept that amendment.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendments Nos. 17 and 25, Deputies will recall that section 8(7) and the latter part of section 9(8) were new provisions inserted on Committee Stage by way of Government amendments. However, following further consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government since Committee Stage on 11 April 2001 it was felt that the inclusion of these provisions was unnecessary. Referring to disputes in some sections of the Bill and not in others would cause unnecessary confusion. Any dispute arising as a result of section 8(2) or 9(4) respectively will constitute a dispute under section 17 and as such be referable to a rights commissioner. I hope I have clarified those points, the most important of which is whether to use the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; or &ldquo;objective&rdquo;. My advice is that the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; gives greater flexibility and that would be very much in the employee's interest.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Perry that &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is a reasonable word. Arising from this legislation, if court proceedings arose, I fear the conditions under which a carer worked may not be sufficiently taken into account. We felt the word &ldquo;objective&rdquo; would narrow this down to specific items, which the carers and their representatives could analyse in greater depth. Because of the nature of caring, it is a word that might be preferable.</P>
      <P>Why is the Minister not prepared to allow amendment No. 11? This is a simple amendment, which allows for the case where an employee, having been refused a period of carer's leave, which is less than 13 weeks duration, may refer the matter to a rights commissioner under section 19. On the last day, I welcomed some of the improvements the Minister made in this regard. I also take on board the fundamental point he makes that mentioning the right to appeal to a rights commissioner in every section of the Bill might not be necessary. However, this is an important issue. Somebody faced with an emergency may within hours want to consider the possibility of taking carer's leave. Where such leave is less than 13 weeks duration and is refused, there is no direct indication here that there is any possibility of serious review. I intend to press amendments Nos. 10 and 11.</P>

      <P>This was raised before and refers to the provision whereby a person shall not be entitled to commence a further period of carer's leave in respect of the same relevant person until a period of six weeks has elapsed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the six weeks gap between periods of carer's leave for the same relevant person is to give employers time to recruit and train replacement staff. An amendment passed on Committee Stage in relation to section 9(2) page 10 line 36 recognises emergency situa<Col N="573" /> tions in relation to giving notice of application for carer's leave. Given the differences of approach between the ICTU and IBEC on the issue, I am satisfied the six weeks requirement strikes the right balance all round for both employers and employees.</P>
      <P>The Bill as drafted requires employees to go through the procedures as set down in section 6(5) before obtaining a second period of carer's leave for the same relevant person. The inclusion of the amendment is therefore unnecessary and such a requirement would be likely to be interpreted by employees as being excessively bureaucratic. If employers have concerns regarding whether the relevant person is still in need of full time care and attention, they are of course free to use the provision of section 18.

The Bill as drafted requires employees to go through the procedure set down in section 6(5) of the Bill before obtaining a second period of carer's leave for the same relevant person.

      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 10 to 14 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where an employee has taken carer's leave in respect of a relevant person and that period of carer's leave has terminated&ndash;</P>
      <P>(a) the employee shall not commence carer's leave in respect of another relevant person until six months has elapsed since the termination of the previous period of carer's leave; or</P>
      <P>(b) in exceptional circumstances when another relevant person requires full-time care and atttention prior to the lapse of 6 months, the employee shall be permitted to commence carer's leave in respect of another relevant person when 4 weeks has elapsed since the termination of the previous period of carer's leave.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to delete subsection (4) which states that where the employee has taken carer's leave in respect of the relevant person and the period of carer's leave has terminated, the employee shall not commence carer's leave in respect of another relevant person until a period of six months has elapsed. The amendment retains the essential point but adds paragraph (<i>b</i>) that, in exceptional circumstances when another relevant person requires full-time care and atttention prior to the lapse of six months, the employee shall be permitted to commence carer's leave in respect of another relevant person when four weeks has elapsed since the termination of the previous period of carer's leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key element is the provision for exceptional circumstances. In cases where carers are looking after two elderly parents, one of them may be ill and the other may also become ill. Many of our recognised 17,000 to 18,000 carers could find themselves in those circumstances. This touches on the fundamental caveat of the Labour Party that this Bill does not go far enough <Col N="575" /> to totally embrace the nature of caring in the work system. I spoke earlier of the need to allow for two siblings share the carer's benefit, to share carer's leave and be able to work on a part-time basis, having regard to the nature of caring and the unexpected emergencies that can arise. In a case in my constituency, a person's spouse had a very serious long-term disability, her son had developed a similar disability and now a granddaughter has developed the same disability. Fortunately in this case the Northern Area Health Board of the Eastern Regional Health Authority has provided care and respite for the three relevant persons. However, enormous demands are made in terms of caring in those circumstances and that is why I urge the Minister of State to be more flexible in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is the Labour Party's intention that if we are in a position in the next Dáil to influence Government policy, the rights of carers will be one of our six or seven major priorities, including the delivery of necessary constitutional change. We tried to do this earlier through Deputy Quinn's amendment on social and economic rights. It is necessary to set a headline for society in terms of the support which health boards and the health system generally give to carers. In the overall economic context, the State should regard it as a priority to provide the resources to ensure that carers are themselves taken care of. This amendment reflects the Labour Party's objectives in that regard.</P>
    <P>Provision should be made for the exceptional circumstances to which I have referred, where another relevant person needs full-time care. The issue calls for a spirit of generosity, while recognising that the business and public sectors have to work efficiently. I can understand why the Minister of State is adhering to his position with regard to the timeframes provided for in the Bill, including the 12 months and six months periods. However, I suggest that we also recognise the rights of workers who want to partake of carer's benefit as full-time carers for an extra short period. I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">

      <P>I wish to refer briefly to amendment No. 15 which is intended to provide that the total number of periods of carer's leave taken by any person shall not exceed 130 weeks. The provisions of this Bill in relation to carers are very much needed. However, from the point of view of a company employing staff, the practicalities must be taken into account. Where a staff member might be on leave for 130 weeks, or over two years, the permanency of entitlement to re-employment needs to be reassessed. The interests of both the carer and the patient who is being cared for have to be considered. We should avoid a situation where an employee would see himself or herself as a permanent carer for the sake of having the security of a job and availing of the caring facility. We must be sure. If it is not prop<Col N="576" /> erly controlled some may look for people for whom to care. They could be permanently in the caring role because they receive the funds. They may prefer this way of life.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 14 in the name of Deputy Broughan reflects the wish of the ICTU to have the period reduced to four weeks in line with the carer's benefit scheme while amendment No. 12 reflects IBEC's view that it be extended to eight weeks for continuity. I am coming up the middle in proposing six weeks. Section 8(4) of the Bill provides that where an employee took and terminated a period of carer's leave in respect of a relevant person he or she may not commence a period of leave in respect of another relevant person until six months has elapsed since the termination of the leave in respect of the former relevant person. I am not accepting amendment No. 14.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 15, I do not propose to restrict the number of times carer's leave can be taken by individual employees. That would be unreasonable and against the Bill's spirit and intent. It is accepted by all interested parties, including the Deputies present, as being innovative social legislation which allows employees time off work to look after a sick or elderly person at a trying and difficult time. It would not be right to restrict the number of times a worker can take carer's leave. Decisions to take leave will not be taken lightly as the relevant person requiring full-time care and attention will already have been medically assessed by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Placing restrictions would not facilitate urgent and emergency situations. Accordingly I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, did not travel far along the road with us but he did come to 65 weeks, the 15 months period. This raises the point of a discussion in which I was involved last night. Like other colleagues, I attended the celebration for the departing director of the Combat Poverty Agency, Mr. Hugh Frazer, to whom I pay tribute. He directed the Combat Poverty Agency for 14 years, from its initial period through three chairpersons and many boards. He developed the NAP strategy and put Ireland at the forefront of EU countries battling poverty. He is taking on a European role. This Friday is the day when the 15 countries must submit their poverty plans to the European Union and it will be Hugh's role to assess them. I pay tribute to his achievement in the public service.

      <P>The discussion was about the social insurance fund from which the complementary carer's benefit that runs with this legislation arises. There were significant surpluses of perhaps £600 million or £700 million. Those who work in the third sector of the economy, the social area, believe that the benefits a person receives from the insurance contributions he or she pays are limited. There are three or four basic benefits, although the free schemes are now included. We should be more open to the specific needs of carers and the fact that emergencies can spring on someone forcing him or her to take significant time out of the workforce. In such circumstances, an employer should allow someone to take another period of carer's leave when four weeks have elapsed. That is the nature of caring. Given the resources available in the social insurance fund, we should examine this area.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that no one would take carer's leave on a casual basis. Even with the increases, the payment is just £96 per week, which is not a liveable amount today. This is something that is done when a person desperately needs time off to care for someone.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Minister may make regulations in respect of the form in which carer's leave may be taken by any specified class or classes of employees in circumstances where the carer's leave is to be taken in the form referred to in <i>subsection</i> (1)(b).&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new subsection was inserted on Committee Stage. Section 8 outlines the restrictions on the ways in which a period or periods of leave may be taken. Section 8(6), as an alternative to the provision in section (3)(5) of the Bill, as initiated, confers the power on the Minister to make regulations in relation to any specified class or classes of employee, setting out the manner in which car<Col N="578" /> er's leave may be taken in a form other than one continuous period of 65 weeks, that is, in the form specified in section (8)(1)(<i>b</i>). Following further consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel it was decided to redraft the section to make its intention clearer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is not rolling back. He deleted a section in the original Bill which seemed to allow him to specify circumstances in relation to a particular class or classes of employee. This is a simpler, clearer form but the Minister of State is not taking back what he gave.</P>
      <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
      <P>
        <i> Sitting suspended at 1.30 p.m. and resumed at 2.30 p.m.</i>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6 together.</P>
      <P>When I reported to the House on this matter on 4 April last, I indicated that the allocation of funds for the purchase of specific, core properties for MediaLabEurope and the wider Digital Hub projects would be agreed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then, consideration of development proposals submitted by Digital Media District Limited has been brought to a conclusion. On foot of this, the Government has agreed a capital allocation of up to £58 million by the end of next year <Col N="579" /> for the project. This is broken down between £39 million this year and £19 million next year for the purchase of core properties, including premises for MediaLabEurope. Current funding amounting to £2 million per annum has been approved for the operating expenses of Digital Media District Limited to end 2003. A total of £200,200 has been expended on the Digital Hub project to date and £14 million of the £28 million in start up capital allocated to the MediaLabEurope project has been spent to date, in line with the agreement between the Government and MediaLabEurope.</P>
    <P>On 4 April I also referred in the House to the involvement of the private sector in the development of certain aspects of the project and it has since been agreed that private sector investment will be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The board of DMD Limited has been requested to prepare a development strategy for the Digital Hub to the period ending December 2003. Work on legislation to place DMD Limited on a statutory footing has also been proceeding and the legislation will be brought before the Dáil as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As I said in the House on 14 February, a priority for DMD Limited in the start up phase is consultation with the local community. This remains a key priority for the Digital Hub team and it is being undertaken in the context of Dublin Corporation's integrated area plan for the Liberties-Coombe area. As part of the consultation process, a presentation was made by DMD Limited to local representatives at a meeting of the local area committee for south central Dublin, a sub-committee of Dublin City Council recently.</P>
    <P>Now that the preliminary stages of developing the project have been completed, responsibility for the Digital Hub &ndash; and MediaLabEurope &ndash; has been transferred to the Minister for Public Enterprise who will oversee its future development and introduce the legislation placing DMD Limited on a statutory footing. The Government made an order on Tuesday last transferring responsibility for DMD Limited to the Minister for Public Enterprise with effect from that date. The transfer process will also be dealt with in the context of the approval by the Dáil of the Revised Estimates for 2001.</P>
    <P>The current membership of the board of Digital Media District Limited which was approved by the Government in April 2000 is as follows: Paddy Teahon, executive chairperson; Dan Flinter, chief executive officer, Enterprise Ireland; Don Thornhill, chairman, Higher Education Authority; John Fitzgerald, Dublin City Manager; Paul Kavanagh, businessman; Paul McGuinness, Principle Management Limited; Peter Cassells, general secretary, Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Jackie Harrison, director of enterprise, IBEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Serious relevant information was withheld by the Government in relation to Campus Ireland and only came to light on foot of a <Col N="580" /> request under the Freedom of Information Act which showed that the estimate of the cost, as estimated by the Department of Finance, was significantly in excess of what was revealed to the House by the Minister of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Will the Taoiseach inform the House if there are similar conflicts with the Department of Finance, within Government or between Departments in respect of the projected cost of the Digital Media District project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance has been very much the driver of this project and it has been involved all the way. The money it has allocated to buy core properties is in addition to the £28 million that was given. The Department indicated the properties to be bought and where the investment is to be made. This is the first allocation it has given to the project, so it is very much one that has been cleared by it. The administration costs I gave in my reply are not large and they have also been cleared by the Department.</P>
      <P>The Department has also insisted that reviews of the project must be carried out in mid-2002 and at the end of 2003. The review to be carried out next year is to ensure the properties have been bought and the one to be carried out in 2003 is to examine some of the other plans for the Digital Hub to ascertain the stage they are at and how the private sector is faring in those areas. The company would probably hope that by that stage the private sector would have taken up some of the initiatives, but that remains to be seen. The company would probably also like if the State would assist if it was required to. Other than that, I do not think there are any other outstanding matters.</P>
      <P>MediaLabEurope is already up and running and the allocation of this money and the clearance of these issues will allow work on the wider Digital Hub to proceed and all concerned are anxious for that to go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach confirm that the executive chairman and the management services company appointed to oversee the Campus Ireland project are also the executive chairman and management services company appointed to this project? Will he inform the House of the precise remuneration arrangements put in place for Mr. Patrick Teahon, the executive chairman? Are we to take it that the consultancy fee arrangement for the Magahy company for this project is along the lines of that agreed for Campus Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the figure for Mr. Paddy Teahon, the figure of £200,200 is broken down between £183,200 for the executive service team and £17,000 to cover Mr. Teahon's salary and expenses up to December 2000. There is no overlap between the executive service team for Stadium Ireland and the Digital Hub apart from Magahy and Company who provided the <Col N="581" /> director of the executive service team. The business services, PriceWaterhouseCoopers and the other people in the consortium are different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the fees arrangement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was initially agreed on a month by month basis. The contract negotiations for the executive services team were conducted by Digital Media District Limited. The fee structure provided for payments on a fixed sum basis from November 2000 to March 2001, inclusive, and after that on the basis of a percentage of the development costs. The discussions on this with the Department have not concluded and are still evolving. That is mainly for two reasons, one, to ascertain the likely development costs, which have been only cleared by the Department of Finance and, two, to examine how precisely they would structure it. There is no agreement at this stage on how the fee will be structured. It may end up like Stadium Campus Ireland, but there is no agreement on that yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked what is the fixed fee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is not one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the £17,000 given to Mr. Patrick Teahon, was there also the question of the provision of a motor car?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not as far as I know. I do not have the terms of his contract. In the case of Stadium Campus Ireland, he is in receipt of an allowance which allows for a car, but I do not think it is linked to the Digital Media District project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a cross-over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is not. He is not part of the executive service team. His agreement is separate and I have no problem in making the terms of his contracts for both projects available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from what the Taoiseach has said that the legislation to put this body on a statutory footing will be drafted in the Department Enterprise, Trade and Employment, therefore, we will not see it for a couple of years given the Department's legislative work load.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be too much difficulty with the legislation. I believe it will be available this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is joking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we will have the legislation in this calendar year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="582" />
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach knows we will not have the legislation this year. The Minister of State is smiling because he knows exactly what he must do in the time available. We will not see the legislation for this body which has been allocated substantial amounts of capital and is effectively unaccountable in this House other than through the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment when she comes here. Given that the body will not be on a statutory footing, will the Taoiseach agree that because of the substantial sums of money being made available to the body, the company should come in here and be accountable to the Oireachtas through the relevant committee of this House? I presume the normal convention will prevail in respect of retired civil servants employed by the Government following their retirement whereby any salaries accumulated on foot of new employment contracts would be netted from their pension entitlements. While Mr. Teahon has given a great service to this country over many years of dedicated public service, is it correct that like all other public servants who have taken on additional assignments following retirement, the net value of his remuneration would be equivalent to his pension entitlements in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first question, the company has already reported to a Dáil committee and I have answered questions on the estimate figure. I have already made it clear that the company is answerable to a Dáil committee about which there is no difficulty.</P>
      <P>In regard to Mr. Teahon, I understand the rule is that taking into account pension and whatever other work one can get, a person is not entitled to receive more than he received when working, which applies in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, it is true that while the protocol is that a retired civil servant is not customarily entitled to earn more than he earned while working in the sum of payments plus pension, the reason a car allowance is being provided is to stay within that limit. By providing a car allowance, the Taoiseach is clearly in breach of the protocol to which he has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would need to look at the breakdown of the figures. However, as I understand it, the protocol is that taking the pension and what one earns by way of salary, one cannot receive more than one earned. I presume in relation to expenses, looking at the figure for last year &ndash; Mr. Teahon has worked on the project since 1999 &ndash; his full remuneration in monetary terms last year was £17,000. Obviously he is also in receipt of money for Stadium Campus Ireland, which I do not think creates a difficulty. There is no secret in regard to these details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the sum of pension, plus Campus Ireland, plus this project <Col N="583" /> would take Mr. Teahon to well in excess of the protocol to which the Taoiseach referred and that the arrangement was made to provide him with a car allowance rather than salary so that the Taoiseach could state here that he is within the protocol, when he is not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £17,000 was paid to Mr. Teahon for last year, which is inclusive of salary and expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Campus Ireland figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the Campus Ireland figure. However, I am prepared to make the figures available. If the figure was the same, including the pension, it would seem that between his pension, salary and expenses, he would still be on that figure. However, I have no difficulty making the figures available. I believe he still will not be over the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The original prediction was that approximately 7,000 jobs would be created in this area and approximately 2,500 new apartments built. Is the Taoiseach confident these numbers will materialise? Is he happy with the level of response by the local residents to the questionnaire circulated to them or does there need to be a more proactive consultation with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the jobs issue, I hope the figures will materialise. There is enormous interest in the area as a location for Internet, multimedia, information, communications and technologies industries. The Department of Finance believes many of the buildings the State could have bought should be bought by the private sector. Perhaps this is the case because the private sector has been active in the area. I understand relevant industries, not just developers, have an interest in the area. As MediaLabEurope, the flagship of the hub, moves on, in addition to anticipated private sector investment and refurbishment works, it certainly should help. To reach these figures will take time because it will depend on what types of industries come into the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the local residents are concerned, the corporation is involved in the redevelopment of the whole area. What is happening in relation to the Digital Hub will take place in conjunction with this redevelopment to try to ensure the corporation's plan for the Liberties-Coombe, together with the Rapid programme and the enormous amounts of money the corporation will spend to develop the area, will help to create a new model for urban regeneration and development. This will generate employment in the area and result in the provision of accommodation for residents and businesses. I understand contacts with representatives of the local community are continuing and there was a meeting last week. I believe the response to the questionnaires and <Col N="584" /> the contact with schools and other individuals in the community has been very helpful and that they have agreed a means of working together. Like the Financial Services Centre, one of the main priorities is to try to help the local residents in regard to education and relevant training. It is important that local residents get an opportunity to receive an education and have an opportunity to work in the industry. I have made my views in that regard very clear, as has the company. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has a great deal of experience in this area, is adamant it will play its part in achieving this goal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to education and training aspects, what third level colleges have been invited to participate or are currently actively engaged in the process? Will any of the institutes of technology, particularly the Dublin Institute of Technology, have any role to play?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Trinity College and other colleges will be involved. Dublin Institute of Technology is probably the most suitable because it is already close to the community and has helped in the development of the area. The Higher Education Authority and the enterprise and skills sections of the IDA are also involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the downturn in the US economy, particularly in the IT sector, is there concern that the scope of the project to attract research funds from American companies has been diminished? The possibility of such companies locating in the digital media district is also narrowing. Is it true that Mr. Paul Kavanagh, a member of the board, recently claimed credit for the project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that at the tribunal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Many have claimed credit but I hope their activity proves it to be correct because much of this is futuristic. For this reason it also seems to answer the first question. While the ICT companies may slow down this year it is felt that the work involved in this research will not suffer. It involves new aspects of work. It is extremely important to high tech industry that it develops these aspects. As most of the ICT companies are tightening their budgets and allocations this year there could be some short-term ups and downs but those who will drive this work are research graduates, scientists and others specialising in the area. The feeling is that the people involved will not be affected by short-term ups and downs because their work is for the longer term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach spoke about the need for consultation. In the early stages of the project some of the people from the south east inner city woke up to find they were living in the village quarter. There were signs all around indicating where this was and neither they nor the local authority had had any input. The Taoiseach mentioned the IFSC where the por<Col N="585" /> tents, given the fact that the locals seem to have been locked out of the place for many years, would not seem to be so good. Intense co-operation and consultation with the local authority and community are critical if the project is to be a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. I have first-hand experience of the time it took to develop those contacts in the International Financial Services Centre from which much can be learned. With young people in schools it took all of 14 years before it had an impact. I often wondered if I would ever see dealers and stockbrokers coming from the local community but two of the best and highest paid are locals. It has taken 14 years to reach this stage and it is now feeding down through the system. If a project is helped from primary school level it will not be long before people pass through the six years of second level and three or four years of third level, just a decade. There are many jobs along the ranks and it makes sense that people in the local community will, if given encouragement, have the chance to fill them. I have emphasised this from the start and from early on the board sent out flyers in the area and met the residents with whom it has co-operated closely. It has also met the public representatives, most recently last week. This is useful and as properties come on stream and are developed in the next few years there will be a real opportunity for people in the Liberties and Coombe area to become involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the last time that we will be able to ask the Taoiseach questions about this matter for which responsibility will now be vested, as we heard, in the Minister for Public Enterprise. Does the Taoiseach agree that the experience in the IFSC was that there was little or no engagement with local community groups because there was no legal mandate on the Custom House docklands development authority to actually engage on a structured basis? Bearing in mind that the area is located in his constituency, it was only when specific legislative obligations were written in that the development authority engaged in the kind of community support programmes with which his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Eoin Ryan, would be more than familiar. The Taoiseach referred to the heads of the Bill having been agreed. Do they make specific reference to the necessity of the company in question, which presumably will become a semi-State company, to have a legislative obligation to engage in community development with local people in addition to its other obligations in respect of research and development and the advancement of communications in the electronic sphere? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked me that question many months ago. At that stage I undertook to look at aspects of the Custom House <Col N="586" /> docklands development authority legislation to try to work out similar provisions as they have worked extremely well and played a big part in the Custom House dockslands development authority in the general area and training programme.

      <P>I understand it is. Some of the local Deputies asked me to meet some local groups. It was pointed out to me by people involved in the education area that much of the project involved science and technological subjects and academic studies. As a result employment opportunities would initially, perhaps for a decade, have to be found in other areas. I asked the draft team to look at this particularly. I have also asked that the draft take into account that they cannot just say they cannot find a scientist or technologist. They must take local involvement into account through some other employment. I can see how easy it would be to get out of a commitment. That is what happened in the early years of the International Financial Services Centre when excuses were found for employing anybody except a local.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> In replies to questions on 8 November 2000 and 14 February 2001 I summarised the main recommendations of the Nally report on the public prosecution system in relation to the Chief State Solicitor's office. These were the transfer of the criminal division of the Chief State Solicitor's office to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the transfer of the State solicitor services from the Attorney General to the DPP.</P>
    <P>Following long negotiations with the staff side on the additional staff resources and structures required under new organisational arrangements for the prosecution service, agreement was reached earlier this month. Arrangements are now in train to implement the terms of the agreement.</P>
    <P>One of the key factors in the transfer of the criminal division will be the provision of additional accommodation to cater for an enhanced staffing complement. Progress on the accommodation front has been made and it is now expected that the move to new premises will take place towards the end of this year. The formal transfer of responsibility to the solicitor to the DPP will take place in advance of the actual move.</P>
    <P>The transfer of responsibility for the State solicitor service is the subject of ongoing discussions between the Attorney General's office and the DPP.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of March, 40 staff vacancies existed within the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, including two at assistant chief State solicitor level, one at principal solicitor level and 13 at assistant solicitor level. What impact have these gaps on the delivery of the service? What steps are being taken by the Taoiseach to ensure the posts are filled at the earliest possible date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a number of competitions in recent years and I recently reported to the House that there had been a competition to try to fill the remaining posts, as a result of which the vacancies will be filled. The fulfilment of the new agreement will be a challenging task and I will outline some of its terms to the House. A publicity campaign to help recruit staff will be launched within the next few days by the offices concerned. As a result of the agreement reached two weeks ago, which will be effective from 1 April 2000, the staff complement will be increased by 75, including 66 professional and technical workers. Confined competitions for serving contract staff will allow those on contract employment to take up full-time employment. The staff side has accepted a competition system to fill promotional posts and will co-operate fully with the implementation of the Nally report, subject to negotiation and the acceptance and operation by staff of new work practices and procedures arising from the introduction of IT and IT-linked work management systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> Solicitors have engaged in long, drawn-out negotiations over the past two years to come to new agreements on grades. A new recruitment scale will replace the existing two lower grades. Newly qualified solicitors with a degree will start with a salary of just under £24,000 and will progress to just over £40,000 within six years. Fifty-two extra professional staff will be appointed, representing an increase of 56% and 12 extra posts will be created at principal solicitor level and above. There will be recruitment for technical posts such as legal clerk, which will be a higher grade than law clerk, a grade where recruitment was difficult. The appointment of 14 extra technical staff will mean a 31% increase over existing levels. There will be nine extra senior technical posts and the current grades of legal clerk, senior legal clerk and legal staff officer will be replaced by two new grades, staff officer and higher executive officer. There will be new opportunities and support for technical staff to qualify as solicitors.</P>
    <P>There will be a campaign to recruit additional staff during the coming months and probably for the remainder of the year. The necessary regrading and the implementation of the Nally report will be carried out at the same time. One of the main recommendations of the Nally report was that when the criminal division was switched from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor to that of the Director of Public Prosecutions, a new post of solicitor to the DPP would be created. That person is in place, has been part of negotiations and is involved in arranging new structures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is probably aware of media speculation that it may not be possible to introduce the long-awaited penalty points system for driving offences for at least another 12 months as a result of computer system deficiencies. Next weekend has been designated as national road safety awareness weekend. Will the Taoiseach firmly indicate when this system will be introduced and when computers will be upgraded to facilitate it?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="589" /> The Government intends to continue having meetings outside Dublin from time to time. The policy was introduced last year and meetings have been held in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon, Knocknaheeney, County Cork, Faithlegg, County Waterford, Ballymascanlon, County Louth, and most recently in Muckross, County Kerry, two days ago. The public interest justifies the organisational effort behind the initiative and I intend that visits to other regional locations will continue from time to time, although no further meetings are planned at this stage. The costs arising to my Department from the meeting in Ballymascanlon have yet to be calculated, but will be about £3,500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the project has not yet been successful? The meeting in Ballymascanlon was flagged as the beginning of progress in solving the health crisis. Now that the Government is facing its fifth year in office and the Minister for Health and Children has put 50 health service reviews in place, does the Taoiseach agree it is time to address the crisis in a realistic manner rather than merely taking the Cabinet on a tour of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Noonan. We cannot hold Cabinet meetings in provincial locations every week or every month, but it is useful to do so when there are particular reasons, as there were in the case of Ballymascanlon. The people of that area were cut off from the rest of the country for three months and were enormously inconvenienced on behalf of the rest of us. The local community agreed that a Government meeting in their area would be an appropriate way of showing recognition. Killarney is the capital of the tourism industry and the efforts of the people to revitalise a difficult tourist season, after the crucial marketing month of March was lost, were recognised. The purpose of bringing meetings to these areas was to applaud the efforts of the people.</P>
      <P>There will always be controversy regardless of the agenda of a Cabinet meeting, but the location of the meeting is irrelevant to what took place. Ballaghaderreen and Faithlegg were chosen as locations for Cabinet meetings as the headquarters of the BMW and southern and eastern regions are located there. It is good to have meetings in the regions as everything does not begin and end in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the Taoiseach's comments, in so far as they went. The Taoiseach has effectively confirmed that both meetings were public relations affairs, for justifiable reasons. Will he explain what happened in Ballymascanlon, including the fiasco that followed between the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly is. I do not think the locations chosen for the meetings were exercises in public relations, as we attempted to give recognition to a community and the work done by its people. It is good for the democratic system to be seen to have more of a human face than when it is hidden in Government Buildings and nobody knows when the Government meets. There is no harm in going to such areas to meet people who give their time to organisations and try to work in communities like Knocknaheeney, Faithlegg and the other places I mentioned. Deputies who are members of regional committees and groups are given an opportunity to raise issues with the Cabinet when it meets in their area, which is a good thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Government wanted to go to the Cooley peninsula to sympathise with the community there that had been isolated as a result of foot and mouth disease. It was an unfortunate location, however, in which to stick a knife into the back of the Minister for Health and Children. He had been set up to make a grandiose announcement, only to have the Minister for Finance slap him down, a response the Taoiseach must have expected. Was it deliberate, accidental, or as a result of indifference that the Government meeting in Killarney to celebrate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's birthday clashed with an important meeting of the Council of Ministers responsible for justice? Will the Taoiseach explain why Ireland was not represented by a Minister at the European meeting? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure our ambassador represented us on the day. I assure the Deputy that it was a coincidence that the Cabinet meeting took place on the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue's birthday. Ministers attend Cabinet meetings in most circumstances unless they believe it is impossible to do so. It is obvious, therefore, that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had no difficulty with being represented by somebody else. He had a number of matters to bring to the Cabinet meeting so he had to attend, regardless of where it was held.</P>

      <P>The Killarney meeting was flagged with much briefing from Government sources. Apart from photo calls, all that seems to have happened is that an additional £2 million was provided for marketing the tourism industry. That was nothing new as it had been flagged on a number of occasions previously. Was any other relevant decision taken in respect of this hard-pressed industry, which is probably facing losses of £0.5 billion due to foot and mouth disease? Has the Government ruled out any element of compensation by way of tax relief or otherwise for the tourism industry which has suffered so much and has seen the cancellation of bookings for the remainder of the season?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has outlined several initiatives in which he is directly involved, with Revenue and local authorities, to lighten the burden on the tourism industry. The additional money announced the other day was in response to a request from the Tourist Industry Federation for an additional marketing programme to run into the autumn. This required another £2 million on top of the £5 million which was given a few weeks ago and was additional to the original £57 million.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest official data on construction and demolition waste recovery is contained in the National Waste Database Report for 1998, published by the Environmental Protection Agency. This report indicates that more than 2.7 million tonnes of construction and demolition waste was sent to landfill in 1998, of which almost 1.2 million tonnes or 43% was recovered and used for construction purposes or as landfill cover.</P>
      <P>The 1998 policy statement on waste management, Changing our Ways, which has as its main aim a radical reduction in national reliance on landfill, recognised that the construction industry has the primary responsibility to ensure the environmentally sound management of construction and demolition waste. In it, the industry was challenged to treat waste as a resource and to take practical steps to achieve the recycling of at least 50% of such waste within five years and at least 85% over a 15 year period. The industry was invited to devise and implement a coherent programme of voluntary measures, involving effective least-cost solutions, to meet these national targets.</P>
      <P>In response to the targets set in Changing our Ways, a dedicated task force was established by the forum for the construction industry to co-ordinate the development of a voluntary industry-wide programme to meet the proposed recovery targets. I understand the task force has concluded its deliberations and I expect to receive substantive proposals for an action programme, involving a comprehensive matrix of measures and incorporating an implementation timetable, very shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that about 30% of the waste that goes to landfill constitutes construction and demolition waste. It is, therefore, a very valuable resource and much could be done with it. Will the Minister give details of the audits he proposes to implement of actual waste production because it is a grey area? We are not sure how much waste is produced and how much is disposed to landfill. Will he also outline the meetings he has had with the construction industry with a view to developing methods of recycling this waste?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We outlined what we wanted the construction industry to do as part of the implementation of our national waste management policy, Changing our Ways. The industry set up a task force to examine ways and means of dealing with construction and demolition waste in a cost effective manner by trying to recover as much of it as possible for use as a resource. Currently about 43% of it is recovered and used for construction purposes or as landfill cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> The task force has been meeting and is now in a position to let me have a final report. I understand this will make a number of recommendations, including auditing of waste, ensuring a cessation of the use of unauthorised operators including carriers for the management of construction and demolition waste, developing codes of best practice, identifying and initiating flagship demonstration projects that would maximise the recycling of construction and demolition waste, and ensuring formal mechanisms for the recording and reporting of such waste so that we will know what is generated and where it is going. I have also asked for proposals on developing a network of construction and demolition waste recycling facilities, developing markets for recycled construction and demolition waste, providing incentives for that to happen and initiating a national awareness campaign on the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has outlined a number of measures. Has the task force considered the possibility of making it a condition of a planning permission for projects over a certain size that the waste generated should be recycled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be done if a local authority so desires. I am not sure whether it is addressed specifically in the report. I am giving a general indication from earlier discussions I have had as to what might or might not be in the report. Local authorities can impose various conditions. If we go down the road of trying to recover as much construction and demolition waste as we would like and of trying to reach the target of 85% recovery within the 15 year period, action along the lines suggested by the Deputy would have to be part of that.</P>

House completions for the first four months of this year show an increase of 4.2% over the same period in 2000, which was the sixth year of record housing output. We have been building houses at by far the highest rate in Europe in relation to population and after six consecutive years of record output I expect a continued high level of output this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> While local authority housing output last year was disappointing, at about the same level as in 1997, it has to be borne in mind that 2000 was the first year of a four year multi-annual programme designed to deliver 25,000 local authority housing starts. At the end of last year there were over 5,000 houses under construction, which is the highest level since 1985. Moreover, I expect that local authorities will start over 7,000 houses this year.</P>

      <P>Is he now following the same logic by denying what everybody in the construction industry knows to be the case, that house construction is down this year? The Minister's policy of increasing supply is in tatters. The number of local authority houses built last year was the lowest for eight years, despite the fact that the number of people on the housing list has doubled. Is the Minister in charge of this area of policy or is he in denial? Why does he not accept that his policies are simply not working and will have to be changed? Does he have new proposals or initiatives to deal with the housing crisis he has presided over for the past four years?</P>

      <P>Meeting housing need is a huge challenge and I have always said that. If the Deputy wishes to call it a crisis, it does not matter to me. I am conscious of the need and demand for housing. We have had to deal with many difficulties, including exorbitant increases in house prices, but we have taken measures which have been successful in calming things down in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While completions for the first four months of this year are up 4.2% on the same period last year, it is too early to make predictions about expected housing output. Claims of a 17% fall in private housing output are exaggerated. Comparison of HomeBond registrations in the year 2001 with the year 2000, when registrations were exceptionally high because of a change in HomeBond procedures, are misleading. While HomeBond registrations are down 17% in the first four <Col N="595" /> months of 2001 compared to the 2000 figures, the decrease on the 1999 figure is significantly less at 6.4%.</P>
    <P>While there might be some reduction in private housing output this year, there will be an increase in local authority and voluntary housing output. Local authority house building, excluding acquisitions, should be approximately 4,000 compared with 2,200 last year. Voluntary housing output should increase from 951 units last year to over 1,200 this year. The official figures for local authority housing completions in 2000, which the Deputy claims to be the lowest in eight years, is 3,207. The figure for 1997 was 3,217. I do not understand what the Deputy is seeking to compare.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is getting into the semantics of whether the house is built by the local authority or on a PPP basis. What is important is the number of new houses being provided to enable people on the housing lists to be housed. We are putting much emphasis on encouraging PPP arrangements between the local authorities and local contractors to try to accelerate the programme. Is Deputy Gilmore opposed to our actions in providing increased funding and seeking quicker ways of achieving the construction of houses for people on the waiting lists? That is what he appears to imply.</P>

      <P>There was a small glimmer of accuracy in part of the Minister's reply. He acknowledged that the level of private house construction is down this year. By what amount is the number of private houses under construction down this year on last year? Will he acknowledge that the number of houses being built is down, despite all the times he said over recent years that his wish was to increase supply and that the thrust of Government housing policy was to increase construction? That has failed and the figures prove it, and no amount of juggling of the percentages by the Minister will disguise that fact.</P>

      <Quest>if he has given consideration to the revision of the strategic planning guidelines for Dublin in favour solely of consolidating the metropolitan area which is clearly not being achieved.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, which were published on 25 March 1999, set out an integrated land use and transportation framework for the sustainable development of the greater Dublin area, comprising the Dublin and mid-east regions. The guidelines set out separate development strategies for the metropolitan area and the hinterland area, as defined in the guidelines.</P>
      <P>In relation to the metropolitan area, that is, the existing built up area of Dublin and its immediate environs, the guidelines propose that the area should be consolidated in line with the principles of sustainable development. The guidelines indicate that the consolidation of the metropolitan area will allow it to accommodate a greater population than at present.</P>
      <P>The question as to whether any change should be made to the strategic planning guidelines is primarily one for the Dublin and mid-east regional authorities. However, given that land use trends by their nature take some time to alter, it would seem premature at this stage to require the guidelines to be reviewed. In any event, I anticipate the guidelines will need to be reviewed when the national spatial strategy is published towards the end of this year and there would be no point in engaging in a separate exercise at this stage.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister familiar with the expression &ldquo;cappuccino cowboys&ldquo;? It is used to describe the American phenomenon of urban dwellers seeking to live in rural settings. Will he accept that he is presiding over our version of &ldquo;cappuccino cowboys&rdquo; where families are forced to move from where their housing needs are in Dublin or other urban settings to live in other areas? How can the Minister say he is happy with the guidelines? Clearly, they are not being adhered to and are vague. As far as the hinterland of Dublin is concerned, it is not clear what is intended by the guidelines. Even if they were clear and were being complied with, they are producing catastrophic settlement results. Families are being forced not just to the outer regions of the counties around Dublin but up to 70 and 80 miles away. That is an irreversible trend. How can the Minister stand over this and lecture local authorities on what should happen when he is responsible for what is happening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am flattered the Deputy thinks I could be single-handedly responsible for so much. The strategic planning guidelines were published on 25 March 1999 and put in place shortly afterwards. It is a little early to claim the guidelines, which were put in place to counteract <Col N="597" /> the effects of what was happening in the greater Dublin area at the time, are to blame for what is happening. The guidelines are designed to reverse or slow down what is happening, but to expect them to do that within 18 months of being put in place is unrealistic.</P>
      <P>Regarding the point about the strategic planning guidelines not being complied with, if local authorities do not comply with those guidelines, now that the Planning and Development Act, 2000, is in place they must have regard to those guidelines. In a number of instances where local authorities appeared not to be in compliance with the strategic planning guidelines, because of the powers vested in me by the Planning and Development Act, 2000, I have been in a position to write to tell them I felt they were not in compliance with the strategic planning guidelines and to ask them to revise their development plans. Therefore, there is such a power which never existed previously. Certainly no power was used previously.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is being very unfair in blaming the strategic planning guidelines which were put in place to solve the problem she is highlighting. Given time, in the context of the national spatial strategy we will certainly be in a position to reverse some, but not all, of the trends which have emerged over the past four or five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the aspirations of the guidelines were highly desirable but what I am pointing out to the Minister is that the evidence of our own eyes shows, and all the best planning advice is, that the guidelines are now being interpreted in a way which is locating Dublin families too far away from Dublin for a sustainable way of life and yet too near to Dublin to avoid the drag of Dublin. Would the Minister not accept that all the advice now is to revise those plans and at least bring clarity to them? Simply writing to local authorities and asking them for explanations will not change settlement strategies. He has a very short time in which to do so because the house buying population bulge has about five years to run. If he does not move now, it will be too late.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government recognises the need for a thriving, diverse and well managed private rented sector. Government policy seeks to promote investment in the supply of accommodation on the basis of long-term commitment to <Col N="598" /> the sector and to discourage speculative investment, which serves only to drive up house prices and fuel rent increases. Recommendations for improvements to the sector, including measures to increase supply, were made by the commission on the private rented residential sector. The Government's response to these proposals, which was announced in January 2001, forms the basis for the reform of the sector and includes, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment of a private residential tenancies board for facilitating speedy dispute resolution, the introduction of legislation to improve security of tenure as well as taxation incentives to encourage increased supply. Some of these taxation proposals have already been implemented in this year's Finance Act.</P>
      <P>In addition to these measures aimed specifically at the private rented sector, a wide range of measures has been implemented by Government to maximise the supply of housing. Changes were recently made to investor stamp duty rates so that the owner occupier rates now apply in respect of new houses, with the 3% rate applying to properties up to £150,000 rather than the 9% rate which previously applied. This should assist in encouraging investment in the sector and increasing the supply of accommodation.</P>
      <P>Section 50 of the Finance Act, 1999, provides an incentive to increasing the supply of purpose built student accommodation. I understand that returns received recently by the Department of Education and Science indicate that some 2,260 bed spaces have been certified by third level colleges under section 50 and a further 14,000 are at various stages of planning.</P>
      <P>This Government has also improved the position of tenants in the private rented residential sector by twice increasing the ceilings for income tax relief. The ceiling in respect of rent paid by tenants under 55 was doubled. In the case of tenants over 55 a doubling of the ceiling, coupled with standard rating of the relief, means that 80% of such tenants gain a doubling of relief. A rent a room scheme was announced in the 2001 budget which provides for an exemption from income tax in respect of gross rental income of up to £6,000 per annum, for accommodation provided in a person's principal private residence. This measure will facilitate the provision of accommodation thereby easing the pressure on the private rented sector and will also improve the utilisation of the housing stock.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State accept that housing outputs are down but the output of apartment accommodation for rent has simply disappeared altogether, and that it is entirely due to his policy of withdrawing interest relief? Has he any idea of the misery it is causing right throughout the market as it is forcing people out at the bottom end of the market? They are the people who are suffering most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand targeting speculators but his measure hit the investor, not the speculator. Either he wants a private rented sector or he does <Col N="599" /> not. All the evidence shows that there will not be a private rented sector unless there are changes in this law. Is the Minister of State in charge of this or is the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, setting the agenda?

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Mortgage interest relief for investors, which the Deputy has raised here, was abolished in action on housing prices following recommendations in the first Bacon report as it was considered it was a serious contributory factor to overheating and distortion in the housing market and the exclusion of many first time buyers. Removal of interest deductibility has helped reduce the increase in house prices and increase the proportion of housing going to first time purchasers. It would be undesirable to reintroduce mortgage interest relief for investors on a general basis, if that is what the Deputy is suggesting, as it was a preferential tax treatment of investors over owner occupiers as mortgage interest relief for the individual is capped. It led to increasing speculative demand in a market where there was an existing shortfall between supply and demand.</P>
      <P>The other tax relief, which the Deputy did not mention, was section 23 relief. The commission on the private rented residential sector did recommend that section 23 relief should apply for a limited period to the provision of rented accommodation to target groups identified as having priority needs having regard to local authority housing strategies. The Government agreed to this recommendation and it is being considered having regard to the overall balance of supply and demand within the housing market and the necessity of avoiding undesirable house price increases or the displacement of first time purchasers.</P>

      <P>If the Minister of State will not accept the social arguments of the need for a private rented sector, would he accept the economic argument? If there is to be a flexible labour force, then it is absolutely essential that there is a flexible housing market in order that people, who come here even for a few months or a year, would not have to buy a house in order to get accommodation. As institutions invest in every other kind of property, why would they not invest in private rented accommodation which could then be managed by corporations or by the voluntary associations? Would the Minister of State agree that if there is ever to be a professional quality well regulated private rented sector which perhaps would attract institutions, we must put it on a proper business footing with the same reliefs which are available to every other business? They should not receive special treatment, just the same treatment.</P>

      <P>Government policy on waste management is committed to a major reduction in our reliance on landfill and the implementation of an integrated waste management approach which will provide the improved infrastructure, waste services and other supporting structural measures necessary to deliver our ambitious national recovery and recycling targets over a 15 year period. Proposed regional and local waste management plans incorporate proposals for a range of recycling and recovery facilities.</P>
      <P>Changing our Ways places a strong emphasis on the need to give effect to the polluter pays principle in financing the provision of waste services by or on behalf of local authorities, including segregated waste collection and recycling initiatives. Within each region, it is essential that local authorities move rapidly towards full cost recoupment for the waste services that they provide, by means of use related waste charges levied on all waste producers, including households and commercial/business concerns.</P>
      <P>Within the overall context of the £650 million investment in waste services earmarked under the NDP, £100 million in Exchequer/EU assistance will be used primarily to support the capital cost of waste collection and recycling facilities which are either provided for in, or are otherwise considered to support the objectives of, regional and local waste management plans. Details of this grants scheme are being finalised and will be published shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, local authorities and other State <Col N="601" /> agencies, for example, Enterprise Ireland, already support appropriate recycling initiatives.</P>
    <P>Further support measures will be facilitated by the proposed environment fund, which is provided for in the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001. This Bill also provides for the introduction of a landfill levy, which among other things is intended to offset differentials between the cost of waste disposal and recycling and so give an incentive to divert waste from landfill. Income from the landfill levy will be disbursed through the environment fund.</P>
    <P>The development and implementation of producer responsibility initiatives by relevant industry sectors will increasingly lead to the provision of financial and other supports for relevant waste recycling initiatives. For example, the Repak payment subsidy scheme, under which Repak makes a payment to private waste contractors for every tonne of packaging waste it collects and sends for recycling, is intended to provide stability to Irish packaging waste markets; in turn this encourages waste operators to upgrade their operations through investment in staff and equipment.</P>
    <P>Other producer responsibility initiatives are being developed for construction and demolition waste, end of life vehicles and tyres, or are planned, for example, for electrical and electronic wastes.</P>
    <P>I will further address the question of financial supports for the development of recycling and reprocessing activities in the forthcoming policy statement on waste prevention and recovery. However, I am not minded to propose operational subsidies from Government for commercial recycling activities. Ongoing subvention of this nature will not address structural deficiencies impeding the recycling industry or overcome underlying obstacles to better recycling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The scale of our economy is so small that it is not possible for people to engage in recycling. I know of a number of individuals and enterprises who attempted to do it but it was not financially viable. There needs to be State assistance. Grants are available for many other activities in sectors such as farming and house building, to help businesses operate on a profitable basis. More recycling would result in less expenditure on waste collection. The Minister gave me a glimmer of hope when he said some moneys were being provided for waste disposal and recycling. Is the Minister indicating there will be grants available for recycling enterprises? That is one of the ways to attack the waste disposal problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that because of demographics, the scale of the country and the manner in which waste management has been operated up to now, it has been difficult for people to make a successful business out of recycling activities. That is why we chose the route for changing our ways, to encourage local authorities to operate on a regional rather than <Col N="602" /> on a local basis, in order to bring some critical mass into particular regions to deal with waste. The Deputy is correct, I said that there is a £650 million investment programme in waste services earmarked under the national development plan. There will be £100 million in Exchequer and EU assistance, primarily to support the capital costs of the waste collection and recycling facilities. I emphasise that it is to support the capital costs.</P>
      <P>Direct subventions, apart from the problems that we would have from the point of view of the EU, competition and State aid, are not the most efficient and effective way of encouraging waste management and the provision of waste management facilities. The recycling policy document will outline the proposed assistance. The underlying premise of the Deputy's question is that it has not been possible and there have not been successful recycling operations in this country. My counterpart in Northern Ireland, Mr. Sam Foster, and I recently launched the Recycling Directory of Ireland. It lists successful reprocessors and recycling enterprises throughout the island of Ireland. A whole range of goods have been successfully recovered &ndash; paper, glass, card, plastics, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, oils, computer and electrical waste, biodegradable waste, batteries, timber, textiles.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>The safety record of bus transport in Ireland generally compares favourably with that for other transport modes. However, it is now appropriate to address improvement of road safety standards for buses in view of (a) the development of recent EU legislation in this area, and (b) the stated commitment of the Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002, to bring forward proposals for consultation on enhancing school bus safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now open to EU member states to require the fitting of seat belts in new buses. In practice, and even in advance of this position, most new <Col N="603" /> buses and coaches, including those entering the Irish market, are now equipped with seat belts.</P>
    <P>However, the application of a mandatory national requirement for seat belts in new buses has also to be considered in light of a number of other factors. These include: the need to continue accommodating standing passengers and frequent stop services on urban bus routes, avoidance of an incentive to import older bus vehicles so as to escape compliance with stricter standards for new vehicles, the question of retrospective application of seat belt standards to the existing bus fleet, and the implications for the present 3 for 2 concession applying in Ireland and many other countries for school transport.</P>
    <P>I intend that the consultation paper on school bus safety, to be published this summer, will address these issues and that following the public consultation, a position on this general question will be decided by the Government and introduced into regulations by the end of 2001.</P>

I ask the Minister to confirm in his reply that it is a legislative issue.</P>
      <P>School buses are a particular interest of mine. At this time of year, many children are travelling on school tours and are being transported to extra-curricular activities. There are mandatory seat belts in cars and we all recognise the importance of seat belts, yet we are prepared to turn a blind eye to children travelling in buses all over the country without the benefit of seat belts. This is a safety issue and the provision of seat belts in buses should be mandatory. Will the Minister clarify if it is possible for seat belts to be fitted in existing older buses?</P>

The question of the 3 for 2 arrangement in school buses, three children occupying a seat to fit two adults, is being examined. The fitting of seat belts will be examined in the study. We will be in a position to make decisions and introduce regulations well before the end of the year, if that is the Government decision.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that he intends to publish a consultation paper and make regulations before the end of the year. Is it the Minister's general view that there may be a distinction drawn between buses in urban areas which stop frequently and where standing passengers are allowed, and school buses and coaches that operate on longer journeys outside of urban areas? Has the Minister had discussions with bus operators in advance of the publication of the consultation paper, and will he indicate what is the general view of the bus operators of a regime which would require the provision of seat belts on buses?</P>

      <P>I already informed the House that work is under way on the preparation of a consultation paper. This will be followed by public consultation prior to the Government making any decisions. I am not in a position to outline my own views or those of the Department until we see the outcome of the consultation process.</P>
      <P>I checked out the international position on seat belts and, based on its accident research analysis, Transport Canada has determined that seat belts may actually adversely affect the safety of children on school buses and, therefore, has no plans to make them mandatory. With the notable exception of the UK, seat belts are mandatory in very few countries.</P>
      <P>This issue is being considered in the wider European as well as a national context. We await the outcome of consultations with the relevant parties here, particularly Bus Éireann which may have gained knowledge in this area from transport companies in other countries. All of this knowledge will be considered prior to the publication of the consultation paper.</P>

      <Quest>if local authorities throughout the country must provide transient halting sites to a group of Travellers whose members are extensively traders and who enter the jurisdiction at various times in the year to gain local employment; his views in relation to a number of unauthorised encampments in the Dublin area where in excess of 100 caravans have destroyed public open space; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, requires local authorities, in carrying out the statutory assessment of needs under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, to include a separate assessment of the need for caravan sites for Travellers. The assessment must include the assessment of need for sites with limited facilities, normally referred to as transient sites, to take account of the annual pattern of movement of Travellers, other than their normal place of residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1998 Act, each local authority is <Col N="605" /> required to have regard to the need for transient sites as identified in its assessment of need in preparing its Traveller accommodation programme. No distinction is made between categories of Traveller, such as traders, who may avail of the use of transient sites provided by local authorities. However, guidelines issued by my Department to local authorities on the provision of transient sites recommended that generally such sites should not be designed to cater for more than 20 bays. There is a range of powers available to local authorities and the Garda Síochána to deal with unauthorised encampments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister admitting that there is a law in place under which every local authority is expected to provide an infinite number of transient halting sites to a group of people whose members are, in the main, traders who can provide accommodation of their own or who have alternative accommodation in other counties? Does the Minister accept there is a need to change the law in respect of trespass? A situation arose in my constituency where 120 traders moved into an area and caused £60,000 damage as a result of leaving 200 tonnes of rubbish on a public open space. The Minister expects the relevant local authority to foot the bill for this. Does the Minister accept that the handling of transient, Traveller traders threatens the entire success of the Traveller accommodation programme?</P>

      <P>I introduced the Traveller accommodation legislation and the local authorities have drawn up and adopted their accommodation plans. It is time now to implement these proposals. The accommodation proposals require the provision of transient sites. If local authorities in Dublin had been active in implementing these proposals and if the transient sites were in place, this type of difficulty would not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of transient sites gives rise to difficulties. This is not a new problem although it may be new to Deputy Hayes or to Dublin. People throughout the country experience this problem in spring and summer every year. Local authorities which have taken action on this issue no longer experience difficulties to the same extent as heretofore. The Traveller community in this country has been neglected and there is no easy solution to the problem of accommodation pro<Col N="606" /> vision. We have had a Supreme Court decision on what one can and cannot do where facilities are not provided&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is neither acceptable nor reasonable that a group of 60 or so Travellers would arrive in a particular area with the expectation that transient sites would be made available for them. That is not provided for in the guidelines issued to local authorities in which the Department indicated that the maximum site size should be 20 bays. Deputy Mitchell appears to be of the <Col N="607" /> opinion that because permanent halting sites are provided for Traveller families, they should not be allowed to move from them. The whole idea of halting sites was that Travellers would be able to keep their caravans on the halting sites and move during the summer. If official sites are not provided for Travellers when they are on the move, difficulties will arise. A large group of 50 or 60 at one time is exceptional.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 94 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>The national development plan sets out a strategic framework for the development of economic and social infrastructure over the period 2000 to 2006 and provides for a total investment of approximately £24 billion, current prices, for such development. The national development plan has been further elaborated in the economic and social infrastructure operational programme and in the operational programmes for the Border, midlands and western and the southern and eastern regions. Of the total planned investment, approximately £19 billion is for infrastructure programmes coming within the remit of my Department, including &ndash; national roads £5.4 billion; non-national roads £1.9 billion; water and waste water £3.5 billion; housing £7.2 billion; waste management; £0.65 billion; urban and village development £0.13 billion.</P>
      <P>Work is now well under way in my Department, local authorities and the National Roads Authority on the detailed programming of the work required and in the planning, design and implementation of individual infrastructure projects. Expenditure on these programmes in 2000 amounted to £1.75 billion, which is in line with NDP targets.</P>
      <P>Total EU funding for infrastructure, including projects under the remit of my Department and others, over the period 2000-2006 is £1.47 billion or 6% of the total planned investment. I am satisfied that all EU funding will be fully drawn down over the plan period.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the infrastructure investment programmes provided for in the NDP and its associated operational programmes is being actively pursued at all levels with a view to the timely completion of all NDP programmes. Implementation will be subject to full mid-term review in 2003 and is being closely monitored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is being made to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of improved infrastructure throughout the country. As part of the <Col N="610" /> effort, a broad-ranging package of measures is being pursued under the direction of the Cabinet committee on infrastructure development to support the process of implementation. These include the promotion of public private partnerships, new procedures for improved management of projects, improved arrangements for dealing with archaeological requirements, a communications strategy to gain maximum support for the NDP programmes, measures to increase the capacity of the construction industry, and the transfer of certain project approval functions to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied a good start has been made on the implementation of the NDP infrastructure programmes and that progress will continue towards achieving the ambitious objectives set out in the national development plan.</P>

Is he also suggesting that the success to date in getting through the preliminaries, prior to carrying out the works, is vastly in arrears in terms of time and meeting the schedule? Given that most of what he has done and said on the programme is purely propaganda and that there is little hope of delivery all he is hoping to do is to wait until after the next general election to explain why he did not deliver on time.</P>

      <P>One of the explanations suggested by the CIF and others is that the local authorities which are responsible for much of the spending are not geared up for it. They lack the skills, experience and project management teams to deliver these projects on such a scale. Has the Minister considered giving them the resources to do this work? It would be similar to the way in which the Taoiseach's projects such as Campus Ireland and the digital media district have been given project management teams.</P>

      <P>Part of the consideration of the delivery of the national development plan was to ensure agencies such as the National Roads Authority and the local authorities were given sufficient funding to enable them to deliver. This will be used to streamline processes and put in place new management techniques, new systems of project management. All this has been and will continue to be done. Local authorities are now receiving approximately £200 million more in discretionary funding than in 1997. The National Roads Authority, An Bord Pleanála and local authorities have been given increased staff. There are project management teams in the local authorities throughout the country to try to ensure projects are delivered. In some cases methods of delivery and consideration of major contracts have been streamlined. A whole range of measures have been put in place. A Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure meets on a regular basis. All projects across all Departments are regularly reviewed where they are not under direct departmental control. For example, the NRA, CIE etc. are asked to account for their <Col N="612" /> stewardship and any difficulties or roadblocks are discussed and solutions to problems found.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that the national development plan is ambitious and I am glad that he is optimistic that it will be delivered by 2006. The costings were based on 1999 prices. We are now in 2001 and final completion will be in 2006 with a mid-term review in 2003. I understand the inflation rate in construction is about 12.5% to 13%. What impact will this have on the NDP? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that the construction inflation rate is about 12.5%. This could have major implications for the timely and cost effective delivery of the infrastructure development programme which measures are being taken to facilitate. The prices quoted have always been 1999 prices. Anyone familiar with the system of financing multi-annual Government programmes is aware that an annual multiplier for inflation is taken into account.</P>
      <P>We have also looked at what is causing the increase in inflation. One of the major causes is the lack of capacity in the construction industry. Measures are being taken to facilitate its expansion through the greater use of PPPs and the attraction of foreign contractors. For example, the Waterford bypass and Kilcock-Kinnegad projects attracted interest from a significant number of foreign contractors. We would like to try to control cost inflation for which there is a certain amount allowed within projections.</P>

Based on construction cost increases in the past five years, particularly in the housing area, and comparing these with the programme he has set out, he will only be able to achieve half of the works involved. He has told the House that he realistically aspires to complete the programme but is he really serious when he asks the House to believe this?

    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;(6) The Minister may make regulations in respect of the form in which carer's leave may be taken by any specified class or classes of employees in circumstances where the car<Col N="614" /> er's leave is to be taken in the form referred to in <i>subsection (1)(b)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I was expressing concern that we seemed to be rowing back on the famous section 5 in the original Bill where the Minister after consultation with another Minister could issue regulations to exempt some provisions in relation to certain classes. The Government amendment allows the Minister to make regulations in respect of the form in which leave may be taken by any specified class or classes, where the application for carer's leave has been made and is proposed to be taken in a number of periods, the aggregate duration of which does not exceed 65 weeks from date of commencement. I am concerned at the inclusion of the phrase, &ldquo;any specified class or classes of employees&rdquo;. As I stressed in the earlier part of the debate, the key role of caring in society must be recognised.</P>
      <P>I accept the statement by the Minister of State earlier that the Bill is another step in that direction, perhaps a historic step. All workers should have equal entitlement to the 65 weeks, provided they meet the specified criteria under section 6. Why do we need the phrase &ldquo;by any specified class or classes of employees&rdquo;? Are we reverting to the former situation where, in effect, the Government was prepared to ensure that certain sectors of the workforce would not be able to avail of this? Members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána, who collectively number more than 20,000, should not have their right to act as family carers impeded. I ask the Minister of State to clarify this issue and to indicate that he is not seeking to put a barrier to the equal rights of all classes of workers, whether in the public or private sectors, to avail of carer's leave and benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The section was redrafted in the interest of greater clarity of intention. Section 8(6) is an alternative to the provision in section 3(5) of the Bill as initiated. It enables the Minister to make regulations in relation to any specified class or classes of employees, setting out the manner in which carer's leave may be taken in a form other than one continuous period of 65 weeks, as is specified in section 8(1)(b). Deputy Broughan referred to people such as teachers. It could be open to management and teacher representatives to agree specific arrangements for the implementation of the legislation in so far as it affects teachers. The Department of Education and Science has said that there is no objection to granting carer's leave for teachers. That Department acknowledges that the exclusion of teachers from such a scheme would be discriminatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has to be a clear structure for dealing with those situations. The working year for teachers is atypical. Difficulties which would arise <Col N="615" /> in relation to the employment of suitably qualified personnel to replace teachers while on carer's leave might well necessitate special conditions in the interests of the teachers themselves and of school managements, students and parents. This amendment is simply tidying up what we had put in place earlier. It is not unusual in legislation to allow for the Minister to make regulations in respect of particular categories. I reiterate that the Government and the Department of Education and Science, which has the lead role in this regard, are conscious of the need to ensure there will be no discrimination against teachers. This is a normal provision in relation to particular categories of workers, not necessarily teachers alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State accepting that there will be equal treatment for all workers in the implementation of this Bill? Our concern in this matter arose from the original section 3(5). It was rumoured that this was directed particularly at teachers, because of the break system and the fact that they have periods of intensive work and somewhat longer holidays than other categories of workers. It could, of course, be equally applicable in other areas of the public service and in private enterprise. It would be helpful if the Minister of State would confirm, on the record of the House, that all categories of workers will be treated equally in the application of carer's leave and carer's benefit.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 27 to 30 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" />&ldquo;(1) When an employee proposes to take a period of carer's leave of between 9 and 18 months, the employee shall, not later that 12 weeks before the proposed commencement of the carer's leave provide notice to the employer. If the period of leave anticipated is of less than 9 months but greater than 6 months duration, a period of 8 weeks notice shall be given and if the period of leave anticipated is less than 6 months, 6 weeks notice shall be given. Notice shall be provided in writing and shall include&ndash;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the 12 weeks notice period may present some difficulty but, where possible, people should plan their leave arrangements well in advance and give their employers notice accordingly. Of course, situations will always arise where employees may need to take leave at much shorter notice and this can usually be accommodated where there is a good relationship between the employer and employee. The difficulty for employers in planning ahead should be taken into account, including the difficulty of finding alternative staff at relatively short notice, perhaps more so in some jobs than in others. Where employees can give longer notice, this would greatly facilitate forward planning. If it is not possible to incorporate such a provision in the Bill itself, this important aspect should be covered in some other appropriate manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody involved in administration in business or in the public sector will appreciate the need for the longest possible period of notice being given by employees proposing to take carer's leave. Decisions have to be made with regard to substitute staff, training arrangements and so on. In the private sector, deadlines often have to be met and failure to do so can affect the company's performance.</P>
      <P>I understand why Deputies Perry and Flanagan framed it this way. Nonetheless, in the context of caring, this is a special function and one in which the widest possible leeway must be given and that is why, in amendment No. 19, the Labour Party still wants section (9)(1) to be reduced from six to four weeks. Emergencies arise and a person would be under pressure maintaining a full-time job while caring for a loved one. As on Committee Stage, we still believe that this is an appropriate period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 refers to subsection (2) which is that in exceptional emergency circumstances where it is not reasonably practicable to give notice in accordance with the period specified in subsection (1), the employee should give that notice as soon as is reasonably practicable. My colleagues on the Opposition benches want to delete the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; which is narrow and ultra restrictive for carers. We were under pressure on Committee Stage on this and, accepting the Minister's good faith over the exceptional emergency circumstances, we still believe that carers should be given the widest freedom in taking leave. This should be left out <Col N="617" /> because often in caring these circumstances arise and, in terms of notice, we could have this section without saying that. The original wording was &ldquo;where it was not reasonably practicable&rdquo;. The Minister went some distance from that, which we welcome. However we will still pursue the broadest possible definition. It is understandable that, when it comes to notice of leave and how operations and enterprises in both the private and public sectors conduct their business, employers could be under pressure.</P>
    <P>In this historic Bill we want to move towards full recognition of the caring function. I discussed privately with the Minister how in the future caring may be recognised as a full scale social economy task that gets a real income, not £96 per week. These amendments seek to move in tiny steps towards a better society. While understanding my Fine Gael colleagues and the Minister, whom I commend and thank for coming some way, I urge him to come the whole way with amendments Nos. 19 and 21, especially amendment No. 19.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Section (9)(1) provides that an employee must give notice in writing to his or her employer at least six weeks prior to the date on which it is proposed that the leave commence, informing him or her that he or she proposes to take such leave and that an application has been made to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs for a decision from a deciding officer or appeals officer, as appropriate, that the person to be cared for while on leave is a relevant person for the purposes of Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, and the date on which it is proposed to commence the period of carer's leave, and the duration of it.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 18 reflects the IBEC view that the notice proposed is not long enough and suggests a period of eight weeks, and is supported by Fine Gael. Amendment No. 19, reflecting the ICTU position, and supported by the Labour Party, proposes that the period of notice of intention to take carer's leave of six weeks should be reduced to four weeks, given the type of situation in which carer's leave may occur, for example, a sudden illness. On Committee Stage, I acknowledged that carer's leave would be availed of to cover circumstances such as sudden illness where shorter notice requirements would be desirable. However, we must not ignore the real difficulties in the labour market of replacing staff at short notice as well as time constraints on officials in the Department in processing applications and medical assessments for carer's benefit and leave. We have struck the right balance. I will not accept either amendment and propose retaining the six week notice period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section (9)(2) provides that in exceptional or emergency circumstances where it is not reasonably practicable for an employee to give notice to the employer of the intention to take carer's leave in accordance with the minimum six weeks prior notice, specified in section (9)(1), then the <Col N="618" /> employee shall give the notice as soon as is reasonably practicable. This is a reasonable compromise. IBEC want &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; without &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; and ICTU want both words removed. We discussed it with both sides and came up with an honourable compromise. Amendment No. 20 proposes the removal of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; in the two places where it occurs. This would weaken the provision and I do not accept it. It is in workers' interests. Amendment No. 21 proposes the removal of the phrase &ldquo;in exceptional or emergency circumstances&rdquo; from section (9)(2). The restriction to such circumstances is reasonable and I do not accept this amendment either. We discussed this in detail on Committee Stage and were lobbied by ICTU and IBEC. My approach in this Bill is to be reasonable to everyone, particularly to workers in emergency circumstances. Our phrasing is the correct one.</P>

If a dispute arises in relation to the application of this subsection, the employee may refer the matter to the rights commissioner under <i>section 19</i> of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We want to delete the last part of subsection (4) and replace it with the proposed words. The key point for us is that if a dispute arises in relation to the application of this subsection, the employee may refer the matter to the rights commissioner under section 19. The Minister moved towards the Labour Party's position by limiting the employer's discretion and making it subject to subsection (8) where the employer may, when exercising his discretion under subsection (4) on the matter of notice, refuse to treat the carer's leave as such leave on reasonable grounds and where the employer so refuses, he or she shall specify in writing the grounds for such refusal. In that context, the Minister of State has come some distance towards meeting the position we set out. He stated earlier that section 19 and the reference to a rights commissioner could be applied to many of the subsections. Clearly, giving notice will be a key element of the implementation of the Bill when it becomes an Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a strong case for making section 9(4) subject to reference to a rights commissioner under section 19, while retaining the advances the Minister of State has made. I com<Col N="619" /> mend the Minister of State on attempting to limit, to some extent, the employer's discretion because in the original Bill, the employer was given very wide discretion in relation to notice. It has been balanced by including the phrase &ldquo;subject to subsection (8) of section 9&rdquo;. Nonetheless, I would like to hear the Minister of State's views on whether we could include section 19 at this stage as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his comments. We touched on this issue earlier when debating another section. In terms of having good, solid and consistent legislation, amendment No. 22 would not effect any substantial change in the Bill and it is unnecessary as its potential has already been achieved by the current text. As the Deputy rightly identifies, section 19 covers that. I reject this amendment on the basis that if one puts this reference into one section, in practice, one might weaken another section by not including it there. I am rehearsing the arguments I used this morning in relation to a similar case. I assure the Deputy that recourse to a rights commissioner is firmly included in section 19 in the case of a dispute arising.</P>

      <P>I welcome that declaration by the Minister of State. It is significant that the application for this will be important. The complexity of this arises from the fact that two Departments and two people, the person doing the caring and the person being cared for, are involved. This part of section 9 illustrates that well. It is one of the reasons we urged the Minister of State to have a review mechanism, which has been put in place. We wanted to ensure that this aspect of the operation of the Bill, the giving of notice, would be subject to review, so we could see how it worked. It is complex in that the two elements are involved in it. I welcome the Minister of State's declaration and on that basis, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Employees must give at least four weeks notice in writing of their intention to return to the employment. This is very short notice, particularly if they have been on leave for a considerable period. A person may decide to opt for a second period of leave. The employer will have taken on somebody else and he or she will have to be given notice to make the vacancy available for the person on leave to return to work under the contractual arrangements which exist. Four weeks is very short notice given the practicalities of operating a business within that timescale. A number of sections provide for six weeks and I am disappointed the Minister of State did not <Col N="620" /> maintain that continuity. It is also important to have the goodwill of the employer. The purpose of this valuable Bill is to provide care and one will find employers very understanding and that they will accommodate everybody concerned. The statutory notice of four weeks in this regard is quite short.</P>

Amendment No. 23 from Fine Gael, which has, I believe, been prompted by IBEC, proposes that this four weeks should be eight weeks.

      <P>Confirmation of carer's leave should be increased from two to four weeks.

Under this subsec<Col N="621" /> tion, an employee and his or her employer must, at least two weeks before the date on which the carer's leave is due to commence, prepare and sign a document referred to in the Bill as a confirmation document which shall specify the date of the commencement of the period or periods of carer's leave and the duration of each period of leave.

      <P>I can reassure the Deputy on this issue. I acknowledge there will be situations such as those set down in the amendment whereby an employer, particularly one with low staff numbers, will seek a postponement of carer's leave to address urgent work requirements. However, given the nature and the circumstances in which carer's leave is likely to be taken, I am satisfied that section 12, as drafted, should provide the necessary comfort factor to employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the postponement, curtailment and variation of the form in which car<Col N="622" /> er's leave may be taken by agreement between the employee and employer concerned. The section also provides that where carer's leave is postponed, curtailed or varied, it may, subject to section 6 which deals with entitlement to carer's leave, be taken at another time, that is, the period of the leave which is so postponed or not taken by virtue of the curtailment. Provisions in section 12 meet the Deputy's concerns. I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister of State's comments on the amendment and that my concerns are somewhat addressed in section 12. It is important that this will be enabling legislation and that it will be reviewed in years to come. This legislation is a good start. While it is important at all times to address concerns raised, it is also important to strike an appropriate balance. Small companies are the backbone of this economy, given that 85% of jobs are created in companies with a staff of fewer than ten. It is important the Bill reflects the development of small companies in our economy and difficulties that would be created if staff take carer's leave in such companies. The amendment to section 12 will address somewhat the concerns in this area.</P>

    <P>(2) Section 19 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, shall apply to the first 13 weeks of absence from work on carer's leave for each relevant person.</P>
    <P>(3) Section 21(1) of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, shall apply to the first 13 weeks of absence from work or carer's leave for each relevant person and shall not apply to public holidays that occur after such period of absence from work.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the issue of annual leave and public holiday entitlements while on carer's leave was a major issue on Second and Committee Stages and I gave an undertaking to revisit this issue on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 32 provides that a person who is on carer's leave shall be only entitled to (a) annual leave during the first 13 weeks of absence from work on carer's leave and (b) to those public holidays which occur during the first 13 week period of absence taken for each relevant person. These provisions are similar to annual and public holiday entitlements under the Parental Leave Act, 1998. It would be unreasonable to expect employers to give employees on carer's leave annual leave and public holiday entitlements for all of the 65 weeks entitlement to carer's leave.</P>
    <P>In many cases an employer will have to temporarily replace the employee absent on carer's leave and the employee will also be entitled to annual leave and public holidays. In those circumstances it would not be reasonable to expect an employer to give full annual leave and public holiday entitlement to the employee absent on carer's leave.</P>
    <P>An entitlement for both annual leave and public holidays in respect of the first 13 weeks of the 65 week entitlement was decided upon as generally under holiday legislation. There is not a right to annual leave for any period of an absence over 13 weeks.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 36 is consequential on amendment No. 32 and, accordingly, I request that they be accepted. In light of these Government <Col N="625" /> amendments I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 33 or 35.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 34, I point out it is standard that time spent on statutory leave is reckonable as a period of service for redundancy purposes and, accordingly, I do not propose to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 33 and 35 are in conflict to some extent with amendment No. 32. We discussed this issue at length on Committee Stage and I accept the Minister of State has come a long way in this regard. While these amendments accept some of the rationale of the Organisation of Working Time Act, they could have been brought into line with provisions in the Parental Leave Act in that it may be unjust to treat a carer in a less favourable way in this regard. I understand the timeframes under the Carer's Leave Bill and the Parental Leave Act are very different. Nonetheless parents who take 14 weeks parental leave are considered to be in employment for the purposes of annual leave and public holidays while carers who take 14 weeks carer's leave to care for an incapacitated parent will be treated less favourably.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has come some of the way towards meeting our concerns. I tried to express this in amendment No. 33 by deleting the words &ldquo;annual leave, public holidays&rdquo; and in amendment No. 35 by asking him to extend the remit of a new subsection (2) to include that an employee on carer's leave for a period of up to 14 weeks would be regarded for the purposes of annual leave and public holidays as still working in the employment and that none of his or her rights in regard to annual leave and public holidays would be affected. I commend the Minister of State for coming part of the way and ask him to go the extra couple of yards or metres to meet this requirement and ensure we do not introduce a new inequality between carer's leave and parental leave.</P>

I accept his comments from the point of view of the employer and the entitlements to bank holidays, public holidays and so on. It is as far as anyone could go on the issue. Amendment No. 34 refers to reckonable service for redundancy. I understand the Minister of State's comments in this regard. On the role of companies in regard to the payment procedure for holidays, which will obviously be paid by employers directly to employees even though they are absent from the company, is there a procedure in place to ensure the payment will be made? </P>

      <P>I spoke earlier about the need to strike a balance. The initiative in this case would be supported by the ICTU, even though IBEC would not be totally happy with me. If that is a reason for winning Deputy Broughan's support I <Col N="626" /> do not take great satisfaction in making anyone unhappy. However one cannot please everyone in regard to these initiatives. We are trying our best to achieve the correct balance on an important issue.</P>
      <P>We are introducing a new provision in respect of annual leave, that is, 13 weeks. As I said to Deputy Broughan, we are talking about parental leave of approximately 14 weeks, from which we are not far away. In this case we are talking about approximately one quarter of a person's entitlements. It is quite a step forward in relation to the rights of employees, which is appropriate. This initiative has stemmed from discussions on Committee Stage. Sometimes we have had to take account of the views of both IBEC and the ICTU. On the earlier question of 12 months, IBEC felt very strongly about the issue. However we have achieved the right balance. I have outlined my position to which I intend to stick.</P>

      <P>This is complex legislation, aspects of which we were considering up to this morning. I can understand the strengthening of the text by including the words &ldquo;termination of carer's leave in accordance with this Act&rdquo;. Does the Minister of State accept there will still be <Col N="627" /> strong concerns regarding the whole area of return to work and employment rights? Under sections 11, 13 and 14 a worker on carer's leave to discharge an important caring function could end up in limbo where they have finished their carer's benefit, a future date is set for them to return to their job and they are left without an income of any kind. Will the Minister of State give a commitment that workers will not find themselves in limbo at the end of the carer's leave period if conditions in relation to notice and termination are properly fulfilled and they are waiting to return to work? I am seeking that all employees' rights under the Bill and the social welfare Acts up to 2001 will be fully implemented. At the end of a caring period which has possibly ended in the death of a family member, carers trying to return to work should not have to face having no means of any kind. The Bill seems to be a little vague in this regard. My colleagues and I would like some clarification to ensure there will be support by way of social welfare benefits and assistance. I am asking for a smooth transition between the period of caring and returning to the workforce. Constituents who have been on carer's leave, discharging the carer's function, should not have to apply for supplementary welfare allowance by visiting their local health board clinic which is often the case when the social welfare system cannot support them.</P>
      <P>As far as possible there should be a smooth transition back into the workforce given that we have now discussed all the elements of how the carer's function could be discharged both in and out of the workforce. There are one or two other elements I would like to have seen amended in this regard. Will the Minister reassure us that he will ensure a smooth transition into the workforce? I know we will have the opportunity, thanks to the Minister's acceptance of section 34, within the next two to three years to have a full consultation with the social partners, the trade union movement, employers and possibly with people who have taken carer's benefit and carer's leave. We will have the opportunity to look back at the legislation then. There is concern about this element and I would like the Minister's views on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of the employee, termination is a better word to use than expiration which would suggest that one would have to see the whole 65 weeks expire. The word termination gives wider rights to the employee. For example, if the leave period ended in an unusual situation such as the person being cared for passing away, that would be a termination as distinct from an expiration. We are trying to ensure the employee is protected in every possible eventuality. We feel the word &ldquo;termination&rdquo; fits any particular situation that might arise. It provides a wider right for the employee.</P>

      <P>One good thing about this Bill is <Col N="628" /> that it will allow carers to take career breaks and I compliment the Minister on that. There may be shortcomings in the system but the whole concept is good. It is good too that even if the person being taken care of passes away, the carer can still resume employment. It seems to be geared towards providing that the carer's job is always there and carers may take a career break for whatever length is needed. It is a much needed and important Bill and everybody is anxious that it should pass before the summer recess.</P>

We are trying to deal with every possible situation and we use that language to ensure that every eventuality is catered for in giving the worker the right to return to work. I can give guarantees on behalf of law abiding people, both employers and employees, in relation to legislation. Later on we will have ways of dealing with those who do not honour the legislation. We are dealing with traumatic situations and having discussed this not just here, but with IBEC and ICTU, I believe there is tremendous goodwill for this legislation. I acknowledge the support of Opposition Members. We will monitor the enactment of this legislation. This legislation will provide tremendous support to an area that needs it. The issue of carers and the need for other avenues to provide care is a very important issue for the House and I am confident that we will see a good response to this legislation from employers.</P>

    <P>It is important that the right to return to work reflects the reality of commercial life where few jobs remain exactly the same as they were before someone left. The job description could have changed since a person took leave and this amendment would reflect the co-operation between employer and employee. The amendment suggests that it would be important that the right to return to work would also reflect the reality. My amendment suggests that a person would return to a job the same or similar to that <Col N="629" /> which they held prior to the commencement of leave. It allows some discretion in that area.</P>

      <P>This issue was raised with me by IBEC following publication of the Bill and we have discussed it further with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. It is considered that the amendment proposed is unacceptable. It is unnecessary because if the employee cannot be returned to the job he or she held immediately before the commencement of the leave then section 15 of the Bill provides that the right to alternative employment should apply.

      <P>The Labour Court would be a more suitable forum than the Employment Appeals Tribunal for all those involved given its less formal and less judicious setting.

      <P>The amendment proposes that the Labour Court should be the appellate body under the Bill. As a consequence to this proposal all reference to the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the Bill would be replaced by references to &ldquo;the Labour Court&rdquo;. It was decided that the Employment Appeals Tribunal should be the appellate body under this Bill because of its previous experience as the appellate body under the Parental Leave and maternity leave Acts. Given the nature and sensitivities of cases likely to be the subject of appeal under the Bill, I am satisfied the Employment Appeals Tribunal is the best place to address these. The Employment Appeals Tribunal has traditionally dealt with individual rights issues, in other words, employment rights issues, while the Labour Court has dealt with interests, that is trade union and collective bargaining issues. I feel strongly that we should leave the Bill as it currently is. The tribunal is the right place for issues which are really individual rights issues. The Labour Court, whose annual report I just launched recently, is very busy and has a great deal on its plate regarding the broader interests of trade unions. The Government is right and this Bill is a move in the right direction.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 53, 61 and 62 reflect a recent Government decision requiring all Bills published before the end of 2001 to show references to monetary amounts in both Irish pounds and euros. The increase in the level of fines reflects the increase in inflation since the general levels of fines were last increased in 1993. The amounts included in the Bill were provided to all Departments on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General. We are breaking new ground here today as the amendment will delete the reference to £1,500 and substitute 3,000, which amounts to £2,362.69. This is the first time I have seen euros mentioned in a Bill. This straightforward amendment increases fines in line with inflation.</P>

      <P>The amendments attempted to resolve the central problem that has been introduced into the Bill by its reference to other relevant legislation. It seems this is the one remaining measure that will put the carer in a more restrictive situation than is the case under other legislation, such as the Parental Leave Act, 1998. I realise the Minister of State mentions this in his amendment, but I am concerned about <i>force <Col N="632" />majeure</i> leave and perhaps he can reassure me. A situation may arise whereby a person has to leave work at short notice, perhaps a few hours, to fulfil a caring function. The many other references in the Bill to giving notice and preparing to receive carer's leave will have to be fulfilled. I am concerned that those who may have to leave for a short time, perhaps to go to a hospital or hospice, may be forced to forsake a full day of carer's leave.</P>
      <P>There is a concern about the operation of <i>force majeure</i>, but I accept that my amendment No. 59 is no longer on the agenda. I tried to ensure that the period in which the employee is absent from work while on <i>force majeure</i> shall be construed in line 10 as reference only to the portion of the day during which the employee was absent. Looking back at section 28, the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, would effectively be amended, so that Act would obviously be affected. I am concerned about the construction of <i>force majeure</i> leave in relation to the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, and the fact that there are concerns that a short absence from work would be construed as a complete day rather than merely a number of hours. I would like the Minister of State to respond to this basic concern.</P>

      <P>We have had a successful debate and, with the permission of the Chair, I remind the Deputy that his amendment was ruled out of order as it specifically refers to parental leave legislation. The Deputy argues that if a person has to leave under <i>force majeure</i> or because of an emergency, perhaps halfway through a working day, it should not be counted as a full day. It is counted as one full day of the three permitted under the Parental Leave Act, 1998. We are clearly in no position to change that as part of this Bill, but I proposed a review of legislation, at an appropriate time, and such a review is currently under way in another Department. I realise I am out of order, but I wanted to clarify the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting, both on Committee Stage and on this Stage, a number of Labour Party amendments and parts of amendments and for accepting the spirit of others and in that way seeking to improve vital legislation. In particular, I commend the staff from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment who have very graciously and thoroughly briefed the Opposition in respect of many aspects of this Bill as well as doing the complicated work of drafting it. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on bringing the Bill to this stage.</P>
      <P>The position of carers in our society is one of the great challenges we face. The Labour Party is determined that after the forthcoming general election one of its most important targets will be the recognition of the caring function at the heart of Irish life, probably through a constitutional amendment and through the implementation of legislation such as we have before us today. The key issue remains the much hated means test in relation to carer's allowance, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern. However, the introduction of carer's benefit and the accompanying carer's leave is an important step forward. Although carer's benefit has been in existence for a year and a half, we on this side of the House regret that it has taken a year and a half to reach this stage in connection with carer's leave. Now, at long last, the two sides of the equation can be brought together.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to reiterate the comments he made about the 214 people who qualified for carer's benefit but who will not have the protection of this Act as they return to work. With that caveat I thank the Minister of State for the debate and congratulate his staff and the Department for getting the Bill through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with Deputy Broughan's comments. I congratulate the Minister and his staff on steering this very important legislation through the House. This country is extremely lucky to have 50,000 full-time family carers who save the State up to £650 million every year by working 24 hours a day. We should never lose sight of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look again at the means test because carers perform an invaluable service. The Carer's Leave Bill will allow people to leave their jobs to look after relatives at home, and this will mean a considerable saving for the State which should allow the Exchequer to give more money to people who take on the role of a carer. This country is blessed with carers who <Col N="634" /> look after people around the clock. In the future we should consider giving more of them an allowance. The allowance, at £96 a week, is a little over half the minimum wage, and we should also examine that.</P>
    <P>This legislation is necessary. People want a permanent structure for taking carer's leave. This legislation will put it on a legal footing. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure this is enacted before the summer recess because a large number of people are waiting to avail of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Broughan and Perry for their work on this legislation not just today but before today. I am determined that it should be enacted before the summer because it is important to have this legislation in place. I also thank my officials who have worked tirelessly, as Deputies know, because they have briefed many Deputies here. They have worked not just on this legislation but on another Bill on part-time workers which we are waiting to get into the system. I hope we will be able to do that sooner rather than later. I also thank the officials in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs with whom we have worked closely, and my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</P>
      <P>Deputies have acknowledged the importance of this legislation. It is interesting that it has not stemmed from an EU directive but is home grown. It fits into the family-friendly approach we have tried to pursue at this level of Government. I have acknowledged the role of ICTU and IBEC. I have also commented on amendments from both quarters here. In trying to steer a middle ground, my motivation in initiating this process was to try to help workers. In acknowledging that many employers have already allowed 214 employees to avail of carer's leave in an informal way which was not bedded down in legislation, I appeal to them to treat those workers in the same way as workers will now be dealt with under this legislation and make sure they are allowed to return to work.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies opposite, my officials and the Ceann Comhairle. We have managed to get this legislation through faster than I expected, and I am pleased to have been able to do so. There is other legislation in this area which fits in with the family-friendly policies the Government is pursuing. I am convinced this legislation will provide a tremendous opportunity to those who want to take 15 weeks out of work to carry out a very important service. I am conscious that many people are currently doing so, often under pressure, for example, where both parents in a family work. From my contact with people I know they are anxious to explore this opportunity. We will make sure information about this new legislation gets into the public domain. The Bill goes to the Seanad around 19 June. I assure the House that the legislation will be in place before the summer recess.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>One area which has the potential to create difficulty is the possibility of frivolous and vexatious complaints against Members. There is concern that this legislation will give rise to more complaints of this nature. There is particular concern that a complaint might be lodged in the run-up to an election and left hanging over a Member during an election campaign. This Bill has not made any major change in this regard. It would be difficult to find a means of discouraging such complaints. It would probably require the introduction of a fairly strong penalty, and that is something we could consider on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Members interests committee looked at the experience in New South Wales in Australia where a permanent independent commission against corruption was set up. Huge numbers of complaints were referred to it and it has a very large staff and very large ongoing costs. In general it has been a most unsatisfactory means of dealing with this entire area. I am glad this Bill does not provide for an independent commission of that nature. One of the cases which was dealt with by that commission, the fairly well known Metherell affair, dates back to 1992. The finding of the commission in that case was overturned in the Supreme Court, but before that the Premier of the day, Nick Greiner, who had a strong record in this regard and the Minister involved, Tim Moore, had both resigned. Between the finding of the commission, which was negative for both of them, and the Supreme Court finding which overturned that, they had both resigned. On the basis of the experience in that jurisdiction, the committee members believed it was not the way to go.</P>
      <P>There was also some concern in the committee about the definition of connected persons. Perhaps that might be addressed on Committee Stage. The committee also pointed out a considerable number of anomalies in the 1995 Act. I am disappointed that section 30, which deals with voluntary declarations, has not been amended. The Bill is drafted to give the impression that if one were to make a voluntary statement of an interest, at a minimum one would be required by law to continue to make that declaration subsequently. In fact, it is not clear that other Members of the House would not be required to make that declaration. That clearly was not intended in the Act at the time but the legal advice we received suggested that is the case. It would be useful if that were addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the provision in Schedule 1, which amends section 29 to provide for corrections to the register. Common sense dictates that such a provision should be in place. I also welcome the amendment to section 7 of the ethics Act to allow for the seeking of advice. However, the amend<Col N="636" /> ment does not address it in the way the committee might have wanted. It should be sufficient for a Member to have sought advice in relation to section 7(2)(<i>b</i>) of the 1995 Act rather than to have made a declaration. Practicality dictates that it is virtually impossible for the committee to give advice before the Member speaks or votes. That is something which has the potential to throw up difficulties in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the 1995 Act provides for Members to seek advice but it does not provide for that to be in writing. The committee strongly believes it should be. Otherwise, there is enormous potential for misunderstanding and misrepresentations of what advice was sought, what information was given and how the advice was subsequently given.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the 1995 Act does not require that a Member against whom a complaint has been made would be informed in all cases. It provides that Members are advised in the event that the Clerk refers the complaint to the committee and in some other cases but not in all cases. The 2000 Bill makes some changes to that but does not provide that the Member against whom a complaint is made be advised in all cases. That is a weakness in the legislation. Complaints might be made against Members of the House and they would not know about it.</P>
    <P>The Dáil committee prepared a code in advance of the preparation of the legislation. It has been placed in the Oireachtas Library and circulated to Members. It contains a number of recommendations. I thank the Members who made submissions, both written and oral, in this regard. At this stage it is only a draft code. I expect it will be dealt with by the committee, debated further and, undoubtedly, altered.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the general area of legislative ethics is seen to be concerned with the behaviour of individual legislators rather than the framework within which politics is conducted. In a sense this Bill and the other Bills being prepared &ndash; one is also before a committee today &ndash; seem to confirm the view that ethical behaviour in politics is all about being controlled by legislation. It certainly is not. It would be better if it were concerned with a wider area and seen in the wider context of politics delivering good government.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the broader context, one sees that many people besides politicians are involved. The 2000 Bill goes some way in addressing this and extending legislation to public servants and others. However, there are other interests involved to whom legislation should, could and, perhaps, will be extended in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Deputy Killeen referred to the various other Bills and pointed out that one was before a committee today. The amount of legislation to deal with corruption or standards in public office is confusing. No matter how much legislation is in place, it is <Col N="637" /> ultimately down to the type of individual elected to represent the people and how they feel because, unfortunately, any legislation can be circumvented.</P>
      <P>Take as an example the declaration of interests. When somebody becomes a Minister, he or she can no longer be a company director and so forth but a family member can become a director. There have been many controversies over the years whereby a Member of the House or a Minister can operate these companies at arm's length. I do not know how one can cater for that situation or whether it is possible to do so.</P>
      <P>Politicians have been under the cosh for a number of years as a result of matters which have come into the public domain. The present and past generations do not have a monopoly on badness or on goodness. What has happened reflects what happens in society, but that does not excuse it. People who hold public office should not only be clean but should be seen to be clean. A higher standard applies to them than to members of the general public. However, it is important to realise that what we have seen happened in several other areas of society. Politics is not the only area in which it occurred.</P>
      <P>The Minister has agreed to amend section 2 on Committee Stage. It deals with the composition of the commission. It comprises a retired or serving judge, the Clerks of the Dáil and the Seanad, the Ombudsman and the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Minister indicated that two former politicians will be added. Is it the case that we see ourselves in such a poor light that we did not include the former politicians from the beginning? The vast majority of politicians are decent and honourable people.</P>
      <P>With regard to corruption and standards in general, part of the problem is to do with the evolution of a state. We have seen it happen in many other countries which have broken away from a colonial past. This country is going through those growing pains. Deputies sit in their clinics and are confronted by people wondering how they can get around a problem. Often we try to circumvent the system. Perhaps we are still trying to put one over on the Queen. Many of us feel we do not have a partnership in this country. We believe it is a great stroke to avoid or evade tax; we are not willing to pull our weight and make a contribution. Until we develop that ethos, we will continue to encounter difficulties with people trying to take a short cut and not pull their weight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this and the other Bills is to restore public confidence in the political system. This Bill deals with a certain code of conduct which the commission or the Houses of the Oireachtas or the Minister for Finance will lay down for Ministers, office holders, Members of the Oireachtas and members of other public bodies. The specifics of the code of conduct will involve the production of a tax clearance certificate after election and a declaration of interests and will ensure Members do not duplicate their <Col N="638" /> declarations of donations. The Bill provides for the establishment of an inquiry officer who, if a complaint is made, will carry out an interview process and report to the commission. The commission will be presented with a report on which it can pass judgment.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is the most important section and deals with the code of conduct. It will deal with conduct and integrity. I will come back to this important section later. Section 15 deals with fines designed to address cases of obstruction of the commission. In almost every tribunal there has been obstruction on the part of some of the people brought before it. This is inexcusable. I hope people who are questioned by or receive requests from tribunals will be fully compliant and forward everything requested. Ultimately, it makes life easier for everybody concerned. Given that the tribunals were established with the unanimous approval of the House and the support of the public, it behoves every Member to co-operate with them.</P>
    <P>Schedule 1 to which Deputy Killeen referred provides for adjustments to the 1995 Act. This deals with where people would make a declaration of interests before a debate and it brings me to the question of the relationship between business and politics. When the Lowry affair broke I remember seeing certain politicians on camera stating that business and politics do not mix and some people would make the case for having full-time politicians. It is important that every walk of life in society is represented in this House. We are all familiar in our own constituencies with the chambers of commerce and with the various contributions which they would make to the debate on how a local area should be developed. It is always important that we are not afraid to go out and interact with people, be they members of the farming community, the business community or the voluntary sector. It is important that their views are represented here. It is also important that people from those various sectors are elected because they can bring a broad view to all the legislation which passes through the House.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to say that business and politics cannot mix. Certainly there is a perception among the public that businesses, which have given donations in the past, have greater access. I do not know whether that is true, but I suppose I can certainly understand how the perception arises. With the limitations on donations and, indeed, my party's policy not to accept corporate donations, which is a good policy, it is not satisfactory that we must go out on the highways and byways to look for donations from members of the public. The time has come when we must grasp the nettle. The public purse will have to finance the democratic system. There is no way around it.</P>
    <P>We often get pilloried in the media for not being professional enough but, although I have only been in opposition, people who have been on both sides of the House would understand that <Col N="639" /> when one is in Government one has all the advantages and back-up. In opposition it is very difficult to do anything. One needs research facilities and one needs funding to carry out that research and to sustain a professional organisation, and the common interest would be served by providing such funding from the public purse. I realise there is a difficulty in that regard with political parties or Independents who are trying to get established and, therefore, some channel must be found to cater for those individuals.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with the code of conduct. In my view this is the most important aspect of the legislation. This comes back to the point I have made on other occasions and which previous speakers have made, that is, how can one legislate for ethics in public office? How can one legislate for ethics in any sphere of activity? It is quite easy, for example, to deal with the simple fact that a person received donation X from Mr. Y, and that he or she declared it. Under the current legislation a Member must declare donations of £500 or more, but we all know that we could get 20 donations of £495, declare nothing and be twice as wealthy as the poor guy who must declare the £1,000 donation he received. Therefore, that aspect of the legislation is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>This Bill addresses many of the academic areas <i>vis-à-vis</i> tax clearance certificates, donations, etc., but the code of conduct is an important element of it. We, as politicians, are guilty of many failings in this area. There is now a limit on the money we may spend on elections but, considering the recent evidence from the tribunals, what is to stop a person spending in the period between elections? If people have access to a great deal of money or income between elections, they are at a far greater advantage because they can spend day and night. No matter how pure we think we are, if we look into our hearts we will see that we are all looking at ways to circumvent the system between now and the calling of an election. We ask ourselves will we place the advertisement in the local paper now for three or four months or will we sponsor a local organisation. Does all that not constitute spending on an election or can we fool ourselves by saying we are doing it out of the kindness of our hearts? In the main it is done &ndash; I am not necessarily speaking for myself here &ndash; for self-advancement or to protect one's electoral well-being in the future. Perhaps that is an area we should look at in the future.</P>
    <P>An area about which I would be very concerned with respect to the code of conduct is conduct at election time. Recent reports on the election campaign in Northern Ireland show that people have been expressing concern. In my view, people are subjected to the same abuses in the South. I will outline one simple aspect of elections to which many traditional election activities might not like to refer, that is, the concept of tallying at election time. As in the past, there are many people who are concerned that the local <Col N="640" /> politician knows who votes for him. I am aware of candidates and supporters of candidates right across the political spectrum intimidating people into voting. People, who I would have been under the impression knew how the system worked, have come to me and asked &ldquo;Won't you know how I voted in the election because the tallymen see the votes coming out of the boxes?&rdquo;  There is a concern and fear about that. If one looks back at certain constituencies in the last local elections, one can see where that view was manipulated. This concept of knocking on the door, putting people into the car and bringing them to vote was acceptable to a certain degree in the past, and some parties were more efficient at it than others. We all did it but I do not know if it is a good practice. It is something we should look at. I am not really in favour of tallying. It is nice to know the results by area but a message should go out to people that, except where there was no vote for a politician in a particular box, the politican would not know if people in a particular area voted for him. A person's vote is private and personal and that is how it should be.</P>
    <P>They say that in life there are three things which cannot be recalled &ndash; the spoken word, the spent arrow and the missed opportunity. I want to refer to the spoken word. It strikes me, as a result of all the innuendo and misinformation going around, that it is now very easy to target somebody and put out a rumour about him or her. Unfortunately in Irish society, particularly when we are out late at night, one man wants to tell a better story than the next and the story evolves. The journalists will always say they have a job to do and I acknowledge that. Without their involvement the tribunals probably would never have been set up in the first instance and, therefore, it is important to acknowledge that. While I do acknowledge that, in last Sunday's newspapers I saw an article about the granting of the Esat licence. The headline stated that £1 billion may be paid in compensation by the taxpayer as a result of the granting of the licence but when I read the article it stated that, notwithstanding that, there is no evidence to show that there was anything untoward about the granting of the licence. I heard another commentator on radio state that a decision was made by the Minister at the time which put £250 million into the pocket of one individual. Such headlines and statements are simplistic. I am not saying that everybody involved is beyond reproach &ndash; I simply do not know &ndash; but I think we should wait until the end of the tribunals to make a judgment about any person, be that person a member of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or an ordinary individual. We should let people defend their good names. On the face of it, certainly the evidence suggests that there are questions which need to be answered and the sooner they are answered, the better. However, in the interim it is important that we get things in perspective and not let the headline cloud the story. Everybody is entitled to space and time to <Col N="641" /> defend themselves and it is not correct to judge people before the final outcome.</P>
    <P>To return to the spoken word, the most important possession of a politician, a public servant or even a child walking down the street is his or her good name. These allegations in the tribunals have led people to think that all politicians are on the take. We face this allegation everywhere. It is so easy to put out a rumour about a person now. Every little action is watched and analysed. When the code of conduct is drawn up, I would like to see it contain a mechanism of redress. There are laws on libel and slander but such cases are extremely difficult to prove. On many occasions people have come to me with a story about someone and when I asked them to put it in writing, sign it or report it to the Garda they have been unwilling to do so. The names of people inside and outside this House are being mentioned on a daily basis and I would ask people to stop and think before they slander someone. I would ask these people how would they feel if somebody said the same thing about them to somebody else. While I would not repeat some of the rumours I have heard about people, certainly they are mind-boggling. It is amazing how members of the public, including politicians, are so willing to believe them. One rumour is better than the next.</P>
    <P>I advise people to keep their own counsel. While I welcome this Bill, it is very important to tie down the academics of it so that people will not be able to abuse the spirit of the law while abiding by the letter of it. How the code of conduct is drawn up and implemented and the responsible behaviour of politicians will assist in restoring confidence in the system. If we as politicians and Members of this House are continually castigating one another, what can we expect the reporters to do but write what they hear. I appeal to all politicians to be constructive and not to personalise our arguments. We must recognise that no one has a monopoly on integrity or on wisdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of the Bill to the House. I agree with much of what Deputy Timmins said when he mentioned the code of conduct and the fact that some people will try to circumvent the code of conduct. The public perception is that politicians are trying to break the rules affecting themselves. The scandals and corruption that have been reported from Dublin Castle have not helped politicians and we have been given a very bad name on that account. Many people believe that decisions are made through money changing hands, as a result of the accounts of the huge amounts of money involved in the scandals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in the codes of conduct proposed in this Bill. For the first time a new commission will be established, the standards in public office commission. I am pleased that this commission will have powers to investigate the complaints about acts or omissions of people in <Col N="642" /> public life. The commission will have eminent members and include the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The Teaching Council Bill, which was recently in this House, deals with standards in the teaching profession and the Bar Council and the Medical Council monitor standards in those professions. It is obviously very difficult to have a commission composed of politicians but the Minister has stated that former politicians will be involved in this commission. The Garda Síochána Complaints Body gives people an opportunity to have a complaint aired.</P>
    <P>This Bill refers to the Whistleblowers Protection Bill, 1999, a Private Member's Bill introduced by Deputy Rabbitte. The legislative protection of those who wish to give information is very necessary. The Minister said that where people make disclosures reasonably and in good faith in relation to their employers or the conduct of business, there will be protection for such people. I am pleased the Government has adopted Deputy Rabbitte's proposals.</P>
    <P>The Electoral Acts which govern expenditure by parties or by individuals are very important. There can be some confusion on the occasion of by-elections because of the efforts by parties and individuals to ensure the election of their candidate, and the guidelines may be breached on occasions. The standards in public office commission will be available to answer any queries. In my constituency of Galway East where Fianna Fáil usually has three or four candidates, there is a good opportunity to spend a very reasonable amount of money on an election campaign. My director of elections told me that we spent £10,000 on four candidates in the last general election. That is a reasonable amount and could be seen perhaps as good value for money.</P>
    <P>I do not see any point in spending huge amounts of money. The amount spent on posters is scandalous. Perhaps the Litter Acts could be used against people who do not remove posters when a campaign is over. I note that many of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote posters for the Nice Treaty referendum do not have any ownership details. Overspending on elections caused a lot of controversy in the United Kingdom at the last general election. It is immoral and unnecessary to spend such huge amounts on elections.</P>
    <P>The Government is considering a registration system for lobbyists. Many people believe that lobbyists have a very strong role in ensuring that legislation is passed through this House. Politicians could be called lobbyists because we all lobby for those who are disadvantaged. The Bill does not deal with tax clearance for lobbyists and I ask the Minister to consider this. I agree with the idea of a tax clearance certificate for politicians who stand for office. Many Deputies and Senators have highlighted the necessity for this regulation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the work of the McCracken tribunal and to the value of the Eth<Col N="643" /> ics in Public Office Act. They have emphasised the importance of monitoring the tax clearance systems and the statutory declarations in relation to tax compliance. In July 1998, three committees of the House had been examining the issues and their deliberations became known as the Blue Book. The Standards in Public Office Bill will take into account what has been achieved and what was recommended by those committees. I am pleased that the Minister has highlighted the role of committees. We are all aware of the fine work done by the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees. The Oireachtas Joint Committees on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and Public Enterprise and Transport will shortly consider other reports to be produced under their remit.</P>
    <P>In addition to praising the role of committees, the Minister referred to the fact that one or two former politicians would be appointed to the commission. I welcome this provision as these people would have expertise in this area and would not undermine the commission's independence. MEPs attend Oireachtas committee meetings, particularly meetings of the Joint Committees on Foreign Affairs and European Affairs and local authority members, who have their own representative association, regularly meet with Ministers or send delegations to the Oireachtas. However, the role of former politicians has never been seriously addressed. Perhaps the Minister would consider the request from members of an association of former politicians for a very basic office facility in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Some Members of this House have suggested that former politicians could play a role in the diplomatic service and I agree that this would be worth pursuing. We should make it very clear that, in spite of complaints made against politicians, there is no question of a club being in operation. Some 25% of elected representatives change at every general election through people retiring or losing their seats. Former politicians should have a role to play in the commission; their experience could also be valuable to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>A distinction appears to be made between office holders and ordinary Oireachtas Members. I do not favour such a distinction as we are all answerable to our constituents. If complaints are made against particular politicians, the politicians in question should be informed of the nature of the complaints, as should the Houses of the Oireachtas. I do not believe any great difficulties would arise in regard to reports of complaints, whether they refer to office holders or ordinary Members, coming before the Houses and appropriate disciplinary action being taken if it is warranted. The Minister referred to duplication and I would welcome clarification on this matter. We should avoid difficulties arising on what constitutes a donation or a gift.</P>
    <P>On tax clearance certificates, the Minister referred to penalties ranging from fines of £50 to <Col N="644" /> £2,000 to a term of imprisonment from three to six months. We cannot treat this matter lightly in the legislation. The electoral legislation has given rise to some controversy on the issue of spending. Spending should be clearly defined. I have seen reports of child care being regarded as an expense, although I believe the reference was removed from legislation in the Seanad. In the main, women pay child care expenses and the inclusion of child care as an expense could result in legislation being viewed as anti-family.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to how candidates and political parties spend money. Members of a political party may have to divide money 50:50 between party headquarters and constituency organisations. They could quickly find that money they thought was available had already been spent by another element of their organisation. These issues must be thrashed out and clarified. Independent politicians may have greater control over the manner in which money is spent.</P>
    <P>In some cases, one election agent may deal with up to four candidates and he or she may attempt to keep election expenditure below a certain limit. It appears that under this legislation, an agent could end up carrying responsibility, paying a fine and facing a possible threat of imprisonment while candidates, who could be spending other funds, could get off scot-free. We must make it clear in legislation that it is political candidates who should take responsibility in these matters. It would be very unfair if agents were to suffer for candidates' wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation which will provide for the establishment of a very strong commission to address complaints about public servants and I welcome the fact that people making complaints will be protected by the whistleblower provisions. I particularly welcome the introduction of a code of conduct for Oireachtas Members. Hopefully, reporting rules will become more streamlined as a result of the electoral and ethics legislation and this Bill. Tax compliance requirements for Oireachtas Members, members of the Judiciary and senior public servants are also very important.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Committee on Members' Interests and other Oireachtas committees which deal with issues relating to politicians. The electoral reform and ethics legislation, together with the standards in public office legislation, facilitate politicians and other public servants to properly serve the public. While some clarification is required on certain issues relating to funding, this Bill is a very positive development in our legislative programme. Go raibh míle maith agaibh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill. In 1963, Professor Basil Chubb published an article entitled &ldquo;Going Around Persecuting Civil Servants&rdquo; which subsequently became one of the most quoted articles in Irish political science. The article purported to be an analysis of Irish politi<Col N="645" /> cal practice at the time and from it derived most of the considerations of the politician's role, usually set up in terms of the duality between the demands of being a legislator and the duties of a political representative. From that work in 1963 I remember my own work with others in the 1970s and the 1980s which made an analysis of clientelism. Much of my work in the 1970s and 1980s has been overtaken by changes that have taken place in the political system but the biggest single change has been the fall in the public conception of politics.</P>
      <P>This legislation is welcome and has to be seen in the context of a series of legislation that will govern the practice of politics but will not necessarily save politics. Saving politics, that is restoring confidence in politics, requires actions that are far wider than politicians being willing to impose disciplines on themselves and to be accountable in such matters as taxation and so on. There is no doubt that among the changes that have to take place is the adequate teaching of the concept of citizenship in the schools. The suggestion is that public space is important, that ethics are important. A change that has taken place in the time I have been in politics is the decline in the politics of the public space and its substitution by a politics of the persona.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the politics of the personal, which is a phenomenon to be observed in other political systems, people operating right of centre will offer personal tax reductions and people who are to the left will seek to offer programmes which are attractive on a personal basis by the individual voter. This is a great limitation of politics. The big issue still remains. That the big issues are not central in politics reflects also something else, that is the decline in the power of parliament in every country in western Europe <i>vis-à-vis</i> the larger corporations that surround it. Somebody pointed out recently in an international journal that of the top 100 major economies, 47 were countries while 53 were international corporations. As well as that there have been such welcome developments in our case as the partnership model but beyond that there have been certain corporate tendencies which have moved decisions out of parliament into the fringes of politics itself. Therefore, parliament is under some pressure from a public that is not giving much opportunity to its citizens in political education, even though I fought in the 1970s to have the subject introduced for the junior certificate. Also, there is a rising kind of populism associated with the politics of the personal. It is interesting, but one is almost not free to say it, no more than one was in the 1970s, to note the hostility towards the politics based on ideas that exists in this country. All we needed to do in the old days was to suggest a complicated topic and people would flee in all directions. When I was writing about politics in the 1970s and 1980s I noted a number of different features of reform that might happen. Unusually for me I pay tribute to the Fianna Fáil Party for <Col N="646" /> some of the reforms because it has always been among the first to provide facilities for Deputies. It has a good record in that regard. I mention that because it will compensate for one or two things I may want to say before I finish.</P>
    <P>In relation to all kinds of reforms, most of us who are political scientists spoke about the absence of a committee system. In the Danish system there is an effective committee system where a person who wants a career in politics might choose the path of committees he or she wants to be in and there are crucial ones if one is making one's way towards the Cabinet. The committee system in the Danish parliament has the opportunity of access to the public service to draft legislation and a right of access to the Legislature. Those of us who were writing at that time wrote about the monopoly which the Government of the day had over the public service in relation to the drafting of legislation. The committee system here was dragged in. I wrote in 1981 about the need for a foreign affairs committee. Despite the most elaborate opposition, it was established on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis by elected members. That committee system is not funded adequately in terms of research, the ability to take the minutes of the committees or in terms of publishing its findings. It is a scandal.</P>
    <P>In relation to Members and referring to Basil Chubb's article, if TDs are to be legislators there must be somebody to assist them in reading the legislation and preparing for the committee. That is a separate function entirely from that of a constituency secretary. One moves on from that to ask whether it is 80 members of the media who are accredited to Leinster House. Are they covering the committees? I am simply saying the disciplines contained in this legislation are welcome. All Deputies who have contributed are warmly in favour of it. It must be put in the context of other legislation but it will not save politics.</P>
    <P>When I entered politics I went to a meeting in a rural area where a beautifully turned out woman stood up and said she did not know what I was on about. She said she had an absolutely lovely life. She was happy and was cooking a meal for her professional husband and was not one bit political. This was followed by a round of applause. I said it must be the only country in the western world where one got a round of applause for self-confessed ignorance, following which some mayhem ensued. There is not anything superior about not being interested in politics and it is a disgrace that some people do not vote. It is not the fault of politicians that some people do not vote. In Australia one has to exercise one's vote. One can write any obscenity one wishes on the ballot paper and say what one likes about John Howard. One either has to have a medical certificate or vote. If we are serious about citizenship we must have the courage to take on those who say it is acceptable not to vote, to be against politics and so on.</P>
    <P>Moving beyond the parliamentary reforms that are required, if we were to make politics a vibrant <Col N="647" /> entity, there must be respect for the profession of politics. The late Noel Browne, who had trained to be a doctor, and who had spent so much time training to be a professional remarked how little training there is to be a politician. Yet one sails into the Cabinet. I had the privilege of being a member of two Cabinets. We have excellent members of the public service but they know one is transient, and their hopes of preferment are often more serious than one's own.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that those senior civil servants who take, for example, decisions in relation to privatisation, deregulation or whatever, should occupy positions in the private sector that involve activities related to those on which they gave a professional opinion. That is unconvincing. There should be a period between the holding of such positions and taking a position in private life, or if one wishes to do so it should be in a different position from that in which they were involved.</P>
    <P>There is another point on which I hold strong views. It is a pity Deputy Kitt of Galway East, in whose constituency three TDs were elected for £10,000, is not present. Would that such frugality migrated to Galway West where it took nearly £50,000 to elect one. I have never spent more than £11,000 on an election. I have no difficulty about the costs being published. On the question of the funding of political parties, I have arrived at a personal opinion that is strongly in favour of State funding. I am not at all moved by weak arguments that suggest the public would not wear it. There is certainly a case for State funding of political parties in a post-tribunal vibrant democracy with active political activity decentralised and with more accountability and transparency. Funding of independents or people trying for the first time is not an insuperable difficulty. This has been dealt with in other systems. It would then be possible to simply ban donations altogether so that we could get on with the business of being professional politicians.</P>
    <P>Most politicians in all parties I know entered politics to give public service. Some who lost their seats, even where they had gone full term, relied on half their salary with their widows in turn relying on half of that, which was a quarter. It is unfortunate that the media covering the tribunals refer to &ldquo;the payments to politicians tribunals&rdquo;. It is payments to a very small number of politicians. It would help if the media said &ldquo;payments to certain politicians&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some of us entered politics without the slightest inclination to want to live the life of the last days of the Borgias or to own islands or to fly here and there buying Palladian buildings etc. Be that as it may, there are two sides to a corrupt transaction in politics. It is not accidental that a certain section of those who have sent people to the tribunals have been associated with speculative building land. Let us call a spade a spade. There is a tribunal dealing with speculative builders' attempts to bribe and corrupt a certain number of politicians and public officials. That does <Col N="648" /> not mean politicians have to go around in sackcloth and ashes saying, &ldquo;There but for the grace of God go I&rdquo;. Most politicians have never had such an impulse but it is clearly important to identify what has happened and who was involved and the kind of politics they had.</P>
    <P>There are many different models for ending that. I favour State funding of parties, even if it is not likely to get general public support. We should at least ban corporate donations. Here we are arguing this ethics legislation. Is there a debate in IBEC about ethics in the corporate world? Is that a world, which is supposed to be a kind of jungle? I will say nothing negative about Mr. Denis O'Brien, except that he enjoyed a popularity among the Irish public in the 1990s that Mother Teresa did in the 1980s. Most of people wanted him to come to their dinner to say how the magic occurred and find out how they also could become a half billionaire by producing nothing except getting a licence from the Government on a free good that was once owned by the people.</P>
    <P>If we want ethics, let us have ethics, but I am not running under any bush in relation to making this statement for the importance of politics, civil society or citizenship. It is very important that the way we do our business in these Houses is properly funded and serviced. We should not be funded out of a subhead from another Department. The Houses should have their own Vote, research staff and spokespeople. We seem to be required to apologise for being politicians; I do not.</P>
    <P>I spent 23 years as a senior university lecturer. For most of my life I had another career. The career I left had a salary that was about 30% greater than that of a TD. I won a seat, lost it, regained it and had the privilege of serving in a Cabinet. That describes most of the people in this House who had careers they abandoned. If that is the case, I hope we can all work together to go forward with reforms. I am disappointed that it seems so difficult to get even the most minimal change to the way we do our own work.</P>
    <P>Draft legislation is published after an election and at the beginning of each Dáil session. When I was a Minister I was told that it took seven years to train a draftsperson for legislation. That is about two Dáil terms. To deal with a backlog, we had to contract out some of it and had a 75 year old man producing great legislation at a rate of knots. There should be a different way of speeding up the legislative process.</P>
    <P>We must be committed to being full time TDs. I am against the dual mandate. Working on general legislation and on the Oireachtas committees requires a great deal of time. I listened with interest to some of the previous speakers about the voyeuristic destruction of people's private lives and the notion of rumour. That is as old as Rome, where they used to say <i>fama est</i> and a rumour would spread. As the people on the opposite side of the House know, an American <Col N="649" /> president once said: &ldquo;I am damned if the truth can ever catch up with a good lie&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have reached a pass in politics because of a number of people who were involved in certain kinds of speculative business activity. It is a great pity they were overwhelmingly from the Fíanna Fáil Party and the larger parties. That is simply explained; to get the desired result, people went to those with the biggest clout.</P>
    <P>I am happy the Labour Party has emerged intact from this process. I remember my colleague, the former Deputy, Eithne Fitzgerald, raising questions about all of these things. It is unfair to say that we must all carry the burden of some great shadow that is cast over politics. The Fíanna Fáil Party would be better off if it acknowledged openly that a small number of its members were responsible and that the majority of its members were not and are not involved.</P>
    <P>Irish people have a curious, humorous and kind of affectionate sense. Having voted in such overwhelming numbers to put the people that are now in front of tribunals at the top of the polls, they find it very difficult to accept they might have been wrong. They explain it in the simplest way by saying all the politicians were at it. That enables people to evade the moral conclusion that they had voted for someone quite consciously who was getting away with something they hoped might benefit themselves. If the politician was doing it for himself or herself and succeeding, like being there in the last days of Rome, maybe the country would benefit indirectly and down the road so would those voters.</P>
    <P>Those days are over, but the moral renewal has to come across the public system in the full civil society. One can support this legislation with minor suggestions for amendments that will come at the next stage. It is part of a package, to which we should commit ourselves. We should not regard it as of lesser importance. It is vital that we give ourselves the resources and the freedom to be politicians. We should be proud to be public servants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister and his officials on bringing this important Bill before the House. This Government has been to the forefront in the introduction of a very comprehensive range of measures designed to improve and underpin general probity in the conduct of public affairs in this State. Fianna Fáil itself, although other political parties seem reluctant to acknowledge this, has given a strong lead and example in the management of its own internal and external conduct by the adoption last year of a detailed mandatory code for office holders and candidates on standards in public life. This code was adopted unanimously at the party's last Ard Fheis. When the Taoiseach took office, he gave a commitment to tackle corruption and malfeasance in public life and that commitment has been honoured diligently. The Bill now before the House is a further part of the growing statutory framework designed to regulate the behaviour of elected rep<Col N="650" /> resentatives who play an active role in public life. The welfare and prosperity of the people on whose behalf they work is critically dependant on the quality and integrity of their decision making. No less than the best is good enough.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a Standards in Public Office Commission to investigate complaints about office holders, including members of the Oireachtas and certain public servants. The Commission will also take over the functions of the Public Offices Commission in relation to the Electoral Acts and the ethics Act. There will be a tax clearance requirement for politicians, senior public servants and judges, codes of conduct for office holders and a regime for dealing with breaches of the legislation. I welcome the provisions for streamlining the disclosure requirements under the ethics and Electoral Acts. Anything which reduces the administrative burden, confusion and legal ambiguity with which Members have to deal in terms of compliance can only be an improvement.</P>
      <P>Consolidation of the law in this area would be beneficial. Ireland already has an enviable reputation internationally as one of the least corrupt societies. This reputation has been fostered, since independence, by generations of politicians and public servants who successfully continued and enhanced the best features of the British parliamentary and administrative behaviour. The majority of our politicians and public servants have been, and continue to be, very honourable people, displaying integrity in the discharge of their duties. We need to restore confidence, which has been somewhat shaken, in our public institutions and those who operate them.</P>
      <P>If the new commission achieves its purpose, it will also limit the need for tribunals and the enormous cost which those bodies impose on the public purse. Many people are uneasy that their interests are being protected at the price of enriching the legal profession. The proposals in this Bill have considerable consequences for the working of our democratic institutions. They are aimed at ensuring the leaders in society and those who run our public services act in an ethical and impartial manner. The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, already requires Oireachtas Members, Ministers and public servants to provide details of their financial interests outside of their public duties. That loss of personal privacy is deemed necessary for the public good and to ensure democratic accountability. I support the view that ethical standards should also apply in the corporate sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to have a strong and independent public body with investigative powers to scrutinise complaints or allegations that inappropriate financial transactions have raised the question of a person's fitness to conduct his or her public business properly. That is what this Bill is mainly concerned with. Tax clearance will become mandatory for Oireachtas Members, judges and senior public servants and there will be mandatory codes of conduct to guide them in <Col N="651" /> the impartial discharge of their duties in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in conjunction with other measures contemplated and pending, clearly demonstrates that this Government is committed to achieving the highest standards in public life. Our Taoiseach has emphasised that on many occasions. Legislation currently before this House will provide a new basis for the prevention, prosecution and punishment of corruption by public officials. The Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 2000, represents a significant tightening up of the law on donations to political parties and individuals. The Local Government Bill, 2000, proposes a comprehensive conduct regime for local authority members and officials. Whistleblowers legislation, to which earlier speakers referred, is being progressed by way of amendment to an existing Labour Party Private Members' Bill, showing that this Government is open to accepting good ideas from other sources. The Government also plans to introduce legislation to register and regulate the activities of paid lobbyists. Nobody in the media or on the Opposition benches can credibly accuse this Government of foot-dragging on measures to improve standards in public life.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives rise to an important issue in relation to the growing compliance cost for Deputies, among others, due to the increasing raft of regulatory measures under which they have to maintain records, supply information and provide returns which will stand public scrutiny. Deputy Jim Mitchell made some relevant points on this some time ago, in an earlier debate as a backbencher. I have some sympathy with the views he expressed. Deputies, as distinct from Ministers, have little resources to meet their obligations under the various statutes and regulations. That inadequacy will be further highlighted in the event of a Deputy finding himself or herself the subject of a complaint to the new commission. Depending on the nature and content of a complaint, Members can conceivably find themselves put to the expense of hiring legal, financial, accounting or other professional advice to defend their good name and reputation. This is a matter which the Minister should consider and address in the context of an appeals procedure. I suggest that it is somewhat anomalous that, in a measure designed to raise standards in public life, there may be a danger that an individual who is the subject of a complaint and investigation may be denied due process and the opportunity to vindicate his or her good name, either through a lack of resources or a deficiency in the procedures.</P>
    <P>The inadequacy of resources available to Oireachtas Members, compared to other parliaments, was also raised by Deputy Jim Mitchell and by my colleague, Deputy Conor Lenihan, on previous occasions. In his testimony to the Committee of Public Accounts last year, the Clerk of the Dáil stated that the Oireachtas was at the bottom of the league of European parliaments with regard to resources and backup for public rep<Col N="652" /> resentatives. He gave some figures which I will quote. The EU average for staff per member is 2.55 while our figure is 1.2. The EU average budget per member is £380,000, compared with our figure of £180,000. The ongoing neglect and under-resourcing of the Oireachtas has been put into sharp focus by the creation of the assemblies in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. One of the important strands of the Good Friday Agreement provides for increased links and contacts between all parliaments of this island. It is disgraceful that this State's sovereign Parliament is so badly resourced in comparison to our immediate neighbours, including Stormont. If we are stretched to perform our parliamentary duties, how fitted are we to cope effectively with the growing burden of compliance? The Minister should look at these issues.</P>
    <P>The way in which the commission will fulfil its remit on a day to day basis concerns me. It ought to review the work practices of the Public Offices Commission, which if the anecdotal and actual evidence is to be believed, represents political correctness gone mad. The instance of the Labour Party candidate in the Dublin South Central by-election is a case in point. A Deputy was fined although he was unaware of the offence. I urge the Minister to charge the commission to establish a common sense code of practice for the conduct of its day to day affairs. Some of the current commission's interventions in the electoral arena are pettifogging in the extreme. These bring well intentioned procedures and institutions into disrepute. Notwithstanding these criticisms, this is a sound, well intentioned measure, requiring some improving, but I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy Michael Higgins earlier speaking about Mother Teresa. To enter politics, one would need to be Mother Teresa, a god or a saint. We have gone too far. We have gone mad bringing in rules and regulations. One would think politicians are the only people who commit sins. Once in this country there was only one sin and that was with regard to sex. Today the sin is politics. If you are a politician, you are a sinner. People are stoning us day in and day out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entered this House in June 1994 after a by-election. We ran the election on about £8,000. We had to borrow money and fought the forces of the State &ndash; the Government, Ministers, press secretaries and the rest. I was lucky to win. In 1997 I spent about £9,000. There were colleagues in my party and in Fianna Fáil who spent £50,000 in the election. Not one penny nor one pound buys one vote more. The people cannot be codded by pounds, shillings and pence. A valid point about this Bill, and it is true since Adam and Eve, is that something that is right is right, something that is wrong is wrong. If a politician from any party takes £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000 from an individual, that is corruption and he or she should be prosecuted. There are no lunatics out there. If a person gives a politician such a sum <Col N="653" /> and he takes it, he commits a sin, an offence. He is being bought and compromised. There should not be any place or protection in this House for such a politician.</P>
    <P>This measure is rubbish. We go too far in setting up a commission to investigate us. Now, when we come into the House, we almost need a legal team to ensure that if we go to the toilet, we do not use the Oireachtas's toilet paper. It has gone so far that we must account for toilet paper and it is a step too far. We must weed out the politicians in this and previous Houses who took money and made decisions to benefit certain people. They must be rooted out. As Deputy Michael Higgins said, that is what gives politics, politicians and this House a bad name.</P>
    <P>We as politicians are to blame for much of this. Politicians in this House make allegations in the media against Members, sometimes true and sometimes not, to which the Members must respond. The greatest sin and scandal is that we took the powers, decisions and the ruling of the country out of this House. That is why we are not accountable to the people. There would be fewer tribunals if Ministers had to account and answer questions here. With no disrespect to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle, we do not have debates here any more. Everything is orchestrated, like Question Time, for example. If I ask a question the Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not like, the Minister is protected under Standing Orders from answering it. Announcements with regard to Bills should not be made on <i>Morning Ireland</i>, the radio show. These are the Houses of Parliament to which we are elected. The programme managers the civil servants have more power than the Deputies.</P>
    <P>Recently I was at a public meeting about an executive decision taken by council officials. The Garda, the engineer and council officials were present, but the politician was lacerated. The politician only was blamed. The council executive made the decision, the Garda implemented it, and the politician was blamed for it. It is time we spoke up for ourselves. I spoke to a Deputy who gave 36 years of his life to this House and now has a pension of £310 per week. If he had not worked a day, had not entered this House nor stood for election and had a non-contributory pension, he would get £200 per week. He is £110 better off after 36 years' service to the House. The media would say I am talking rubbish. I know a woman whose husband spent 14 years in this House. He travelled long distances to be here and his family suffered. They had little money then in politics. Up until the last increase, she was getting a contributory State pension of £86 per week. Until she reached 70 she was refused free schemes because she had a contributory pension. She was penalised because her husband served the country. If she had not worked and he had done nothing for the State, she would have got the full non-contributory pension, free schemes and would not have to pay for refuse collection. <Col N="654" /> She would have been better off. Let us stop the joking.</P>
    <P>Politicians who take money are corrupt and should be cleaned out. There is no place for them in the House. However, this kind of measure is rubbish. Deputy Micheal Higgins will not like me saying that former Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald introduced the most outrageous legislation, the Freedom of Information Act. Why should the public be able to read in <i>The Irish Independent</i> or <i>Sunday Independent</i> what I have or have not? That is no business of the public. If I were a Minister, I would accept that there should be an obligation on me to register what interests I have and, when dealing with a Department, that I should declare a conflict of interest, if there is one. Why should one have to go down to the pub where Joe Soap will say, &ldquo;I see you have shares in AIB and property here&rdquo;? What business is it of the general public what I have or have not? Why should it be acceptable to make a joke about one's business? We have gone mad in this House. We are afraid to speak out because we are afraid of the media. If we are doing nothing wrong&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I spoke in favour of an approach to western development based on a properly structured concept of regional planning. I mentioned a number of the shortfalls of that but, particularly, the extraordinary contradictions that arise from going ahead with an announced programme of expenditure without a time scale in the absence of a spatial plan. The statements by the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, my colleague in Galway West, in this regard have been singularly unhelpful. I recently received a communication from Mr. Sean Hannick, who is now chair of Council for the West, in which he invited all of us to indicate our support for the Western Development Commission. I do not have the slightest difficulty in indicating my support for western development but I repeat what I said last night that it is best done on the basis of a properly constructed regional strategy.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, is reported in <i>The Irish Times </i>of Friday, 2 March 2001 as saying that what most people in the west are fed up with is tokenism, that they just want basic things done right, like roads and telecommunications, and that they do not need more token agencies. Mr. Scollan, chief executive of the commission, replied: &ldquo;It is only a token if the Government is not listening.&rdquo;  The Minister of State suggested that his refusal to take responsibility then for the Western Development Commission was based on the fact that the people were fed up with tokenism and do not need token agencies. I find this attitude to the Western Development Commission by the Minister of State with responsibility for rural development quite extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also does not have much faith in the Cabinet's committee &ndash; the forum of western Ministers. About six meetings of this forum had been held but it did not meet the approval of the Minister of State. He stated: &ldquo; I attended once and never again. I didn't find it a productive use of my time,&rdquo;. I find this quite extraordinary. The suggestion is in its cute, quiet and intellect way that ideas, work and structures do not matter. It is a case of &ldquo;bain díot do chóta&rdquo;. If only the Aire Stáit could get a chance to take his coat off and go foostering around the west, everything would be fine and he would give them long and interminable lectures about roads and infrastructure and <Col N="657" /> how one could count to five in a hundred different ways. Frankly, it is insulting to those on the Western Development Commission. It is a quite outrageous neglect of an opportunity to develop the west.</P>
    <P>Mr. Scollan, in reply to the Minister of State, suggested it was only tokenism if the Government did not allocate funding for the development of the west. That is the important principle. It is also equally clear, as Mr. Scollan pointed out in an act of transparency, that the number of staff attached to the Western Development Commission is very inadequate with two people assessing all the projects that have come in. He made the point correctly, as one should in public service with prudence, that due diligence has to be done. Resources need to be made available. That would be the way to do it and then one could get the Western Development Commission working and would be able to co-ordinate the co-activity of other agencies and Departments.</P>
    <P>I noted an interesting thing that whenever one is unhappy with a Fianna Fáil Minister, one invites all the politicians to come on board. We are on board except the Minister of State who is hanging on to some other raft of his own invention. There are important issues to which a clear answer should be given. Perhaps in reply someone will explain to me how one can call the spatial development plan a plan when one has consultation meetings mid-week when Deputies are in Leinster House but one says that something is to be in the terms of reference and that we are just beginning. Over the next year or two a number of different position papers will be prepared but, as I pointed out last night, people are asking very basic questions &ndash; non-party questions &ndash; such as what is the future of rural villages? What is the future of rural housing? What is the future of different kinds of agriculture &ndash; of agriculture that is congested and in fragmented holdings where there are specific peculiarities of soil, drainage, distance from market and economic issues which do not allow one to have all the benefits of large scale production and so forth? One could listen to people and could establish the basis for a plan. Where the Minister of State is, to some extent, half right is that much of this has been studied before. However, it is not going to be assisted by this business of bad mouthing the Western Development Commission because much could be done.</P>
    <P>A number of principles could be of assistance. The first of these relates to rethinking the future of agriculture. One has to bear in mind that the guarantee side of CAP has not brought benefits to the western counties in a way that a more imaginative use of the guidance section of the CAP would have done. Much more important &ndash; we have to go beyond this now &ndash; one must realise that an agricultural policy will not suffice and that what one needs is a broadly based rural renewal policy. This is what people want. Last night I spoke of the two sides of the same coin &ndash;<Col N="658" /> our urban dis-economies and congested cities and infrastructure being neglected.</P>
    <P>There is a need for institutional reform. This is very important in relation to the institutions that will handle rural policy. There is a need to build a rural policy on a basis of social partnership with the concept of consultation redefined, as I said last night. No longer will citizens accept as consultation that which has been decided for them for a number of days. Rural policy should have a central goal. Rural poverty, exclusion and disadvantage must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The rural policy intervention needs to be targeted and costed. The infrastructural investment in new forms of rural services must be central to any rural policy. It is not only about one's income, it is about one's life &ndash; access to health services and the way the elderly are taken care of. Putting the environment centre stage as rural renewal policy is vital. I welcome proposals in relation to the possibilities of organic farming, for example. Farming, while it will remain central to any rural policy, needs a crucial focus &ndash; for example, getting back to being able to take advantage of high quality for the consumer.</P>
    <P>Reform cannot come from Dublin only. It also needs to take into account how the west is affected by decisions taken in Brussels. Could we at least have a commitment that there will be time scales on this hotchpotch of projects that are contained in the national development plan? Could we also say that we will start a culture of listening as a prelude to a genuine concept of consultation?</P>

      <P>I welcome what the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has been doing, particularly under the national development plan. The announcement he made, which was repeated by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, last night, regarding the allocation of £3 billion for water and waste water services is important to County Galway. Water is a basic facility. A total of £1 billion was to be spent in this area up to 2000. County Galway has more group water schemes than any other county. Some people are willing to pay £1,000 per house to get access to a water supply. Priority has been given to the rural water programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Group water schemes have improved and more emphasis has been placed on improving the quality of water in such schemes. Some 70% of the proposed investment will occur in the Border, midlands and western region. The development of a water supply from the Corrib has been of particular benefit to north Galway and from there along the route to Galway city. The small group schemes must be given access to a water supply as quickly as possible. The costs of the provision of a scheme in Galway are very high. The Minister has increased the grants substantially but <Col N="659" /> there are delays in obtaining them. The European Union has stressed the need to use local authority sources for rural group water schemes.</P>
    <P>Improvements have been made to sewerage schemes. Small towns have been put on a priority list and the introduction of the rural renewal scheme is important. The cost of sewerage schemes has been reduced with the introduction of rebased sewerage schemes. The first scheme in County Galway was in Williamstown which was officially opened by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the improvements to the rail services. Additional services have been provided from Dublin to Galway. The provision of an earlier train service from Galway city to Dublin means people can make early hospital appointments and business meetings. Similar developments should occur elsewhere in the western region, particularly on the Sligo to Claremorris line, on which the carrying of passengers and freight was popular many years ago. With the development of the forestry industry, there is a need to develop that line and the line from Tuam to Athenry and on to Galway city which is famous because part of &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo; was filmed in the Ballyglunin area. If that line were developed it would ease the traffic congestion on the road from Tuam into Galway city. While new roads will be provided under the national development plan, rail transport is another good option as passengers can travel by rail right into Eyre Square. As Iarnród Éireann has stated the upper speed at which trains can travel on that line is 20 miles per hour, major investment is required. I wish to pay tribute to Fr. Michael MacGréil who for a long time has promoted the need to improve the rail service to the west.</P>
    <P>It is important to create jobs in small towns. While progress has been made on Objective One regions, with announcements for Donegal, Longford and Cavan, I hope announcements will be made soon for Ballinasloe where the AT Cross factory, which was a major employer, closed. A site is available there which was developed by the IDA and we hope a flagship industry will locate in the town. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, is a native of Ballinasloe and I know she will not spare herself in seeking to attract industry to the town.</P>
    <P>The development of the road network in the west would attract industry there. There are proposals for the building of a major road network in the region. Improvements to the road from Galway to Dublin are costed at £1 billion. It and the N2, N3, N4, N5 and N6 routes serve the western counties. In addition to those primary routes, the Minister has increased the non-national roads grant in recent years. Those grants and roads have a valuable social and community function. Some of the road developments have been painful for many people, particularly where new roads have bypassed towns or have traversed people's properties. If one considers the progress made <Col N="660" /> regarding the national gas pipeline, one will realise that such problems can be overcome. The natural gas ring main line and the Mayo to Galway pipeline were well negotiated by the IFA.</P>
    <P>The same cannot be said about the negotiations regarding the electricity supply infrastructure, as the ESB is now embarking on an investment of £2.1 billion to improve that infrastructure. There is a strong campaign in the western region to put electricity lines underground. People are of the view that ESB lines should be put along the perimeter of lands or even through forestry areas, if they have to be put up. It is strange that lines have to be put overground from Portumna to Cashla but can be put underground from Cashla to Galway city. Under the national development plan some £20 million has been earmarked to roll out the broadband to the regions. That is an important provision.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to provide funding for our airports. There is some debate as to whether Galway Airport should be relocated to Carnmore or Oranmore. Industrialists tell us they need an extra 100 metres of runway at Galway Airport to allow larger aeroplanes to use it. While that is important, the extra money for marketing received in Galway Airport and other regional airports has been welcome.</P>
    <P>I hope the third level education facilities in the region will be upgraded as has occurred in the NUI Galway and the Galway-Mayo institute. I hope there will be a continuation of the linkage between our university and institutes with other colleges in the region.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will continue the investment that has been made in the western region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion as, I am sure, does every Deputy from the BMW region because we are all anxious to see delivery on many of the promises in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>One must commend the Government on recognising that regional distribution of our economic progress has been uneven. This is reflected in the national development plan. More balanced regional development is a fundamental objective of the NDP. It is a very ambitious plan under which a sum of £40 billion, in 1999 prices, is to be invested during 2000 to 2006 across many sectors. I commend the Government on the proposals in the plan to continue sustainable national economic and employment growth; to consolidate and improve Ireland's international competitiveness; to foster balanced regional development; and to promote social inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard a good deal of talk during the debate about Objective One status, but the reality is that only one party at the time of the last election gave the electorate a commitment that it would seek Objective One status for the western region. Labour was against regionalisation, Fine Gael could not make up its mind at national level where it stood and some of their western <Col N="661" /> Deputies adopted a free for all approach to take whatever stance suited in their localities. It was the Fianna Fáil Deputies who gave a commitment to the electorate that they would seek Objective One status and that was fulfilled by the Government, and it must be commended for that.</P>
    <P>Within the BMW region, implementation of the national development plan is key. The importance of the infrastructural aspects of the plan over the next six years are vital because there is a chronic deficit in key infrastructure and at this point it is preventing the west from achieving its full potential. This cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>There is a need to keep up the momentum on delivery within the plan. A total of 18 billion is to be spent in the BMW region, but it is important that the delivery under that plan is seen to happen at a reasonable pace. We must overcome capacity constraints, especially for major projects. There is a need for institutional reform at local authority level. In our local authorities there is a serious problem of understaffing and no back-up facilities to put the national development plan in place. We are all aware of the problems experienced by our local authorities due to understaffing and the lack of back-up facilities in proceeding with any major project, whether a road design or rail service. There will be increased spending in the region, but that must relate to improvements on the ground. There is no point in talking in terms of billions of pounds, if people cannot see the progress taking place or if that progress has not been communicated to them properly. The benefits of the NDP are being communicated properly to the people and the perception is that it is moving at a slower pace than it should be.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for action on the employment side, particularly under the European employment strategy. I am talking about employability, skills shortages that people in the BMW region are experiencing, training and in-house training for employees, particularly in IT and digital skills. I am talking about equality and more opportunities and training for women workers and people returning to Ireland from abroad to work. There is also a need to look at job opportunities for all those who are willing and able to work. We heard in recent days about the record unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>In the BMW region, we are looking at unemployment figures of 4.8%. This is a huge reduction in unemployment and the massive job creation is a result of this Government's policies. People in this region are just as entitled to jobs as those along the eastern seaboard. I am referring to areas in north Mayo such as Belmullet where in the region of 200 jobs have been lost in recent years. That is the equivalent of thousands of jobs in Dublin, about which we would hear on a monthly basis if replacement jobs were not put in place. However, no real significant replacement industry has been put into north Mayo and this problem must be addressed. I am talking <Col N="662" /> about places such as Ballyhaunis, Ballinrobe, Ballina and Knock Airport. There should be a proper industrial base built around our regional and international airport to provide significant employment opportunities for people.</P>
    <P>We also need to promote active ageing and increased labour force participation because approximately 16% of the population in the BMW region is over the age of 65. Gone are the days when people aged 55 or 60 do not have something valuable to contribute to society. We are seeking 200,000 economic migrants to fill our job requirements over the next six years so why not dedicate some of the attention to the vast reservoir of experience and reliability among the active aged in the country? I am very concerned about the employment situation in some blackspots. While I recognise the efforts being made by the IDA, there is no point telling people in these blackspots that unemployment is at 4.8% in the region. They want money in their pockets and to be able to live day to day. That is something to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The national development plan has the potential to transform the economy of the western region and the quality of life of the citizens. It is needed because of the chronic underinvestment in infrastructure. As I already mentioned, it is an ambitious plan but it must be delivered on the ground if the credibility of the plan and the Objective One promises given to those in the BMW region are to be fulfilled. We must eliminate the infrastructure deficit by securing planning permission for projects. The current backlog must be eliminated and we must use private sector expertise if necessary. I am tired hearing from my local authority that it does not have sufficient planners or engineers and that when it tries to recruit these people the salaries it offers are not good enough. Let us use private sector expertise if required because the six year period is crucial. When we reach 2006, there will not be any point telling people we are sorry, that we did not get an opportunity to spend the money because we simply did not have the staff in place.</P>
    <P>We must use public private partnerships and match Exchequer and EU resources with well co-ordinated public private implementation. There is a need for better inter-regional dialogue. There is no conflict between the BMW region and the rest of the country. In the BMW region, we are just asking for that to which we are entitled. At the end of the day, if we get what we are entitled to under the plan, urban and social regeneration will be provided and there will be benefits to agriculture, tourism, fisheries and the environment. I mentioned earlier that 18 billion are to be allocated to the BMW region. We are getting 20% more <i>per capita</i> in the BMW region than in the rest of the country. That money is being well spent in the area of roads and water. I would like to make several points about airports, electricity and the provision of broadband.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from the west of Ireland, I am not satisfied with the condition of the N5 between <Col N="663" /> Dublin and Westport. It is a national disgrace that the road has been left in such a condition. While I accept that £2 billion will be spent on these roads over the next six years, a section of the road has been designated by the NRA not to be done until 2019, which is not acceptable. I ask for a front loading of funding for some of these major infrastructural projects.</P>
    <P>I will support the Government tonight because they are the only parties who have listened to the people of the west.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for sharing their time with me. I am pleased the motion is before the House and that I have a brief few minutes to contribute to it.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Opposition has a new found interest in the west which it says includes Donegal. The difficulty tonight is that the only person in the Chamber from outside the BMW region is the Acting Chairman. I presume that is because he is slotted for this time. The new found interest comes back to the same people who are plugging these interests all the time. It is heartening to know that nothing brings crocodile tears from people faster than political opportunism to which I will refer later. It is right that we talk tonight about locations such as Donegal. Three hours of debate on such a county is long overdue from those tabling the motion who usually do not think about it. If the record is checked, I will have managed to give three hours of my speaking time to the issue of Donegal, never mind the replies of Government Ministers. Therefore, to reduce all the issues concerned to a mere few minutes is very difficult.</P>
      <P>Donegal has not achieved what the rest of the country has as the statistics on job creation and unemployment will testify. As newspaper reports indicated yesterday, it is very frustrating to hear about the almost zero unemployment levels and the great employment opportunities throughout the country which have not yet reached Donegal. While our statistics are still fairly bleak and job creation is not what we would like, there are difficulties in terms of the right skills for the right jobs, right jobs for the right people, moving work to the workers and not the workers to the work. We complain constantly about traffic congestion in Dublin and the difficulty in obtaining accommodation, yet there are workers to do the work in Donegal but we cannot get the work, while the work is in Dublin where employers cannot get the workers. This issue should be easily solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of unemployment must continue to be addressed at a time when the economy is doing so well. Donegal has not yet got the road and rail access, high tech or other infrastructure which exists in other parts of the country. Those who know no better perceive the county as isolated. Yet that is so far from the truth for those who know and consider Donegal as part of the north-west region, close to Derry and Belfast. I can leave my house and be in Derry in 20 minutes <Col N="664" /> or in Belfast in just over an hour and a half. If I left here and tried to get to the airport on the other side of the city, it could take almost that amount of time, which speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Donegal's real problem is historic given its geographic location north of the North. Our problems of access, be it by road, rail or air, can only be solved logically through co-operation with the Six Counties. In regard to the N2, we welcome the by-passes from Monaghan, Carrickmacross and Castleblayney and the link to the M1. However, we want an M2 equivalent to motorways to Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Belfast. As I have raised this issue on many occasions, I await the Cabinet's conclusions on the national spatial strategy and look forward to the upgrading.</P>
    <P>The N2 is just half of my traditional route home, if Members pardon a certain amount of northern humour. The equally long A5 is in a different jurisdiction so we could only complain at cross-Border local authority level about the issue before the Good Friday Agreement. When we ask the Opposition tonight who brokered the Good Friday Agreement, I assume it will have to admit it was the current Taoiseach and the current Cabinet. Nothing has the potential to assist Donegal more than proper North-South relations. I trust the road and rail issues will be resolved at North-South ministerial level and I urge that the current political difficulties be faced up to and dealt with.</P>
    <P>In terms of air access, the Good Friday Agreement enabled the Government to seek and gain a PSO for the Derry-Dublin flight. I urge that the current political difficulties be faced up to and dealt with. In terms of air access, the Good Friday Agreement enabled this Government to seek and gain a PSO for the Derry-Dublin flight, investing in what has proven to be a very popular twice daily return service. I ask the Minister to bring to the attention of the Minister for Public Enterprise that there is a huge level of extra charges being levied on the Derry side. This must be reviewed as must the fact that the travel agents in Dublin add a £9 service charge to the ticket price.</P>
    <P>To assist tourism and trade it was our Government who, at my behest, contributed £4.5 million for the Greencastle-Magilligan car ferry which will be opened with its twin the Buncrana-Rathmullan ferry next Easter. Marketing can help overcome the damage done by 30 years of troubles. The all-Ireland tourism body will assist the Minister in her tourism organisation so I trust that the support for tourism initiatives will increase. Donegal North-East needs more power supply. The sensible resolution is to bring gas west from Belfast. Here again co-operation that will cross the Border at local authority level can be aided by a North-South dimension of the agreement. I ask that Ministers keep their focus on that matter.</P>
    <P>We needed broadband and fibre-optic investment and what did this Government do? It gave us £37 million but Eircom pulled out of the deal. <Col N="665" /> There must be a plan B. We lack housing and what did the Government do? They gave Donegal County Council £18.5 million. The challenge remains with the council, not with the Government, to deliver on housing. While fishermen previously pleaded with Fine Gael for its support, this Government delivered on the whitefish fleet renewal and marine infrastructural development and it continues to understand that this is an island nation with an important resource. The Government has kept the farming community in employment through its serious approach to foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <P>I return to the crocodile tears of tonight. How dare a party which refused to look for Objective One status for the west come in here to lecture Fianna Fáil&mdash;</P>

What did it do for its public representatives in Donegal North-East? Did these representatives get the ministerial ranks they deserved? Its public representatives here were ignored and the county was ignored when Fine Gael was in power.</P>
      <P>We need access, we need more jobs and we need investment. We need a national spatial strategy. I say no to those tabling the motion here tonight because I have seen where their true interest lies and their record on the Donegal and western region speaks for itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that it is not a personal remark. However, if the Deputy felt it was personal I must tell him why it might feel personal. The Rainbow Coalition during its time stopped the following projects in County Leitrim. It stopped the new county council offices and <Col N="666" /> stopped the north Leitrim regional water scheme. It gave only one small sewerage scheme, thankfully in my own village, during its time in power. It put no investment into the rail system, health, the telephone infrastructure or education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the change of Government in 1997 there has been sanction and construction of the new council offices. In fact they have been opened by the Minister who provided the money, Deputy Dempsey. Sanction of the north Leitrim regional water scheme has been given and it commenced this week. The new sewerage schemes for all villages in County Leitrim have been approved and consultants will be appointed this week by Leitrim County Council. A sum of £17 million has been invested in the Dublin-Sligo railway line which gives us continuous welded rail from Dublin to Sligo. During the lifetime of the Rainbow Coalition there was absolutely no investment in that line. There was just talk by Deputy Yates, the then Minister, who, when he was Opposition spokesman, sensed that the future of the line was in question. This Government has made the investment and now the line is a reality.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds mentioned health. When Deputy Cowen was Minister for Health he gave sanction for an extension to Our Lady's Hospital in Manorhamilton. He also sanctioned new health board offices for the North-Western Health Board in Manorhamilton. The extension of the fibre optic cable to the north-west was a decision taken by this Government.</P>

      <P>This is hurting big time because the Fine Gael Party never delivered as far as the west or Leitrim were concerned. This Government's interest in the Sligo Institute of Technology has been proved by the amount of money invested in it over the past few years. Its continued expansion is of major benefit when it comes to creating further employment in the north-west. The extension of the gas pipeline has been mentioned and it has been made clear that the Government intends to extend the pipeline from the Corrib field to Sligo and Donegal. This is important if we are to develop the region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that this Government has made enormous investment as far as the north-west and the BMW region are concerned. We are all aware that Fianna Fáil was the only party that put in its manifesto for the last general election that it wanted Objective One status for the west, north-west and Border counties. It proved successful and it is the lifeline and incentive people there needed. The greatest incentive that has been given as far as the area I represent is concerned was when the Minister for Finance introduced the Shannon corridor rural renewal scheme. It has made an enormous difference to the area I represent. Leitrim has benefited, and I make no apologies for this and I feel sure that Deputy Reynolds makes no apologies either. We also see the benefits of the MBNA project which will shortly open in Carrick-on-Shannon. It will provide between 300 and 400 jobs initially and it is estimated that it will provide up to 1,300 or 1,400 jobs over the next four to five years. These are Government commitments to develop County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>We have made enormous progress over the past four years. We have made progress with regard to education and the provision of new schools. Deputy Reynolds will probably be the first to accept that the recent announcement by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, of new second level schools for Mohill and Ballinamore is progress that was badly needed in the county.</P>
      <P>As far as the area that I represent is concerned, we have only made progress under a Fianna Fáil led Government. It is sad to have to say that and I know Deputy Reynolds accepts that we have made considerable progress. There are one or two other projects which need to be dealt with and I have no doubt that they will be dealt with in the context of the spatial strategy. One of those is the N4.</P>

      <P>I wish to compliment Deputy Reynolds for tabling this motion.</P>
      <P>Yesterday we had the publication of the quarterly national household survey which shows the national unemployment rate at an all time low of 3.7%. However, in the west it is several times that rate and in Donegal it is almost 20%, five or six times the national average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to last August's report of the Western Development Commission, the unemployment rate in County Donegal is 22%, which is a national disgrace. The national development plan will not bridge the yawning economic gap <Col N="668" /> between east and west but will allow greater divergence. The Government's stated policy of equal <i>per capita</i> spending between the BMW and southern and eastern regions will do more than preserve the unequal <i>status quo</i>.</P>
    <P>Figures from every single indicator, including population density, the dependency ratio, educational attainment, disposable income and family size, show the disparity of development between east and west. Graduate employment in the west and north-west is alarmingly low compared to other parts of the country and shows a huge brain drain from the west. Just 4% of graduates from Letterkenny Institute of Technology find suitable employment in Donegal. Major growth in economic activity and employment is needed to alter these alarming trends.</P>
    <P>One of the most important issues for economic development is access, but the north-west has been ignored in this area too. The major road arteries to Donegal and the north-west are the N2, N3 and N4. While the national development plan signals motorways and dual carriageways between Dublin and Belfast, Cork, Limerick and Galway, it states that roads to the north-west will be merely upgraded. Unfortunately, upgrading such roads will only allow for operating speeds of 80 kph, compared to 110 kph on motorways and dual carriageways. Journey times from Dublin to Donegal or Mayo will be no faster than they were in the 1980s, which means that potential investors will give a wide berth to these locations.</P>
    <P>The N2 from Donegal to Aughnacloy and the A5 on to Derry is the main artery between Donegal, Derry and Dublin. It is a scandal that both are not being upgraded to facilitate the increasing volume of traffic. It is a prime project for a joint venture between North and South. There are no railways in Donegal, but we have an international airport at Carrickfinn. While all other regional airports have several daily return flights to Dublin, it is unbelievable that there is no same-day return flight between Donegal and Dublin. It is similarly unbelievable that the Government tolerates such a situation.</P>
    <P>Donegal and the north-west continue to be under-resourced with gas, electricity and telecommunications. The region has a weak electricity infrastructure, with 110 kV lines covering the area compared to 220 kV and 400 kV in the rest of the State. This affects the quality of supply and means that there is a constant danger of variations. It can have catastrophic effects on industrial production. The telecommunication networks of the north-west and west have about 20 times' less capacity than the east and south, meaning that e-mailing a sensitive document can take several hours in Donegal compared to a few seconds in the rest of the country. Unless infrastructural deficiencies are recognised and rectified by the Government, the regional imbalance between the west and elsewhere will continue to grow.</P>

        <b>:</b> As a representative of a western constituency, born, living and working there, I found the amendment to this motion moved in the House yesterday by by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to be nauseating and insulting. Rather than addressing the serious economic and social deficits which starve the counties of the BMW region of vital and needed economic and social resuscitation, all we were given yesterday evening was the usual bureaucratic claptrap. We were given high-sounding nonsense: proposals, aspirations and promises from the national development plan.</P>
      <P>It got worse as I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy's speech and, quite honestly, I was appalled. Like many of us, he comes from and lives in the west and represents a western constituency with a large rural hinterland. He knows the reality of life in rural Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal, where villages and townlands disappear, rural post offices, shops and Garda stations close. The Minister of State nevertheless came in here yesterday evening prepared to read out a script written by a civil servant who probably comes in on the DART each morning with a briefcase, takes an elevator to his fifth floor office in comfortable surroundings and has a coffee break at noon. It is simply incredible that the Minister of State takes heed of a man who has probably never been to the west, let alone studied the problems there.</P>

        <b>:</b> The national development plan, which is being progressively implemented, is designed to enable economic and social development and balanced regional development. Let us look at figures from the most recent available IDA report, in 1999. In the north-west, which includes the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan's native Donegal, there were 5,556 jobs in IDA supported companies, compared to 6,093 in the midlands, 10,884 in the west and 57,955 in the east.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> That is the situation and the reality. In terms of jobs, the west is receiving the crumbs that fall from the rich man's table. We are supposed to be grateful for an odd announcement of 20 or 30 jobs. Page 19 of the IDA report is worth a look as it outlines the situation in the west and the midlands. In 1994, there were 116 IDA supported companies providing 13,000 jobs in the north-west, of which 1,558 jobs were new. There were 884 job losses that year, however, so for every two jobs gained, one was lost. In 1995, 1,300 new jobs were created but 697 jobs were lost. In 1996, 1,500 new jobs were created but 600 <Col N="670" /> were lost. In 1997, 2,082 new jobs were created but 900 were lost. In 1998, 1,600 new jobs were created but 800 were lost. In 1999, 1,290 jobs were created but there was a net job loss of 333.</P>
      <P>The motion itself is good, constructive and well-intentioned. The Government has tabled an amendment and expects rural Deputies from the BMW region to trot like aimless sheep to vote for it. I do not know how Deputies have the conscience do so and then return to their constituencies to justify their actions. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, mentioned energy, but we do not have energy in the west and as a result we have no industry. He spoke of the western road infrastructure, including the N2, N3, N4, N5 and N6. He should visit Castlebar to meet the commission examining roads in the west. He mentioned the western road network, but it takes four and a half hours to get to Westport from Dublin. One could go from Shannon Airport to New York in the same length of time.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion before us and I compliment Deputy Gerry Reynolds on it. When the Tánaiste was in China and Japan she said that Ireland has a First World economy and a Third World infrastructure. If the country as a whole has a Third World infrastructure, I do not know how the infrastructure of the west can be described. The lack of road access to the west is detrimental to industrial investment and the development of tourism in the west. The viability of existing industry there is damaged by the additional costs involved.</P>
      <P>The N5 is the worst national primary route in the country as it is like a cart track. The Cabinet had to travel over the cart track to get to Ballaghaderreen, but it wants to ignore it until 2019. We seek motorway status for the N4, as if motorways are being built all over the country, surely the N4 can be upgraded. The N61, the main artery from the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan's constituency in the north-west to Rosslare port is a glorified cart track. The N63, which is supposed to serve the new power station in Lanesborough is a substandard road. There has been no investment in the N63 and none is planned for 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our rail network is not being developed either, despite the fact that we have an ideal opportunity to develop commuter services. Athlone has four rail lines going into it, but none of them are used for a commuter service. A train passes through a couple of times in the morning and a couple of times in the evening. There is no commuter rail service into Galway, despite the fact that it is the <Col N="671" /> most rapidly expanding city in Europe. There is huge potential to develop the rail network for freight but it has been ignored so far. Much of the rolling stock that is used to bring people from the west to work in Dublin should be in a museum rather than on the rail lines of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government motion mentions gas. County Roscommon, which is in the middle of Ireland, has been ignored in terms of the gas network, as it has been ignored in the past. In the context of telecommunications, Éircom has ignored the infrastructure and has not put fibre optic cable in place, even though it is a basic infrastructure for e-commerce. Eircom has withdrawn its investment and the Government is ignoring the issue. Even Deputy Keaveney criticised Eircom's decision. In relation to electricity, there is a completely substandard national grid throughout the rest of Ireland and poor generation capacity. If it is not currently a crisis, it will be throughout the country by the end of this year when there will not be any electricity. In terms of employment, Roscommon has lost jobs rather than gained any under this Government. Roscommon has the lowest level of participation in education.</P>
    <P>These issues have and continue to be ignored by the Government. It is not prepared to tackle the issues. All it is prepared to do is bury its head in the sand, throw a couple of million pounds in our direction and hope it will keep us quiet. I commend the motion to the House and hope the Government, in its fifth year in office, will listen and do something about it.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Reynolds on tabling this motion. If ever a Government should be awarded an Oscar for public relations it is this one, because of its supposed interest in and ingenuity in dealing with the west every single day since it took office, without any sign of worthwhile progress. It speaks always of what it will do, never about what it is doing or what is has done. There are no targets, only press releases, and I guarantee that many voters are standing in the wilderness, in the long grass, waiting for to get the Government on western development. Deputy Higgins was right when he said a while ago that we are losing jobs in some counties. That is happening in good times. What will happen when things settle down?</P>
      <P>Regardless of what Fianna Fáil says, we put a special effort into getting that status for the west and the other regions. We were told that it would result in great inward investment and job creation, but we have not got one job more than any other part of the country. Instead we are losing ground. Not a month has gone by in recent years that the Commission for the West, a statutory body, has not publicly stated that Government is not delivering. It is not Fine Gael, or Labour but the Commission for the West which is saying that, and it has the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can there be balanced industrial development across a region containing towns and vil<Col N="672" /> lages if the infrastructure is so poor that there is neither water nor sewerage services and the region is not even programmed to get them in the next ten, 15 or even 20 years? How can there be any sort of balanced regional development, given what is happening in Dublin? Another 100,000 people will come to Dublin. There is no organisation, no co-ordination. However, they will come and resources will have to be made available for those people because they will be <i>in situ</i>. They will have to be provided with schools and hospitals, with roads and other infrastructure, and they will get that infrastructure before areas that do not have as many people. The problem is that if the Government cannot control what is happening in the capital, the situation of regional development of the whole country will be made a great deal worse.</P>
    <P>The big roads are planned, but I do not know when they will be delivered. Roads to the west are to be welcomed, but what is needed is job creation. The town of Ballinasloe has lost a few factories, among them A. T. Cross, the best pen manufacturers in the world, the loss of which put 250 people out of jobs. There has not been a replacement industry. We have an industrial estate which is nicely landscaped, but with very little in it. If this Government delivers in the next year or two, which now looks unlikely, what we want is an anchor industry which will be able to provide the sort of jobs that will have drawing power in the area, similar to what happened in Ballinasloe 30 years ago when it got three factories in the same year. Since they have all left, it is difficult to convince the 6,000 people in Ballinasloe that they are living in good times. I assure the Government that at the next election, Fianna Fáil will have much to answer for in Ballinasloe and east Galway.</P>

      <P>The Sawdoctors sang about the N17 and the spin doctors talk about Government Ministers. Deputy Connaughton was right when he said the talk is all about what the Government intends to do. One thing that has been top of the charts on every local radio is that the jokes are over and the people are waiting. Fine Gael will move the writ for the by-election tomorrow. If the Government feels so confident and strong let us have a general election, and if we do there will be fewer Fianna Fáil Deputies coming back from the west because of the Government's performance in relation to infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Higgins talked about getting the crumbs from the table. In north Mayo we did not get crumbs, we got the mushrooms. I tabled a question to the Minister last week about the job creation efforts of Údarás. If the Údarás was working for Manchester United, or managing Meath or Donegal, it would be sacked. This is its <Col N="673" /> worst record. When there are thousands of jobs in the country it has had losses year in and year out, and the Minister and her predecessor stood over that. When the Minister meets the Údarás she will tell it what a wonderful job it is doing and give it more money for grants than it can hand out to its friends and relatives. If the Údarás wishes to sell land, it does not have to go through the proper procedure like everybody else. A member of the board can have it at a knockdown price. I will stand over that statement. It is wrong that that it should be allowed to happen, and I have three requests under the Freedom of Information Act in relation to it. The people of north Mayo are sick and tired of the same people being looked after all the time. The place dying in its feet. There are no jobs, no infrastructure, no water, no ESB. It is not right. I would not mind if there was no money and the Government could say it has not got the money. However, it has money. For the first time since the foundation of the State, the Government has money, but nothing is happening. The Minister and her colleagues will go down to the Údarás in their State cars, do a public relations job and tell the people what they intend to do, but they have not done anything. They have let the people down, and those people are waiting in the long grass for the Government. The Minister does not have the courage to take on the Údarás. She will go down and praise it at a time when she should sack the board and put in someone who can do the job. All I ask is that the people be given a chance. If they do not get the chance now, they will never get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, gave me the job of looking after a proposal for western development. The infrastructure was put in place for this. We wanted to see capital investment in the western counties that would attract a partnership between the private sector, the banks, and the local communities and also use EU funding. The EU was particularly interested in remote rural areas and supported substantial schemes. It is a pity that after four years, nothing has happened despite all of the good work and the provision of structures. The prevarication went on for a couple of years before the Department accepted that there was a special role in this area.</P>
      <P>Prior to the last Government leaving office, plans were made to go to each Department to examine all their western proposals. A lot of work had to be done on that. The current western development manager brought these plans to the Departments and included them in schemes later. However, he is still left stagnant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in relying on the theory that the economic tide will lift all boats. It has not worked. There is a need for a special injection of funds throughout the western development area, particularly on the seaboard side of each county from Kerry to Donegal where there has been <Col N="674" /> huge emigration. After four years one would have expected that some type of pilot project would have been started or that there would have been a huge capital investment whereby the Government could claim, in a blaze of glory, that it had started the renewal of the west. Unfortunately, that has not happened.</P>
    <P>I regret that the means provided by the previous Government were ignored for some time by the current Government. That was best illustrated by the haste with which the Taoiseach shifted the section looking after western development out of the Department of the Taoiseach. He could not persuade Deputy Dempsey to take it because Deputy Dempsey sent it to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. It was put on the back burner. That was the kick the west got from this Government and it has not yet recovered from it.</P>
    <P>I support my colleagues' call for greater initiative in this area. I regret that a party which championed the cause of the west at each election and boasted of what it did for small farmers in the west has been found wanting in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I was extremely disappointed and surprised by the personal attack of Deputy Ellis on my colleague, Deputy Gerry Reynolds, and his family. Deputy Ellis is the last person in this House who should question what the Reynolds family or any other family has done for this country. I still have many cases on my books in which major questions require answers by that Deputy.</P>
      <P>The same Deputy mentioned a number of things which a coalition involving Fine Gael had stopped in his constituency of Sligo-Leitrim. This Government, however, has much to answer for with regard to its record on County Monaghan. The maternity wing of Monaghan General Hospital has been closed down. I asked the Minister for Health and Children what he would do about the upgrading and restructuring of the rest of the hospital, which has been announced and planned for the last number of years. The reply I received was simple. It was that the development of Monaghan General Hospital is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board. That is not good enough.</P>
      <P>The Minister claims full responsibility for any good that is done when he visits an area but where there is a difficulty he puts it out to a separate Department. The swimming pool in Monaghan has been closed, as has St. Patrick's Agricultural College and Pattons Provender Mill. There is no gas in north Monaghan and certainly no fibre-optic cable. The recent report clearly shows that the Border counties have suffered most with regard to unemployment and continue to suffer. No new jobs have been created in County Monaghan for many years despite the peace process. The jobs in the county have been created by the local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main issue I wish to raise, however, is the N2 motorway from Dublin to Derry. It is the only <Col N="675" /> link we have to bring industry in and get goods and people out of the area. However, nothing has happened with the road from the Aclint bridge through to Derry city. That is a disgrace. We have heard of many promises but no action. There has been talk of this being a major project since the early 1980s. The Belfast to Galway road and the Sligo to Dundalk road are not even in the national plan even though the Belfast to Galway road goes through Armagh, Monaghan town, Clones and Cavan. It is the single most important road crossing the Border and should be eligible for development if the peace initiative is to mean anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not exaggerating when I say that this Government has been guilty of total neglect of the west. We have been too boastful as a nation about the benefits of the Celtic tiger, especially the distribution of those benefits. We have overstated our economic prosperity with regard to the distribution of that prosperity to all parts of the country, including the west.</P>
      <P>An audit should be carried out of the infrastructural deficit throughout the country, especially in the west, with regard to roads, particularly the national secondary roads which service most towns in the west, sanitary, health and education provision and the roll out of the broadband. The west has been neglected in these areas. The seaboard of the west of Ireland should be considered one area. There are already the examples of the Algarve in Portugal and the Riviera in France and Spain. The west of Ireland should be marketed as one area and Kerry should be seen as an integral part of the west. It shares the same problems, difficulties and deficits as the other western counties.</P>
      <P>When the Government goes to the polls it will get its answer from the people of the west. It is becoming increasingly difficult to attract industry to the west because of the lack of basic infrastructure. That is why counties such as Roscommon, Leitrim, Mayo, Clare, Kerry and others are finding it difficult to compete with eastern counties in attracting even small industries. That is likely to continue.</P>
      <P>There have been various reports in the past but they have obviously been ignored by this Government. Even the Leader programme, which benefits many western counties, is still languishing with the Commission. There appears to be no urgency to get it through. It has been there for almost a year and the Government is still answering the Commission's questions. If there were a real commitment to western and rural development, the Leader programme would have been in place by now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a timely motion. I am delighted our spokesman on western development is Deputy Gerry Reynolds, who is from the heart of Leitrim in the west of Ireland. He comes from a family that has made a greater contribution to the west and Leitrim than Deputy Ellis ever did. I agree <Col N="676" /> with Deputy Crawford that it was most unfortunate of Deputy Ellis to make a personal attack on Deputy Reynolds this evening.</P>

      <P>We are used to revisionism from the Fine Gael Party. It usually pertains to the early part of the last century, but it is even better at it with regard to the latter part of it. Deputy Connaughton, who spoke about how hard Fine Gael fought for the Objective One status for the BMW region, must not have listened to the contributions to that debate from some of his colleagues along the east coast who castigated Members on this side of the House for attempting to look for Objective One status for the west. While I can respect the fact that some of the Deputies who contributed to this debate have been very vocal about the west, anybody who looks at the record will see that the same cannot be said for the whole of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing the motion before us we can lose sight of two fundamental facts. First, the infrastructure investment programmes provided for in the national development plan and elaborated on in the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme and the two regional programmes are the largest ever undertaken in the State. Second, the investment programmes under the NDP will benefit all regions, including the western counties. Of the total expenditure of £40.5 billion in 1999 prices under the NDP, £13.3 billion or 33% will be invested in the BMW region, which has a population of 980,000 or 27% of the population. In his statement last night, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, gave details of the many sectors in which this investment is taking place. The Opposition's claim that there is a lack of investment in the seven western counties referred to, simply does not stand up to scrutiny. For example, in those counties the allocation for national roads has grown from £34 million in 1997 to £108 million in 2001, an increase of 151%. The expenditure on water and waste water services has grown from £30 million in 1997 to £87 million in 2001, an increase of 190%. The allocation for non-national roads has grown from £52 million in <Col N="677" /> 1997 to £82 million in 2001, an increase of 58%. The allocation for local authority housing has grown from £30 million in 1997 to £80 million in 2001, an increase of 165%.</P>
    <P>Regarding the national roads network, the plan provides for investment of £236 million in the N2 from Dublin to the Border in the direction of Derry, which includes 8.5 kilometres of dual-carriageway, although I should point out to Deputy Crawford that I am not responsible for that part of that road in Northern Ireland. Some £429 million is being spent on the N4, the Dublin-Sligo route, which includes 35 kilometres of motorway and 18 kilometres of dual-carriageway. Therefore despite the claims of the Opposition, good progress is being made in implementing the plan.</P>
    <P>While we have just completed one year of a seven-year programme, a number of projects are already completed, or are very substantially in progress, and many more are in planning. For example, the Clar-Barnesmore N15 road improvement project will be officially opened tomorrow and work is continuing on the N17 between Knock and Claremorris.</P>

      <P>The motion is a clear recognition of the reality of continued social and economic disadvantage in the west, disadvantage also suffered in the Border and midlands regions. This was confirmed in unemployment figures released only yesterday. While there was a welcome up-turn in employment across the 26 counties, the Border region, which contains a number of the counties in the motion, lags behind in terms of new jobs and has the highest rate of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Border region has an unemployment rate of 5.8%, compared to a State-wide average of 3.7%, a record low. I have emphasised many times during the life of this Dáil that the Government is failing to share the unprecedented wealth in the economy. It has not tackled the structural inequalities which divide the haves from the have nots and region from region. The failure of this Government and its predecessors to undertake and implement long-term progressive planning has led to gross regional imbalances which plague our economy with excessive development concentrated in the Dublin region while the Border, the midlands and the west struggle to catch up. It has led to a housing crisis in nearly all parts of the country but with a greater focus in Dublin where <Col N="680" /> the greater concentration has been, a waste management crisis and a chaotic transport system, because of the failure to look at the regional imbalances.</P>
    <P>With special reference to the west, I will raise what I regard as a disastrous failure dating back to 1992 and one that has profound consequences. It could emerge as one of the greatest scandals. I refer to the sweetheart deal enjoyed by the consortium currently exploiting the massive Corrib gas field off the coast of County Mayo. This gas field is a hugely valuable national resource but it has been virtually handed over to a private company. The deal with the Enterprise led consortium was done in 1992 and the Minister responsible was former Deputy Ray Burke. I call for an investigation into Ray Burke's role in negotiating the deal, enabling the consortium led by Enterprise to benefit from what is the lowest tax regime in Europe. My party, Sinn Féin, has consistently argued for the deal brokered by Ray Burke in 1992 to be renegotiated. The deal ensured that the consortium led by Enterprise has not had to pay one penny in royalties to the Government for the Corrib gas find and the consortium can write off exploration expenses against any tax payable. Income is taxed at 25%, the lowest rate for oil or gas exploration in Europe compared to the world average of 40%.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that Irish national resources have been sold off at a knock-down price particularly when we look at the region involved, the neglected western seaboard. That somebody with Ray Burke's track record was centrally involved in this deal must raise questions about the nature of the negotiation and its outcome. These matters need to be addressed and answered. SIPTU representatives who represent Irish oil workers have called for an inquiry and the Western Development Commission has questioned the Government's handling of this resource. The circumstances and details of the negotiation of these terms should be investigated and made public in the interests of transparency and so that the people can assess whether we have benefited, or will benefit, from the potential oil and gas bonanza in our coastal waters.</P>
    <P>In June, a US company is due to begin drilling for gas in the Border counties. It is exploring a huge area centred on Enniskillen, straddling the Border and known as the north-west carboniferous basin.</P>
    <P>I hope this potentially massive national and natural resource will not be squandered against the interests of the people as was the Corrib find as I have just outlined. I thank Deputy Belton for sharing his time.</P>

      <P>Before I reply to the Government amendment, I wish to register my surprise at the personal attack by Deputy Ellis on my family. My family has had the honour to represent the people of Sligo-Leitrim and Roscommon-Leitrim in this House since 1927 &ndash; my grandfather, my grandmother, my father and I have rep<Col N="681" /> resented those constituencies. I hope to continue to do so for some time. We were always seen as respectable, honourable people and I hope that is how the general public regard us.</P>
      <P>This Government amendment is a fiction and shows how out of touch it is with the neglect of the western region. The Minister with responsibility for western development, Deputy Ó Cuív, has not had the decency to come to the House and listen to this debate on western development. Deputy Ó Cuív was appointed to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development but he did not want to take responsibility for the Western Development Commission and he did not want to be seen as the saviour of the western region. He was brought kicking and screaming into the position and he now has to take responsibility for the development of the western region. I am surprised he did not come into the House and put the proposals that he and the Government wish to implement over the next few years.</P>
      <P>The Government has not put forward any proposal to deal with job creation in this debate. Over the past three years, only 10% of all jobs created in Ireland have come to the west and Galway city has 90% of that 10%. The Government has not given this House any outline of how it will turn that statistic around. Deputy Jacob, the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, spoke about infrastructure, particularly about gas infrastructure to the north-west. He stated that funding and the extension of the network raise competition and State aid questions, and these issues, together with the funding options, are currently being examined. This is the Minister who announced the extension of the gas pipeline from the Corrib field to Sligo, but his speech last night puts that gas pipeline in jeopardy. If State aid and competition questions are still being examined, it is another example of how this Government makes promises that it does not keep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> Proposals have not been made by any Minister speaking in this debate, to deal with the issue of e-commerce and bandwidth. Eircom has withdrawn from providing bandwidth infrastructure into the western region. I asked the Minister for Public Enterprise to ring-fence the money that the Government would give to Eircom to ensure that the money for bandwidth infrastructure would be still spent in the western region. Is the Minister aware that it costs more to send an e-mail from Dublin to Galway than it does from Dublin to London or New York? Is the Government aware that an e-mail sent from Dublin to Galway is slower than a fax message? The Government has failed to deal with many issues over its four years in office and it is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>No proposal has been made to front load capitalisation. There are six national primary routes into the west of Ireland and the route to Galway city will be the only one with a dual carriageway. The remainder will be single carriageway. There are no proposals to front load the money necessary to give better access to the western region. We want to develop industry and tourism in the west. Our greatest difficulty is access and nothing is being done urgently by the Government to improve it.   </P>
    <P>Funding must be provided for the extension of towns and villages and the provision of associated infrastructure such as water and sewerage schemes. This is a slow and painful process. The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, outlined expenditure on housing during last night's debate. Why is it that housing lists in local authorities in the western and BMW regions continue to increase? The Fine Gael Party looks forward to returning to Government. We will provide much needed funding for the development of the western region and we will be responsible for our actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Belton. I hope the Minister listened carefully to what I said before Private Members' Business. Many of my colleagues agree with what I said. The time has come when Members have to speak out. We have to stand up for ourselves and not be afraid to criticise the media. Deputy Belton said one time in the House that because of some of the things people say about politicians, privately and publicly, they should be charged under the Incitement to Hatred Act. What is said sometimes is outrageous. People talk about chief executives and the commision which is to be established under the Bill. I put a bet to the House and to the Minister that those who will administer that commission will have far more staff than a Deputy.</P>
      <P>I was elected in 1994. I came from the west where I ran an auctioneering business. I gave it up to enter politics full time because I love politics. In my office in 1994, I had a fax machine, a photocopier and a phone. When I was elected to this House, I had to share an office, there was a common fax machine for the entire floor and there was no photocopier. The general public think we have access to all the resources of the State. I have a criticism of the Minister and of previous Fine Gael Ministers. I have not had the honour of such rank yet, but I do not intend leaving this House until I have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to make that comment. When they go to their constituencies, there are three or four civil servants there before them to make sure that everything is done right and they do not get their shoes dirty. They lose all sense of dealing with the people that elected them.</P>
      <P>As backbenchers, we have been treated badly by all Governments and by all Ministers except one. I will give credit where it is due to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. He is the only Minister with the courage to deal with the issues. As a a member of the Committee on Members' interests I am aware that whenever we brought reasonable proposals before that Minister, he listened and was not afraid to make decisions in the best interests of the Members.</P>
      <P>In this Bill, we are going too far. If a politician takes £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000 from anybody that is corruption. It is against the law and that is not what they were elected for. If they take such money they are compromised and they should not be Ministers or even Members of this House.</P>
      <P>When I was elected in 1994 my campaign fund was less than £8,000 and I can prove that because I had to go to the bank to borrow it. At the last general election, I spent the same amount. I got elected and topped the poll in Mayo. Machines, money and posters are of no value. Politicians who do their work between elections and gain the respect and trust of the people will have no difficulty getting re-elected. People who have been given ministerial office and abused it have done this House and its Members a disservice.</P>
      <P>I made the point earlier about disclosure of interests. It is outrageous that I can go to my local pub and my barman and everybody there can tell me what I own. What purpose does that serve? We do not know what they have. I do not know what the people in the Press Gallery own and I do not care. Why should my family have to be put through the mill? We should not be afraid to change that. It is outrageous, degrading and wrong and the person who introduced this provision was not re-elected. There is nothing wrong with freedom of information but having to declare Members' interests, which the media can use as they want, is not right. I am saying to Fíanna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour that that should be changed immediately. Why should my private business be published in every national paper? When this happened the local paper ran a headline: &ldquo;This is what your five TDs have&rdquo;. What does it matter what I own and why should the Joe Soaps in the pub be laughing about what we own?</P>

      <P>I did top the poll and it did not matter what I had or did not have. What was important was what I could deliver for the people <Col N="686" /> I represent. Members should not be afraid to stand up and speak out. Let us get together and defend one another.</P>

      <P>I wish I could speak with the same confidence as Deputy Ring about heading the poll. I do not think anybody works as hard as he does and many Members listened carefully to what he said on this matter.</P>
      <P>In recent years the image of politics and politicians has taken a downward slide. Some of the fault lies with us as Deputies. We feel that we have to own up and expose everything. However, the people are still not happy. There are some who will always be suspicious. I totally agree with Deputy Ring in relation to having to disclose what we own. The journalists then pick that up and print it. There are people who, when they see something in print, wonder why it is there. This is bound to create some form of suspicion. There is an implication that, for example, a second property owned by a politician has been obtained by some other means.</P>
      <P>People in politics are prepared to work for other people and that is a noble calling. I have served the public for 22 years and I am proud to have done so. I do not feel guilty about what went on in the past and is being investigated now. I do not feel that all politicians are the same. I often hear the expression, this has hurt the body politic. What about all the politicians who are not involved in this? Do they not strengthen the body politic? These people serve the public.</P>
      <P>Admittedly we get our salaries and expenses. Expenses always seem to come under a cloud of suspicion. These are expenses incurred and there is nothing to be ashamed of. If I stay overnight in Dublin, I have to go to a hotel, which will not put me up for nothing. Driving up to Dublin, renting a constituency office, having phones, etc., are all necessary to serve the public. The public deserves to have access to its local TD.</P>
      <P>Much of the bad publicity that politicians receive is not justified. If in the morning it was announced that there would be no more elections, people might have respect for democracy and politicians. I have no discomfort with what went on in relation to certain people who were Members of this House. That is what they did, but not all politicians should be painted with the same brush.</P>
      <P>Political parties are not adequately funded. If a party employs 18 or 20 people, that requires substantial funds to pay them and to maintain offices. One hears reference to Fine Gael getting amounts of £10,000 or £50,000 or Fianna Fáil getting various amounts and there seems to be an inference that it goes into somebody's pocket. Perhaps politicians should be more active in presenting the facts on the cost of running a political party, formulating policy and getting a message across to the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Daly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring quite rightly referred to the dearth of resources available in this House. I understand our funding for staff is about 50% of the average for national parliaments in EU countries. Clearly, some sarcastic comments in the media do not stand up to real scrutiny. I disagree with comments that Ministers and Ministers of State are out of touch with reality. Without singling out any Ministers, my general experience over the past 20 years is that our Ministers are in touch with what is happening or, if not, they are quickly reminded at parliamentary party meetings.</P>
      <P>Abuse of information was also mentioned by Deputy Ring, with reference to the information which we, as public representatives, have to provide under various Acts. The provision of information is not the problem, but rather the abuse of such information by certain interests. Unfortunately, information presented in the proper manner does not grab headlines or sell newspapers.</P>
      <P>I share the view expressed by the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, that sound political and administrative institutions, supported and trusted by the people, are a hallmark of advanced society and are crucial ingredients for a successful economy. Confidence in all arms of government is essential, including confidence in politicians, civil servants and members of State bodies. This Bill relates to all those categories, not just politicians. Those of us in political life have a duty to set a high standard of conduct and to conform to that standard to maintain trust in our institutions. Any failure by politicians in that regard is liable to be reflected in the other areas concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to reinforce the integrity of our political system. In considering it, we need to take account of other major legislative measures of previous years. The Public Service Management Act, 1997, put in place a modern accountability framework for the Civil Service. The Freedom of Information Act was a whole new concept, to which Departments and semi-State bodies are only now becoming accustomed. The Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunity of Witnesses) Act, 1997, gave Oireachtas committees increased powers of investigation in areas of public concern. We have seen the work of the Committee of Public Accounts in the DIRT investigation. The work of the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees will be greatly assisted by the powers which have been given to them. The Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, provided mechanisms to deal with conflicts of interest in relation to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, Ministers and officials in the Civil Service and the wider public service. That Act established the independent Public Offices Commission and provided for a Select Committee on Members' Interests in the Dáil and Seanad to oversee its key provisions. It requires members of the Oireachtas, senior civil servants, <Col N="688" /> members of public bodies and senior executives of State bodies to disclose their personal interests, in order to provide transparency in decision making and accountability. While I appreciate Deputy Ring's comments on the obligation to make this information public, this is a requirement which now applies right across developed societies in the western world. I see no reason to restrict that process.</P>
    <P>The Standards in Public Office Bill builds on the foundations laid by the ethics Act and the Electoral Acts of 1997 and 1998. These tried to achieve fairness in the electoral process by limiting expenditure at elections and providing a system of recoupment of candidates' election expenses in certain circumstances. It is no harm to put a limit on expenditure. There has been woefully wasteful expenditure during election times. It is quite common to find substantial excess supplies of literature and posters left over at the end of election campaigns. In my constituency, my party spent £5,000 during the last general election and a similar amount in previous elections. I believe Fine Gael did not spend very much more in that constituency. There is no need for expenditure of £40,000 to £70,000 to get elected. The return will come to those who have worked consistently over the years.</P>
    <P>The Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, which is currently progressing through the system, is very important in this era of globalisation. It provides that Irish individuals who are involved in corrupt activities abroad will be liable to prosecution. That is a good development. The Whistleblowers Protection Bill of 1999 was introduced by Deputy Rabbitte on the Opposition side of the House and I understand the Government will bring forward some amendments to it. It is important to provide protection so that people can give information on wrongdoings of which they are aware, without suffering recriminations subsequently. A couple of years ago, Deputy Rabbitte, now in the Labour Party, introduced a Bill. His Leader, Deputy Quinn, was the Minister for Finance and a whistleblower's section in the Finance Bill was withdrawn. It is amazing how, when they cross the House, they change their views on such issues. I wonder why. We also have the Local Government Bill, 2000, which will introduce comprehensive ethics for local authority members and officials. This is important because there is so much room for strange carry on in local government. It helps to have such rules applying there.</P>
    <P>The Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, arises from the Government's action plan for the millennium and the work of the McCracken tribunal. It examined the Dunne's payments and considered that there was need for change and to update the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. It also introduced the idea of a tax clearance system applying to Members of the Dáil. This was taken into account by the Government who brought forward proposals in the blue book which was sent to three committees of the Houses, finance <Col N="689" /> and the public service, and Members interests of the Dáil and the Seanad. Cross party, non-partisan discussions took place and their reports were unanimous. The Minister took their views into account.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a new standards in public office commission with investigative powers. It is important that it can conduct investigations, not only review actions. The powers cover public servants and office holders. They can also receive complaints about the contravention of the ethics or Electoral Acts, which they can review and decide if there need be an investigation. This is proper because it has been proved in many areas that there are vexatious complaints. The commission must be able to decide which to investigate. The commission will be made up of a judge, or former judge, of the Supreme or High Court, and four <i>ex officio</i> members, the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Ombudsman. I welcome that the Minister took note of the committees' recommendation that a former Member of either House would also be on the commission, because he or she could provide a perspective and expertise from the inside and this might not be available to the other Members. Some might say that this would affect its independence but people from this House became judges or joined other eminent bodies and operated without being influenced by their life here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because in the long-term it will help to improve the standing not just the politicians but the system. It is needed because times have changed. Up to 20 or 30 years ago there was no openness and no accountability. There was no Freedom of Information Act and people did not know what was happening. Those days have gone and we must change with the times by bringing in codes of conduct and measures to help people to operate the system beneficially for our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for giving me the opportunity to comment on this important legislation. I was brought up in an environment where, in politics, it was taboo to have anything to do with money; it was not acceptable. In my involvement in politics, which has been for quite a while, there were always accusations that certain individuals would act on a person's behalf if paid. Over the years the community at large accepted that there was need for controls in this area. The citizens believe that corruption can be found if improper influences are brought to bear by people with money. This is said about politics and other areas, especially medicine. Only if one has the money, does one get the business done. That is why this legislation is important and we should have the fullest discussions about how it should be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Council of Europe, on whose parliamentary assembly I serve, there was discussion and preparation of documents on how this should be handled. A recommendation from the political affairs committee, which will come before the <Col N="690" /> assembly in June, states how the 43 member states should set down guidelines and legislation to deal with this issue. What is apparent from the discussion and dialogue between the member states, individuals and professionals who studied this area, is that there is no one ideal formula for tackling it. One may set down guidelines, rules and regulations, but intelligent people will find ways to circumvent them. We need to guard against the situation where foundations, at arm's length from the politicians as in the United States, raise substantial funding for individuals' campaigns. I am not sure if the legislation covers whether it would be possible to find ways to deal with foundations' funding individual candidates, thus giving them an advantage over those operating by the rules. This must be guarded against.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe recommendations acknowledge that there must be a balance between public and private funding. There must be rules on private donations, thresholds on election expenditure, as mentioned by Deputy Ahern, transparency in accounts, independent audit and meaningful sanctions for breaches of the regulations. The crucial matter, as recognised by Europe, is the balance between private and public funding. There cannot be excessive reliance on State funding because it would be detrimental to politics. Europe also recognises that citizens must be encouraged to participate in politics through the financing of parties as that is the only way to have a meaningful say in how the system works. They can have influence without being involved in corruption.</P>
    <P>What has been set down by the Council of Europe has been endorsed by the Venice Commission, which spent a great deal of time on it, and only in March of this year set down very detailed recommendations which have been forwarded to all the member states. Some fairly detailed discussion has also taken place in the European Commission which will go before the European Parliament. I am not enthusiastic about passing this legislation without the benefit of the discussion that has taken place in the Venice Commission and that which is taking place now in the European Union. We must remember that what we are talking about also involves Community elections. If we are to have common rules for member states, we should endeavour when preparing our legislation to set it down in a way in which we will have some measure of common regulations and procedures throughout the European Union and especially throughout Council of Europe member states so we can avoid the kind of corruption that has been mentioned and the instability it has created. Citizens and the Union generally are at this stage very conscious that there has been a great amount of corruption, that there is a need to stamp it out, that there is a need to restore confidence in the political system and in politicians and that there is a need to get further agreement from the public at large to contribute towards the funding and development of <Col N="691" /> political parties not only here, but through the European Union and the European Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak on this important legislation. Politics and politicians must be credible and clearly accountable. Politics is about honest public service. Everyone I have met since my election in 1997 is very much committed to that ideal, but the perception of politics has been very much tainted by the few. Civil servants, county councillors and others are totally committed to serve.</P>
      <P>The increasing pace of change requires people of the highest calibre and integrity in public life. I take note that the Government has created a statutory basis for the prevention and prosecution of corruption, which is very important. The provision for a special account for public representatives into which it will be an offence not to channel political donations is important.</P>
      <P>The area of political and corporate donations and of political funding was raised by other speakers. The time for getting money for election expenses has long gone. People are elected to do a job and they are well paid. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, recently brought in a fair package for Deputies and Senators. I would not encourage election candidates to accept funding for election expenses because it would affect the candidate no matter how small the political donation. A Deputy is here for four or five years and if, as a previous speaker said, that Deputy does the job well, he or she may be re-elected and the people will decide. One can be elected without accepting donations from anybody.</P>
      <P>Funding for political parties is a separate issue to funding of political candidates. We talk about ethics in public office. I refer to the price of democracy. There should be audited expenditure, which should be accounted for, and the State should pay the bulk of that. I accept it is paying a portion at the moment. Although there has not been agreement on banning corporate donations, given the allegations in regard to business, I would see very few business people coming forward with any money. Even though some gave donations for the right reasons in the past, such donations have been tainted and they have severe implications in that in the aftermath, people may feel donors have been placed in a privileged position.</P>
      <P>The introduction of legislation on a code of conduct to regulate lobbyists is very important because lobbying could be wide open to abuse as well. Legislation to protect whistleblowers is also very important. The continuation of the unprecedented overhaul of the regulatory framework of public life is very important and welcome. The ethics in public office legislation, the Freedom of Information Act, the local government Bill, the prevention of corruption Bill and the Standards in Public Office Bill are important. All the inquires are, regrettably, doing the body politic untold damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> The Standards in Public Office Bill provides for the establishment of a new standards in public office commission with wide powers in relation to complaints about acts or omissions by persons in public life. Such complaints would concern matters which would be inconsistent with the proper performance by persons of the functions of office concerned or with the maintenance of confidence in such performance by the public. That is only right. It is a great privilege to serve in public office. This legislation will establish a code of conduct. There has been a voluntary code of conduct since I came into the House and it is very much adhered to by everybody. That has to be recognised.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers have said, the Bill also provides for tax clearance requirements and a requirement to make a statutory declaration in relation to tax compliance for persons elected as Members of the Oireachtas or appointed as senior public servants. It is very important that people are tax compliant. It would be very hard to speak on someone else's behalf if one did not adhere to the rule of the law. That is particularly so in this House where laws are passed. It is very important that we are fully compliant with the high standards set.</P>
    <P>It has been mandatory for many years for people operating in business to have a tax clearance certificate and this is very important. For those who comply, it is like a clean bill of health and the system is very easy to regulate. Business has made very important reforms from which it has benefited. Unlike years ago, the Revenue Commissioners are seeing that people are working to get their affairs in order.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the streamlining of current requirements for declarations of interest and donations under the Electoral Act. It makes a number of technical amendments to the existing legislation. The declaration of interests and donations published recently was so small that it clearly indicated the level of donations that people are now giving. There is no hidden agenda here.</P>
    <P>Freedom of information is very important so that people can inquire. They are entitled to know about the spend for elections. A cheque book does not get a person elected to Leinster House, it is commitment to constituency and the work a person does. It is important that there is prudent management. A candidate can lose votes by being excessively extravagant, although it is important to have a certain profile. Naturally, those who have not been previously elected are under pressure to get their names known and that is quite understandable. However, management of spend is very important.</P>
    <P>The high standing of politics is vital to the quality of our democracy. Our country needs the energy and the idealism of the brightest and best of our young people. It is important we encourage people to become involved in politics. Young people at the beginning of the last century carved out Ireland's place in the world and established <Col N="693" /> what is now one of the oldest democracies in Europe. It is important that ideal of the 20th century is brought forward in the 21st century and that people in office have a vision.</P>
    <P>Many people, particularly young people, are cynical about politicians. Many young people in college who are highly educated would say they would not vote. They nearly frown on politicians. It is not that one wants anyone to revere them, but politics must be seen as an honest profession and that we are here to serve the public.</P>
    <P>The issue of ethics in public office and the high standards expected from people in office should be included in the school curriculum. Civics has been brought back into the curriculum. The provisions of this legislation, when enacted, should be taught in our schools as it would help to make younger people more aware of the major opportunities offered by public office.</P>
    <P>This is a country of unprecedented opportunities. For the first time in our history we are a country at peace and the basic needs of all our people can be met. Legislation is enacted in our national Parliament. We must set out our stall and let people be in no doubt that candidates elected to public office are here because the electorate wanted them and that they are proud to represent those who elected them.</P>
    <P>I was not elected to a county council prior to being elected to Leinster House, although subsequently I have been elected to my local county council. Local authorities represent local government at local level. Their members do an outstanding job by representing every aspect of every county and parish and rural area.</P>
    <P>The Public Office Commission has drawn attention to a number of shortcomings in the legislation dealing with ethics in Government and in public life. It suggested remedial action should be taken by adhering to standards in public office with regard to gifts received. I am not sure how such gifts are valued. A politician can receive an expensive gift or a large financial donation from a friend and fail to record it as a political contribution without breaching the letter of the law. I am not sure who puts a value on such a gift whether a painting or something else. I have not availed of that opportunity. The giving of large gifts to politicians when opening a centre or some other facility can be overdone. Large expensive paintings given as gifts go way beyond&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is wonderful to be in politics in this time of prosperity. We are into the 21st century. I was elected to this House in 1997. The people I have met in all parties are of the the highest integrity. There has been self-regulatory reform here for a considerable period. I am delighted the Minister has introduced this legislation and that it will be enshrined in the Constitution, which is important.</P>
      <P>With regard to many people's apathy about voting and to the concerns about politics among the public, while many PR people work for the Government, we should do a PR exercise on the role of democracy here, what it has achieved and where this country can go. It could be kept apolitical. We must point out to young people that politics is a decent profession and try to attract people into political office. Many people are discouraged about the job.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have spoken on this Bill, although I did not have time to do much research on it. I look forward to representing the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim for many years to come. It is a wonderful honour. Politics is an honourable profession. Doing this job gives me immense satisfaction. We want to get that message out to people who are cynical about politics, but I believe they are cynical for the wrong reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill. Politics has gone through a very bad period in recent years. There is no point saying otherwise. Irrespective of how well meaning all of us may be, we are all tarred with the same brush. Those in this House who have dishonoured the profession will have a good deal to be accountable for in time. The rest of us have suffered in the eyes of the public and the cynicism emanating from young people, which almost every speaker mentioned, stems from people who abused the privilege of being politicians and used this House to benefit themselves and not to benefit the country. The founding fathers of this country would turn in their graves at the way some people have exploited the major sacrifices they made for this country not too long ago. People on all sides of this House made sacrifices. We descended from parties who made major contributions to this country. History will not be kind to those people who are appearing before tribunals or who have discredited politics in various ways over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to restore public confidence in politics. It is part of the process to put in place an effective regulatory framework for public affairs in this country. Too often in the past people came into politics for what they could make, not for what they could give. They were generally the exception, but they have tarnished politics and made it very difficult for the rest of us. In future politicians must be credible and clearly accountable. People who enter politics must be of the highest calibre and integrity. That is the bottom line. Gone are the days when <Col N="695" /> people could enter politics with a flawed pedigree, to borrow a phrase used some years ago. We have to be above reproach and totally accountable.</P>
    <P>I recently heard the Taoiseach say that politics is about public service, which is correct. It is a vocation. I recall when travelling to America in the 1980s to deal with the emigrant issue asking a former Minister, who came back as a Deputy, what motivated him and he said that politics was a vocation which was next to the priesthood. I would say that is the case for many Members. It is about more than that; it is about giving leadership and leading by example. We are all role models in various ways. We may not think it but every step a politician takes is watched and everything he or she says in public is listened to. The only time a politician hears about what he or she said is when he or she said something foolish at a public event and hears it back. People are listening to politicians all the time. Young people in particular are always looking for role models, whether footballers, teachers or politicians. When politicians misbehave, people get cynical about them, which is exactly what is happening in relation to young people at the moment. Young people never had it better, yet they were never more cynical.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State was replying, would it have been a good idea if he had included local authority members or could they be included in another capacity <i>vis-à-vis</i> the codes of conduct which apply to Ministers, other officeholders, Members of the Oireachtas and employees? I would like the Minister of State to clarify if other officeholders include local authority members. Should a candidate have a tax clearance certificate when they declare as a candidate rather than nine months later? Perhaps the Minister of State will reply to that question?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on its introduction. Unfortunately, we must react to the public perception of politicians. I am conscious of the contributions made by a number of Members this evening. I take the point made by Deputy Ring who suggested that on arrival to the House in the recent past, the facilities were so lacking that one would wonder how a Member could operate to any standard. I understand the point he made which I do not think takes away from the proposed legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies made the point that the public perception is very different. Unfortunately, the train of thought running through the debate has been to try to bring to the forefront the real issues affecting public representatives who try to <Col N="696" /> make representations with very little back-up, yet the public perception is the opposite. The case was also made that whatever structure is put in place to control legislation of this nature, the staffing levels assigned to that particular role will be far in excess of any staffing levels assigned to backbenchers or any Member of this House for research facilities. I can understand the concerns of Deputies in getting the message across that all is not what the public perceive it to be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly spoke about the road to Leinster House for many Members which is usually from the voluntary sector and with very little funding. Many Members have come to this House through the voluntary route, either by acting as local representatives or members of chambers of commerce and so on. It would be fair to say that very few people arrived here with a war chest of funding in order to set themselves to direct policy for their own benefit. If the media took an interest in this aspect, it would be clear that the vast majority of Members are here to serve the public interest. They certainly are not here to serve their own interest.</P>
    <P>Since I came to this House four years ago, I am amazed at the people who have come here from the professions, given what they left behind, not just by way of the substantial decrease in financial income, but by way of back-up facilities, the professional aspects and the pressures under which they must work. Last week there was the public declaration of Members' interests. The public would be wrong to think that this House is full of millionaires. People should be clear in their minds that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we must welcome the legislation because we must try to clear up the misconceptions that are out there. This is part of that process and another brick in the wall, so to speak. We have dealt with the issues of standards in public life, ethics in public office, freedom of information, public service management, increased powers of Oireachtas committees, prevention of corruption, the blue book, compellibility, privileges and immunity of witnesses and limits on election spending. I can understand why we had to deal with these issues because, unfortunately, in recent years Members of the House have breached the most basic regulations. I take the point that we have been self-regulatory but, unfortunately, breaches have occurred and the response from the public has been that every Member of the House is involved in this misbehaviour. We must now publicly and clearly define the parameters within the House and for that reason I can understand why the legislation is before us.</P>
    <P>The Standards in Public Office Bill seeks to ensure that those who seek office with the intention of serving their own as opposed to the public's interest will not find a safe sanctuary in this House. I support the point made by Deputy Deenihan. Standards in public office should apply to all public representatives. An issue that comes back to haunt public representatives in their clin<Col N="697" /> ics is the belief in the public's mind that it is easier to secure a favour if there is an inducement to the public representative. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Unfortunately, when one uses the old cliché that this applies to just a few, the public become even more cynical. I support the need to show the public that this requirement is not just confined to Members of the Oireachtas. Clearly every political party should take the lead and recognise that everyone who carries the banner for their own party should be clearly defined under the legislation.</P>
    <P>Tribunals established by the Houses of the Oireachtas have all too often heard from elected representatives words to the effect that that is how things were done in the old days, as if receiving large amounts of money, entertainment, and other gifts or donations were perfectly normal and above board and not worthy of a tribunal's time. If any member of the public is under the illusion that accepting gifts or inducements is acceptable, then they should take time to read the debates on the issues to which I referred. Unfortunately, very few people take the time to read this material and the public emphasis is usually on anyone who strays beyond these parameters. This debate clearly indicates that the old ways are not the best ways. Members of the House must always act with the utmost probity. There should be no place in either House for those who are not prepared to live by the rules and standards of the Oireachtas. Even though we keep repeating this fact, unfortunately, there needs to be more legislation to convince a cynical public that Members of this House are acting at all times in the best interests of the public and the House.</P>
    <P>The passing of this Bill will mean a raft of legislation to guide us in relation to what is right, moral and acceptable for public representatives. I accept that we must be ever vigilant against corruption and its insidious effects. It is often noted that corruption is hard hitting. I recently listened to a radio programme which referred to an undercover police operation in Jerusalem. That case concerned architects and builders paying bribes. This type of corrupt behaviour had devastating consequences as seen in the horrific accident last week at a family wedding. I am sure it is difficult for that family to distinguish between so-called low levels of corruption and high levels. It is particularly hard to explain the difference to bereaved families.</P>
    <P>The brutal murder of Veronica Guerin uncovered some startling information. Some gardaí had been compromised by criminals and some were working closely with criminals. I do not suggest that gardaí are corrupt. We have the highest regard for the members of the force. The point I make is that criminals will seek to corrupt and it is quite clear that they thrive on chaos. In the past some commentators argued that in the time leading up to Veronica's murder criminals were becoming increasingly convinced of their invincibility and the political system was their next target. What has been portrayed in recent <Col N="698" /> times is that their final target or sphere of influence was to be the legal process itself. The notion is not as far fetched as it might seem. Criminals in other countries have undermined governments and democracy for their own evil ends. The Freedom of Information Act is an effective tool for the press and citizens to guard against unacceptable practices. While none of us like the notion of the press breathing down our necks it is vital that every tool to ensure that wrongdoing can be uncovered is made available.</P>
    <P>I am sharing time with Deputy Roche.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very welcome. I particularly welcome it because I can claim a little part in its parentage. In 1994 a group of us from my party and the Labour Party were drawing up a joint programme. Ultimately it became the joint programme for three other parties.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a powerful instrument and a further block in the fortress against corruption. It makes a powerful statement about politics in this country. Politicians will not ever be role models but this Bill will challenge the cynics and weed out the crooked. Earlier today I was in the gallery with a group of young students from my constituency. They were very young but I was utterly dismayed by their cynicism. It was Question time and one youngster about 12 years old pointed to the Parliamentary Question folder and asked if it was one of the brown envelopes. I was very disappointed that that was all the child knew about politics. I hope things will improve as a result of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Politics should be a noble profession. It is about service to the public and representing the people. We are the messengers of the people to the national Legislature. At our level it is about making law, making Government behave, overseeing the system of public administration and overseeing the system of governance in the State. We are challenged in the Constitution with an awesome set of challenges. Bunreacht na hÉireann divests upon this House in particular all the major responsibilities that are vested on legislatures in all the parliamentary democracies in the world.</P>
      <P>A political body which has been corrupted cannot with any credibility fulfil the set of tasks given it by Bunreacht na hÉireann. Even if it is not corrupted, if corruption in its centre has given rise to such cynicism as we have in the nation at present, it finds it very difficult to fulfil its task with credibility. It would be very interesting to see how much time the cynics who oversee us from that bench give to this debate. It has been empty for some hours. It would be very interesting to see how much time is given to this debate on the national public broadcasting station or in the major broadsheets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is good and I commend <Col N="699" /> the Minister for introducing it, but I will point not to its strengths but to some of its weaknesses. The idea has been there for seven years and it is timely that it comes in now.</P>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments in section 2. The appointment process is marvellous. The idea that the chairperson of the committee should be appointed in a way which elevates the office of Chair is particularly good. However, why is it a former judge? We have many fine judges in the State and many find their way on to the bench but there are also many mediocrats on the bench and one or two that are downright bad. We always seem to call in the judges in these cases. I would prefer if the issue of chairmanship was open to a person of outstanding merit irrespective of where they came from.</P>
      <P>I am pleased, although it is not mentioned in the Bill, that people with parliamentary or political experience may be brought on to this commission. We have no reason to be always on our knees as a profession. The majority of politicians who have graced these benches and those of the other House and who have served this nation in every council chamber round the country have been good, conscientious public servants and they outweigh the small number who have been corrupt and have betrayed their public office.</P>
      <P>The second issue I mention is the question raised in section 4. A specific figure regarding benefits exceeding £10,000 is mentioned. It has often been said that everybody has a price. People can be bought, I fear, for less than £10,000. The threshold is rather high. People can misbehave without necessarily receiving a specific financial reward and some rethinking is necessary here. I accept the need to put some sort of figure.</P>
      <P>The issues in section 5 concern me. Section 5 deals with the roles and the power of the inquiry officer. It deals with the manner in which the inquiry officer shall seek statements from a complainant. The term &ldquo;statements&rdquo; is far too bland and neutral. It is important that when people make allegations of corruption they should be substantiated. There should be at least some clear <i>bona fide </i>evidence. A potential abuse that could arise from this Act is that we would have a situation where people could for example on the eve of an election make claims about a candidate which they know to be untrue. They could then leak the word to the local press or the national media that such and such a person is under investigation. We are then in the situation of &ldquo;no smoke without fire&rdquo;. A doubt has set in and a problem has been created. We all remember the late US President Johnson who famously said to some of his group &ldquo;Let us see the B****** deny this&rdquo;  when he was putting round allegations he knew to be untrue about an enemy. The necessity to provide some <i>prima facie</i> evidence of wrong doing is an issue that needs to be looked at and this area needs to be strengthened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue in section 7 I wish to raise is the man<Col N="700" /> ner in which the codes will be drawn up. It would be better if a neutral body, the commission itself, was to draw up the draft code. Then the various bodies could adopt those codes. That is not a major criticism.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important issue. In Ballyferriter there is a scandal involving three young boys who have Down's syndrome and who are being educated in a small and cramped office in the school. This is intolerable when one considers that our economy is supposed to be the envy of Europe. The lack of facilities at Ballyferriter national school to enable the boys, two six year olds and an eight year old, to access education is a damning indictment of our society, Government and economy.</P>
      <P>The room which has acted as a classroom for the boys for over a year is supposed to be an office for the school principal. It was never meant to be used full time but rather as a place where the principal could have meetings and work with a degree of privacy; it was certainly never designed as a classroom. Adequate space, facilities and a private room in which these children can avail of one to one attention from a speech therapist and whatever other services they require should be available. Such facilities are what children with special needs deserve as a right in a country which can afford to introduce special tax amnesty arrangements for offshore account holders.</P>
      <P>The conditions currently encountered by the boys are prehistoric and utterly unacceptable. The boys are unable to use adult toilet facilities and have their nappies changed on the toilet floor, which is humiliating. It is beyond comprehension that the request for additional facilities made by parents and children from the school have not been fulfilled. Ballyferriter national school has very basic requirements &ndash; an additional classroom, improved toilet facilities, a room for speech therapy, a library and a little playground. The demands are not exactly excessive; nonetheless they have been put on the long finger at the Department of Education and Science for too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The needs of those with disabilities do not make headlines, but the scandal at Ballyferriter national school should have the Administration reeling. The least that three young children should expect is maximum support and extra facilities to guarantee the best possible quality of life in later years. The State's denial of these facilities is beyond belief. The Government has made special appointments to oversee certain projects, specifically to the Bertie bowl, which <Col N="701" /> will have a limited impact on the well-being of the weakest in society. It is time we got our priorities right. Three young children are being denied the right to a decent education, a right which is a fundamental pillar of a developed society. They and their parents feel agitated and unhappy, but few would blame them as they deserve better.</P>
    <P>I have a ream of correspondence from the Department of Education and Science, a Department that cannot say when the facilities will be provided because of the volume of building projects under way. In this House tonight, I do not want to hear that recycled line as it is cold comfort to the children, their parents and teachers. I want to pay tribute to the children's parents and the teachers in Ballyferriter who work in terrible conditions to provide a wonderful education for the children.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding the provision of improved accommodation at Ballyferriter national school in County Kerry. At present, the school has a staffing level of one principal, three mainstream class teachers, one shared remedial teacher and one special additional assistant. The enrolment at 30 September 2000 was 81 pupils. An application has recently been received from the school for an additional classroom to cater for special needs pupils and appropriate additional ancillary accommodation.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science is currently assessing the long-term accommodation needs at Ballyferriter national school and when this process has been completed further consideration will be given to the application for additional accommodation. The Deputy will appreciate that given the large number of schools building projects being dealt with by the Department of Education and Science, it is not possible at this point to provide a timescale of when additional permanent accommodation will be provided at the school. I have listened carefully to the Deputy's comments regarding the special features of this case and I will bring them to the attention of Minister, Deputy Woods. I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to outline the position concerning the accommodation needs of Ballyferriter national school.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue and the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, for coming here at such a late hour. The crisis that the livestock industry has come through since BSE <Col N="702" /> closed most of our export markets was further compounded by the disaster of foot and mouth disease. The crisis is being exacerbated by the Government's failure to allow sufficient numbers of steers into the destruction scheme.</P>
      <P>In the last two weeks, records made available to me have shown that in the week ending 12 May only 3,320 steers were taken by meat factories and only 3,220 steers were taken the following week. A letter from the Taoiseach on 9 May to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine stated that the intake into the purchase for destruction scheme has decreased from 20,000 cattle per week to 10,000. This is due to commercial opportunities in Britain and the Netherlands as a consequence of foot and mouth disease. Up to 19 May, 97,000 fewer cattle had been slaughtered than during the same period in last year. Up to the same date, 185,000 fewer cattle had been exported live, so that by the end of this week there will have been a drop of 300,000 in cattle exports, whether live or dead.</P>
      <P>All cattle going to the United Kingdom have to be under 30 months old and only top quality heavy cattle are going to Holland. There is no market for most Friesian cattle over 30 months old. I understand that Lebanon is demanding cattle 24 months old or under and I would not be surprised if Egypt were to demand similar terms when it resumes imports from Ireland. Farmers all over the country are begging factories to take steers into the destruction scheme, but there is and has been a massive backlog. One local agent has about 120 steers belonging to about 20 farmers, but he can only get about ten cattle away per week for each of the next four weeks. Another agent has over 300 steers on his waiting list but is unable to offload more than 30 to 35 per week. If he can only dispose of 130 cattle during the next few weeks, where will the extra cattle find a market in a small area? </P>
      <P>Many farmers wanted to sell their cattle a long time ago but could not do so. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development promised 20,000 cattle per week would be included in this scheme up to the end of June. I do not like the scheme and many farmers hate the fact that having looked after and fed animals for up to three years, the cattle are now being destroyed. The scheme was introduced as an income supplement support. I believe that if 30,000 extra steers were taken into the scheme a serious problem would be removed and the present price of about 90p per pound would be maintained. If the price drops by 10p per pound after 1 July and stays low for the rest of the year, the nation will lose between £100 million and £150 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of a small farmer with 13 steers who has being trying since April to have the animals killed. Only this evening he was told by a major factory that it would not know until Friday whether it had a quota for the destruction scheme next week. This was the third factory he phoned today. He also contacted agents. I welcome the Minister's announcement that Spain, Italy, Russia <Col N="703" /> and the Lebanon are now open for business. Can he tell us when cattle can be moved and if and when the Egypt market will re-open? I and my Fine Gael colleagues encouraged and supported the Minister during the foot and mouth disease crisis. I beg him now to use the last four weeks of the destruction scheme to the best advantage and thus avoid a further crisis. The intervention price would be a disaster, and only cows are being allowed into the scheme after the end of June. Department officials have asked why farmers did not sell their cattle earlier. The records show that they tried but many had no choice but to hold them in order to utilise their grass because they were not allowed to buy other cattle. I urge the Minister to use the last four weeks to the benefit of all.</P>

      <P>The purchase for destruction scheme referred to by the Deputy was part of a package of measures adopted by the European Commission in late December 2000 in response to the substantial decline in consumption and the loss of major third country markets as a result of the confirmation of BSE cases in a number of EU member states. In particular, Commission Regulation 2777/2000 required member states to implement by 1 January 2001 a BSE testing programme for animals aged over 30 months destined for human consumption and a purchase for destruction scheme for animals aged over 30 months. The regulation also provided that the European Commission would refund 70% of the purchase price of cattle sold into the scheme, with member states carrying the balance plus the ancillary costs associated with the destruction of the entire carcase.</P>
      <P>The prices at which animals are purchased under the scheme are based on average market prices for the month of November 2000. However, in order to ensure that the scheme provided a more satisfactory floor price for beef producers in Ireland, the Minister took advantage of the option in the regulation to pay an additional 5% over and above these prices for steers and heifers.</P>
      <P>As far as implementation of the scheme in Ireland is concerned, slaughtering under the scheme commenced in early January and, to date, approximately 239,000 animals have been killed under the scheme at an estimated cost to the Exchequer of about £180 million. The application of the scheme has caused particular operational difficulties in Ireland due, for example, to the absence of incineration facilities for the disposal of the meat and bone meal produced under the scheme. Having regard to these difficulties, I have no doubt the Deputy appreciates the fine effort of the Government, notwithstanding other recent pressures, in ensuring that almost 50% of all purchases throughout the EU under the PFD scheme have occurred in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchase for destruction scheme has underpinned cattle prices in Ireland since the <Col N="704" /> beginning of the year at a significantly higher level than that provided by intervention. This is clearly evident from the fact that prices for young bulls in most member states have fallen on average by more than 20% since the BSE crisis of last autumn whereas steer prices in Ireland have remained relatively stable over the same period. The effect of the destruction scheme has been to overturn the traditional relativities between Irish and European prices. For example, last October, Irish steer prices were 86% of the EU average price for young bulls but are now 109% of average EU prices for this category. Therefore, the Government and, by extension, the taxpayers have more than played their part in supporting cattle prices.</P>
    <P>This is a complex scheme operationally and it is enormously expensive. It is incumbent on my Department to operate the scheme in a cost-effective manner, taking account of the level of cattle supplies and the needs of the market. As far as the market is concerned, the FMD in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands has reduced beef production in those countries and this has created additional market opportunities for Irish beef. Because of this, the industry succeeded in finding commercial markets for an average of 12,000 steers per week over the past month. With regard to supplies, we are now entering a period of seasonal decline in steer slaughterings. During the month of June last year, steer slaughtering averaged approximately 10,000 head per week, which is 16% less than the number of steers marketed commercially over the past month. I accept that a proportion of the June steer kill will be steers of more than 30 months, for which it will be difficult to find a market. However, based on the trend over the past month, the proportion should be relatively modest. Accommodating this number under the destruction scheme should not present any major difficulties. I am confident, therefore, that the PFD scheme and commercial markets should be able to absorb the likely supply of steers over the next month. The situation will be kept under review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is widespread concern in Munster and among disability organisations about the continuing delay in implementing agreed plans for a rehabilitation hospital for Munster. There is a very strong need to progress this project which enjoys widespread support, including in County Kerry. There are constant requests as to when this facility will open from people with disability, their families, carers and health care professionals. In view of the highly publicised waiting lists in acute hospitals, the lack of rehabilitation beds in Ireland and the very real needs of many <Col N="705" /> people with disability, there is grave concern that such a worthy and much needed project is unnecessarily delayed. The development of a comprehensive rehabilitation facility would be an important development for Munster, addressing a clearly identified need.</P>
    <P>Many people have to travel long distances to the country's only specialist rehabilitation hospital in Dún Laoghaire for treatment, and many more have to wait for very long periods due to long waiting lists. I urgently want to know when work can commence on the project, especially when at least three different announcements have appeared in the national press both from the Minister and the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach announced this project at the opening of the Jack Lynch Tunnel. As far back as 18 June 2000 the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> carried an article by Margo O'Connell, then political correspondent, which stated that Deputy Mícheál Martin, the Minister for Health and Children, was embarking on a £100 million plan for the development of hospital services in Cork, including the provision of a new rehabilitation unit for victims of stroke and serious accident.</P>
    <P>The article went on to state that the Minister claimed there was a need to develop medical rehabilitation services similar to those available in the National Rehabilitation Centre in Dún Laoghaire in Dublin and that he had asked the Southern Health Board to consider the development of a consultant-led medical rehabilitation service in Cork. In the <i>Irish Independent</i> in July 2000 it was stated that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, had intervened to end the row over control of the country's second £40 million rehabilitation hospital and that, under a proposal brokered by Deputy Martin, the NRB would run the new hospital while the Southern Health Board would handle all related acute rehabilitation cases at the existing St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital. This caused some consternation at the time.</P>
    <P>A report in <i>The Irish Examiner</i> on 16 February 2001 by Eoin English stated that rising costs delayed a decision on whether to locate a £40 million rehabilitation centre to serve the entire province of Munster in the mid Cork town of Ballincollig and that the proposed facilities, similar to the Central Rehabilitation Clinic in Dún Laoghaire, which would provide up to 350 jobs were earmarked for the site in Ballincollig. The report goes on to state that the Minister for Health and Children recently admitted in Cork that costs had soared way above initial estimates and that failure to agree had dogged the project so far. It stated that sources in Ballincollig had expressed amazement that at a time of record health spending the project had been delayed over cost concerns.</P>
    <P>The last item I saw on this matter was on Tuesday, 4 April, when Deputy Batt O'Keeffe made an announcement and the same journalist said it now looked certain that a £40 million rehabilitation hospital to care for people with chronic <Col N="706" /> brain and spinal injuries would be built in the centre of Ballincollig. The journalist said the newspaper had also learned that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, was to enter into direct discussions with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, with a view to securing funding for the project, which would provide 350 jobs in the mid-Cork town.</P>
    <P>Speaking in Cork last February, the Minister, Deputy Martin, said the decision on where to locate the rehabilitation hospital to serve the Munster region was delayed because costs associated with the project had soared. Ballincollig based Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, however, confirmed in April that the Minister had advised him that Cork County Council should proceed with the zoning of the land in the Army barracks for the rehabilitation hospital. This indication from the Minister, Deputy Martin, coupled with the news that he has taken up the issue of funding with the Minister for Finance seems to secure Ballincollig as the eventual location for the hospital.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister make a statement on when the hospital will get the go ahead and whether the money will be available for it? It is most important that it should proceed as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to set out the position on the proposed development of rehabilitation services in the Munster region. The Deputy should not believe everything he reads in the newspaper. The last few articles were news to me.</P>
      <P>The issue of rehabilitation services is a matter in the first instance for the health boards. I am aware that St. Mary's Hospital is the preferred site for the acute rehabilitation unit to serve the Cork and larger Munster region. A project team has been appointed for the development of St. Mary's Hospital and its brief includes the acute rehabilitation unit. It is estimated that the overall development at St. Mary's Hospital, when completed, will cost in excess of £25 million.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that this new consultant led medical rehabilitation unit will provide start up rehabilitative in-patient services for patients who require 24 hour medical observation. It is envisaged at this stage that the unit will contain 25 to 30 beds to complement the existing and future development of services planned for the hospital. The unit will provide a service similar to that currently provided at the National Rehabilitation Centre at Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Individuals with an acquired injury form part of a larger client group known as the young chronic sick. The need to provide rehabilitation services to deliver ongoing therapeutic programmes and to make the transition from hospital to the community for the young chronic sick on discharge from acute hospital care or medical rehabilitation has been identified as a priority service for development. For those individuals, for whom the severity of their condition <Col N="707" /> is such that they are unable to return to or remain at home, there is a need for the provision of appropriate residential care providing constant nursing care. Such specialised units would also provide respite care. Needless to say, because these conditions are generally acquired in adolescence or early adult years, significant psychological strain is placed on the family and the ongoing care and support required by the individual and his or her family needs to be addressed within the community support services.</P>
    <P>I have provided just over £92 million under the national development plan for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including the development of rehabilitation and long-term care service for people with acquired injury. Proposals for the development of a comprehensive rehabilitation centre in the Cork area which would provide both in-patients and out-patients rehabilitation programmes and services will be the subject of discussions between Rehab Care and the health boards in the Munster region. The aim is to provide a comprehensive leading edge rehabilitation service which will facilitate early intervention and a continuum of rehabilitation services from the acute medical phase through to the fullest restoration possible of independent living for the patient.</P>
    <P>The need for additional rehabilitation beds has been identified in the national review of bed capacity. This review is at an advanced stage and the findings will be brought to Government in the near future. I accept that there is a need to provide facilities which can meet the particular needs of patients requiring access to rehabilitation services. These include selected groups such as the young chronic sick and older people with specific conditions who require continuing care in a setting appropriate to their needs. The overriding objective will be to ensure that all individuals are treated in the most appropriate setting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue on the Adjournment. I commend the RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; team on a fine programme which was clearly in the public interest as well as in the interests of the relatives of the unfortunate victims, Sylvia Shields and Mary Callinan, and of Dean Lyons, against whom there was undoubtedly a serious miscarriage of justice. I also commend Jim Cusack, an investigative journalist with <i>The Irish Times</i>, who in a series of articles and radio interviews first drew attention to and pursued the serious issues involved in this case. Aspects of this case were previously raised in this House by various Members, including myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The brutal murders of Sylvia Shields and Mary Callinan in Grangegorman in March 1997 were probably the most horrific murders of recent <Col N="708" /> times. It would be hard to imagine two more vulnerable or defenceless victims than these unfortunate women. If for no other reason than the extreme callousness of the murder of these innocents, this case must be brought to finality, the person responsible prosecuted and justice done.</P>
    <P>However, other issues must also be resolved. Take the case of Dean Lyons who claimed to have carried out the murders. I hope the Minister will take responsibility for establishing the answers to the following questions. Did the statement of Dean Lyons contain information that was known only to the investigating gardaí and to the murderer, information that had not been referred to in media coverage of the crime? If his statement contained information which he did not have, is the only rational explanation that investigating gardaí suggested the details to him and effectively shaped his statement to a degree that made it possible to prosecute him for the crime? Is there some other explanation?</P>
    <P>Was this question addressed by the inquiry carried out by the assistant Garda commissioner? What were the findings and what recommendations were made arising from this inquiry? Why do these matters remain secret? Will the Minister request the Garda authorities to make the findings public? Why are we told by authoritative people that the detailed written statement of Dean Lyons is a precise, chronologically correct narrative about the murders in language beyond his ability and in contrast to the earlier &ndash; that same afternoon &ndash; confused incoherence of his first taped interview? Was Dean Lyons in fact suffering from heroin withdrawal symptoms when these statements were taken?</P>
    <P>I ask these questions in the context of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's reply to my parliamentary question on 3 April this year when he stated that the assistant commissioner's inquiry established that the treatment of persons in custody regulations were complied with in full in respect of Dean Lyons. If this is the case, those regulations need to be radically reviewed. Perhaps we need to go further and appoint an ombudsman to deal with such matters.</P>
    <P>The family of Dean Lyons deserves, at the least, a full apology from the Garda and a clear statement that he was innocent of this dreadful crime. What would have happened if Mark Nash had not murdered Carl and Catherine Doyle in County Roscommon on 15 August that same year and had he not then admitted to the gardaí that he had murdered the two women in Grangegorman? Would Dean Lyons have been found guilty of their murder? We must also ask if the type of Garda statement taking experienced by Dean Lyons is standard procedure. If this happened to Dean Lyons, has it happened to others? That question is now inescapable. Answers must be found to these questions.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of Mark Nash. He made <Col N="709" /> several statements of admission to the murders of Sylvia Shields and Mary Callinan. His statement, we are told, contained details about a third woman in the house in Grangegorman, about whom there was no previous public knowledge. However, he still has not been charged with their murder. This case demands that whoever was responsible must be brought to justice. A way must be found to ensure that this happens. The Director of Public Prosecutions must review his decision in the matter.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not see fit, given the importance of this case, to turn up in the Dáil this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the whole House will agree that this was an extraordinary case. It is, however, important to be clear about what happened.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, who cannot be in attendance here tonight, has been informed by the Garda authorities that soon after his arrest, Mr. Lyons made a full admission to investigating officers of his alleged guilt in the double murder, and that this confession was recorded on audio-video tape. Later on that same day, Mr. Lyons made a further detailed admission of his alleged involvement in the murders. This interview was not audio-visually recorded, at Mr. Lyons's request.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also been informed by the Garda authorities that the greater part of the detail in Mr Lyons's statements was general in nature, and within the public domain, as the murders had occurred more than four months previously. On the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the case against Mr. Lyons was dropped at Dublin District Court on 29 April 1998. No other person has been charged with this crime and the investigation remains open.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also been informed by the Garda authorities that the investigation carried out by an assistant commissioner indicated that Dean Lyons did not commit the murders. I understand that this officer has offered, through the Lyons's family solicitor, to meet the family to discuss the investigation. The gardaí had also been in frequent contact with the Lyons family, prior to his untimely death in the UK.</P>
      <P>The Minister has informed the House on previous occasions that the subsequent investigation by the assistant commissioner established that the interview in which Mr. Lyons claimed responsibility was carried out in accordance with regulations. Even so, he accepts that these events clearly have implications for the training of Garda interviewers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> I am therefore glad to report to the House that Garda authorities have informed the Minister that the relevant training is under way, with the implementation of a course on audio-visual investigation interviewing techniques. The course includes an overview of the available expert opinion and other relevant material designed to develop awareness when interviewing suspects with potential psychological vulnerabilities. The training emphasises the necessity for the investigating gardaí to alert the Director of Public Prosecutions to any known or perceived vulnerabilities when they submit the investigation file to that office.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, audio/video recording facilities are currently being installed at a total of approximately 150 Garda stations throughout the country. This has already been done at 12 locations to date and arrangements have been finalised for the supply of the equipment required for the other stations. I understand from the Garda authorities that they expect to have these facilities provided at all the relevant locations before the end of the year. I can assure this House that the Garda authorities and the other parties concerned are proceeding with the practical steps involved with the necessary speed.</P>
    <P>The other suspect whose name was mentioned in connection with the Grangegorman murders was arrested on 16 August 1997 in connection with a serious crime in County Roscommon. While in custody, he made a number of statements in relation to his alleged involvement in the murder of the two women, although I understand that he later retracted his statements of admission. The Garda Commissioner then directed that an investigation into this man's alleged involvement in the murders be carried out by an assistant commissioner.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been assured by the Garda authorities that the investigation which followed was a thorough one and that a complete file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for his consideration. The director decided that no prosecution should take place. As the House will appreciate, the director is independent in the discharge of his functions and is precluded from giving reasons for his decisions in any case other than to the investigating members of the Garda Síochána. It would not be proper for me to comment any further on the decision of the director, due to the independence of his office.</P>
    <P>I can fully understand the pain felt by the families of those who were killed at Grangegorman. No one has yet been tried for the murders, and this leaves many of their questions unanswered. I understand, however, that the assistant commissioner, who carried out the investigation and compiled the report, is willing to meet the victims' families and to discuss the contents of his report with them, should they wish to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government Bill, 2000, provides for the direct election by the people of the cathaoirleach of city and county councils from the next local elections in 2004 and to hold office for the same term as the council. The Bill is one element of a wide-ranging programme for the renewal of local government which has already delivered the following: constitutional recognition for local government with a fixed electoral cycle and guaranteed local elections; a proper funding system and increased resources by way of the local government fund along with a needs and resources model for the equitable allocation of funds; a lead role for local government through the county-city development boards in bringing together at local level the State <Col N="714" /> agencies, local development and social partners in planning for the future and to oversee an integrated strategy for economic, social and cultural development; measures to improve corporate planning, financial management systems, customer services, management structures, VFM and IT; and the establishment of strategic policy committees based on the partnership model to provide a full role for all elected members in policy development and with proper back-up and associated training-information programmes.</P>
      <P>The proposals for the elected cathaoirleach must be seen against this background. The cathaoirleach will head the corporate policy group comprised of the chairs of the SPCs as a kind of cabinet. As each elected member is represented on at least one SPC, and as the council is the ultimate decision-making body, members will have the opportunity to make their views known on policy matters at all stages. The cathaoirleach, council and executive will work together within this new framework and subject to necessary checks and balances. There will be scope for the elected cathaoirleach to adopt a proper leadership role and in conjunction with the CPG to provide a powerful impetus for change in the internal dynamics of local government, to oversee the executive arm and thus address the democratic deficit.</P>
      <P>A cathaoirleach who is directly answerable to the people and accountable to the elected council draws on powerful democratic legitimacy to speak and negotiate on behalf of the whole community, with influence well beyond any formal powers and with the capacity to bring together the various elements of local governance. The role envisaged is essentially a <i>de facto</i> role of community leadership based on democratic legitimacy coupled with the capability, credibility, motivational skills and commitment of the office holder. Experience elsewhere bears out the undoubted potential of such an office.</P>
      <P>The cathaoirleach will chair the county-city development board; in association with the CPG will have a key role in the preparation of the corporate plan for the life of the council and the annual budget, both of which must be prepared by the manager in consultation with the CPG; and together with a range of powers for the CPG and elected council to develop, make and steer policy and oversee the executive. At this stage an executive role is not proposed for the cathaoirleach and CPG but future development in this direction will be considered in the light of experience gained of the operation of the new arrangements now envisaged and of the developing programme of local government renewal.</P>

      <P>The number of houses completed or acquired by local authorities during 2000 was 3,207 units. While I was disappointed with this outcome, this was the first year of a four year multi-annual programme of 25,000 starts. I am also encouraged by the fact that at the end of 2000 over 5,000 local authority houses were under construction which was the highest level of end year work in progress for 15 years. This increased level of activity is borne out by the provisional output figures for the first quarter of 2001 which indicates that local authorities completed or acquired 800 houses, an increase of 150% on the corresponding figure for the first quarter of last year. I expect authorities to complete or acquire 5,000 housing units in 2001 and that new starts will exceed 7,000.</P>
      <P>With regard to the voluntary housing sector, 951 housing units were completed last year compared to 579 in 1999. I expect that over 1,200 units will be provided by the voluntary sector this year.</P>
      <P>The Government is addressing the increased need for local authority housing in every way possible including the introduction of multi-annual programming, sanctions for front loading of the programme, more streamlined procedures and greatly increased financial resources. This year capital funding for the local authority housing programme has been increased by 44% on the original provision for 2000 and by 150% on the 1997 provision.</P>
      <P>The local authority housing programme is only one of a range of ways in which the needs of households on local authority waiting lists may be met. I am confident that the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme, together with the increased output from the complimentary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of around 11,000 households to be met this year and that the increased social housing output over the next four years will meet the needs of over 50,000 households.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am aware of these figures which emerged from research <Col N="716" /> undertaken as part of the initial phase of the preparation of the national spatial strategy.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this research it was estimated that, in overall national terms, approximately one in three of our current housing build appears to be taking place largely in the form of one-off housing in rural areas. The figures referred to are estimates for 1999.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the farming community and those working on the land be able to live in the country. A continuation of the current trends in one-off housing, particularly with regard to urban generated development, that is development by those working in urban areas, will have significant implications in terms of a range of issues such as transport, the need to strengthen many of our towns and villages and the protection of ground and surface waters. The report entitled Sustainable Development &ndash; A Strategy for Ireland indicates that in general there should be a presumption against urban generated one-off rural housing adjacent to towns.</P>
      <P>The implications of the current trends in housing in rural areas will be taken into account in the preparation of the national spatial strategy in terms of addressing the sources of pressure for essentially urban generated housing. My Department is currently preparing a series of spatial policy indication papers setting out the possible choices and opportunities for promoting new patterns of development throughout Ireland over the next 20 years. These papers will be published in the second half of June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding the prescribed quality standards rests with sanitary authorities. Stringent drinking water standards are prescribed in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 81 of 1988). Article 4 of these regulations places a duty on sanitary authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure that water intended for human consumption meets these standards. This duty is performed under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency publishes a report annually on the quality of drinking water in Ireland and a copy of the report for 1999 is available in the Oireachtas Library. This confirms the fundamentally good quality of Irish drinking water but indicates that the greatest problems were the presence of coliforms in mainly poorly treated or <Col N="717" /> untreated private group and small private supplies</P>
      <P>The OECD Environmental Performance Review of Ireland, published in November 2000, correctly indicates that all water supplies do not fully comply with the stringent drinking water standards and that private group water supplies are the most problematic. The review report also acknowledges that measures have been put in place, particularly under the rural water programme, to rectify the deficiencies being experienced in these supplies.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of serious concern that any supply of drinking water is deficient in quality and, accordingly, the National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for large-scale investment in water services. The total provision of 3.8 billion investment under the plan will include a particular focus on: the provision of additional water treatment and distribution capacity; maintenance of water quality standards; water conservation and leakage reduction, and network rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>The rural water programme, addressing the needs of private supplies with water quality problems, will receive 533 million over the plan period.</P>
      <P>Several initiatives are in place to enable rural water problems to be tackled in a comprehensive and co-ordinated manner in partnership with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes. New technologies for water treatment have been successfully tested and will be given widespread application. The federation, with the backing of my Department, is introducing a quality assurance scheme for the group water sector. Following a pilot project on source monitoring in 1999-2000 a new national source monitoring programme commenced in July 2000 and will run for a 12 month period. The National Rural Water Monitoring Committee is in place to advise on policy in this sector. This committee is currently examining proposals for a pilot source protection scheme to commence later this year. I am satisfied that the all reasonable measures are being taken to rectify deficiencies in our water supplies as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The Dublin action plan on homelessness was launched by the Taoiseach on 2 May 2001. The plan is a culmination of effort by the Dublin local authorities, the Homeless Agency, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the voluntary sector and it charts a clear range of actions for tackling homelessness in the Dublin area over the next three years. I particularly welcome the publication of the comprehensive action plan and the Government will support its implementation by all of the agencies involved.</P>
      <P>The aim of the plan is that by 2010 long-term homelessness and the need for people to sleep rough in the streets will be eliminated in Dublin. Where homelessness does occur it is the aim of the action plan to ensure it will be short-term and all people who are homeless will be assisted into housing that is appropriate to their needs.</P>
      <P>The plan sets out a new integrated delivery system which will provide co-ordinated care for people who are homeless to assist them to progress into long-term housing. It will do this through a partnership approach so that agencies providing services for the homeless will work together under the leadership of the Homeless Agency to deliver better results.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic Bill, 2001, which was published on 28 March 2001, has the principal purpose of providing for the introduction of a penalty points system. I intend that this legislation will be enacted within the present year.</P>
      <P>In addition to new legislation, a number of other initiatives must be taken to facilitate the introduction and administration of a penalty points system.

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is primarily responsible for national policy and guidelines on tendering and contract award procedures in the public sector and for the implementation of EU public procurement directives.</P>
      <P>As regards local authorities and other agencies operating under the aegis of my Department, I can confirm that they have been directed to comply with the national guidelines on public procurement, 1994 edition, and the relevant EU directives. These guidelines and legislation are designed to ensure that the award of public contracts is transparent and fair. The award of public contracts is subject to scrutiny by local or national auditors as appropriate and, in the case of EU funded projects, by EU auditors. While unsuccessful bidders may occasionally be aggrieved by some aspect of the operation or outcome of the tendering process in particular cases, I am not aware of any general complaints from individuals or companies about the system of tendering and award of public contracts by the authorities or agencies concerned.</P>
      <P>So far as my Department is aware there have been no allegations of corruption in the award of contracts by local authorities or the other relevant agencies.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is making good progress on the preparation of the national spatial strategy. Following an initial round of public consultation last year my Department completed and published a report on the scope of the strategy, setting out the issues and challenges it needed to address and a work programme to ensure its delivery by the end of this year. This was followed by a period of extensive research during which a wide range of issues such as population and labour force projections, the future role of Dublin in Ireland and Europe, urban and rural functioning, factors driving the location of enterprise, quality of life issues, infrastructure and environmental protection were analysed and assessed.</P>
      <P>Based on the information which has been collected, my Department is preparing a series of spatial policy indication papers setting out the possible choices and opportunities for promoting new patterns of development throughout Ireland over the next 20 years to support the achievement of more balanced regional development through developing the potential of the country as a whole. The issues which these spatial policy indication papers will address will include the role of economic activity in progressing towards spatial balance; improving quality of life through spatial balance; sustainable development and spatial balance; the question of improving the spatial linkages, connections and co-operative arrangements with Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom and Europe and the implementation of the national spatial strategy.</P>
      <P>The policy papers will be published in the second half of June. Their publication will be followed by an intense period of consultation with regional and local interests, the social partners, sustainable development partners and other representative groups. Following that, and taking account of the responses and views received during the consultation phase, the proposals for inclusion in the strategy will be further developed with a view to having the strategy submitted to the Government for approval in late autumn and published by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 61, 89 and 192 together.</P>
      <P>The national climate change strategy which I published in November 2000, and which is available in the Oireachtas Library, sets out a ten year framework for achieving the necessary greenhouse gas emissions reductions to ensure that Ireland complies with the Kyoto Protocol. The strategy identifies a range of cross sectoral and sector specific measures to achieve the necessary reductions equitably, and with economic and environmental efficiency.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the strategy is being co-ordinated by a cross-departmental climate change team, chaired by my Department, which has met on seven occasions since January 2001.</P>
      <P>In addition to overseeing the successful implementation of the strategy, the team will also establish necessary consultative arrangements with the social partners, develop a robust and comprehensive set of indicators at a sectoral and national level, oversee the quantification of costs and benefits of the implementation of specific measures and undertake the biennial review of the strategy, beginning in 2002, in consultation with Comhar.</P>
      <P>A consultation process has been established to maintain appropriate liaison and information exchange with sectoral interests for purposes of implementation. Work is under way on the development of a long-term communications strategy addressing awareness of climate change and Comhar has prepared proposals for this. Sub-groups on inventory data, negotiated agreements with industry and economic analysis are also being established.</P>
      <P>Substantial measures identified in the strategy for their potential to contribute to greenhouse gas emissions limitation are under way at a sectoral level. They include a new renewable energy competition announced on 25 May 2001 and the recent granting of full market access to electricity from combined heat and power. Two new gas fired electricity generating plants will also be in place by 2002 using the most carbon efficient fuel which will be twice as efficient as existing plants. Substantial investment in public transport in the national development plan will reduce reliance on the private car, especially in Dublin. Necessary changes to the building regulations to reduce energy requirements are being accelerated to ensure full implementation well ahead of the 2005 date in the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While emissions of greenhouse gases are currently over 20% above 1990 levels, and on a business as usual basis with continuing economic growth are projected to rise by up to 37% above 1990 levels by 2010, the national climate change strategy is specifically designed to make the necessary reductions to move away from these business as usual projections over the coming decade. Sectoral measures included in the strategy are intended to reduce emissions by over 15 million tonnes COf7&gt;2 equivalent during the com<Col N="723" /> mitment period 2008 to 2012 per annum which will ensure that our target is met effectively and on time.</P>

      <P>As the recent annual report by the Ombudsman acknowledges, there has been a huge increase in planning applications in the past few years in line with the growth in the economy. Planning authorities have responded to this increase by improving their productivity enormously. This growth in applications has placed increasing demands on the officials and resources of planning authorities and, as the report highlighted, this has led to difficulties, in particular in relation to planning enforcement.</P>
      <P>I am strongly of the view that the introduction of a culture of enforcement is critical to ensure that the planning control system works properly and for the benefit of the whole community. I therefore brought forward simplified and strengthened provisions on enforcement in the Planning and Development Act, 2000. These changes should address some of the concerns of the Ombudsman, in particular the requirement on local authorities to keep complainants updated as enforcement actions proceed.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, was enacted on 28 August 2000. Because of the scale and complexity of the Act and the need to make regulations to give full effect to its provisions, it is necessary to commence the Act in stages. To date I have made three commencement orders bringing a number of parts of the Act into force. The commencement orders for the development control and enforcement provisions of the Act will be made in tandem with the necessary regulations, some of which will require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. Work on these regulations is now at an advanced stage and a draft will be submitted to the Oireachtas in the next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also acutely aware of the need to ensure adequate staffing levels of local authority planning departments. I and my Department have taken a variety of measures to address this issue. I have approved numerous requests from planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála for sanction for additional planning posts, both professional plan<Col N="724" /> ners and administrative staff, although I am aware that some authorities have experienced difficulties in recruiting to fill these additional posts. Nevertheless, staffing levels are increasing. The most recent survey by my Department of the larger local authority planning departments, that is county councils and county borough corporations, carried out on 31 January 2001, found that the overall level of serving staff, both administrative and professional, had increased to 1,090, which compared with a figure of 1,066 in October 2000, 994 in July 2000 and 895 in September 1999. I have also liaised with the Minister for Education and Science and the third level education sector on ways of producing more planners through the education system. In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, the employment of planners from abroad on fixed term contracts is being pursued.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's report acknowledged that these changes were being made and stated his intention to monitor the area closely over the coming year. In light of this and because I believe enforcement is best carried out at local level, I do not propose to establish a national planning inspectorate in relation to enforcement.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there are some recruitment and staff retention difficulties in parts of the fire service which militate against a full regime of fire prevention inspections. I arranged via the Fire Services Council to develop and run three special fire prevention courses for operational officers. These have been held in April-May and 60 officers are now available to fire authorities to deploy in the fire safety area. This further integration of operational and prevention activity is a welcome development. I have encouraged fire authorities to use the available resources in their fire safety activities and I am satisfied that they will do so.</P>
      <P>The issue of recruitment will also be considered as part of the wide-ranging strategic review of fire safety and fire services which I announced in January. Proposals from consultants to carry out the review are currently being evaluated. I expect to have the consultants in place by early June and the review finalised in the autumn. I will be looking to the review report to further inform my thinking and policies on this issue.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 63, 191, 197 and 200 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received copies of the EPA's Air Quality Monitoring Annual Report, 1999, and Indicators for Transport and the Environment in Ireland, both published in 2000 and copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. These confirm that while Ireland's air quality is generally good, the main challenges to maintaining and improving air quality arise from pollutants associated with vehicle emissions, notably <Col N="727" /> oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter. While Ireland continues to comply with all current air quality standards, other than marginally exceeding the 98 percentile of mean hourly values for the calendar year for nitrogen dioxide at College Green, the EPA's reports highlight the potential air quality impacts of increased traffic volumes. Accordingly, it is recognised that new EU limit values for particulate matter, PM10, applicable from 2005, and nitrogen oxides, applicable from 2010, will be challenging to meet, particularly in urban areas with heavy traffic.</P>
    <P>A number of policies and measures which will facilitate compliance with the new standards have already been implemented. These include the introduction of new fuel standards in 2000 and 2001, including cleaner diesel, a recognised source of PM10; improved emission standards for new vehicles; the introduction of the national car test; local traffic management measures, and significant investment in transport infrastructure such as the Luas. In addition, Ireland will again be participating in the European car free day on 22 September 2001 to encourage people to use sustainable modes of transport. This year my Department will also prepare a national strategy to reduce acidifying emissions, these are sulphur dioxide, SOf7&gt;2, nitrogen oxides, NOx, volatile organic compounds or VOCs and ammonia, NHf7&gt;3, from all sources by 2010 to achieve Ireland's commitment under the UN ECE Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground Level Ozone &ndash; Gothenburg Protocol.</P>
    <P>The EPA has recently completed a preliminary assessment of national air quality and the results will be published shortly. In addition, the agency published the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme &ndash; A Discussion Document in August 2000. I am committed to ensuring that, in addition to existing measures, any further measures that may be required will be put in place to comply with future air quality standards. In this regard, new standards in respect of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, lead and PM10 will be implemented as required this year.</P>
    <P>In regard to air quality monitoring and equipment, I refer to the reply to Question No. 263 of 22 May 2001. I have not given any specific instructions or policy directives regarding national air pollution monitoring. Any additional requirements will be addressed in light of the EPA's assessment referred to above.</P>

      <P>In recent years, there has been a visible increase in the number of people sleeping rough on the streets of Dublin and there are estimates that there are on average 200 rough sleepers in the city. The maximum number of rough sleepers encountered by a night-time bus service operated by Dublin Corporation since last Christmas to bring rough sleepers to hostels is significantly less than 200 per night.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently received a report from Dublin Corporation on the experience gained in the operation of the night-time bus service which indicates that there are a substantial number of persons who will not or cannot accept accommodation. Some choose not to accept offers of accommodation as they prefer the lifestyle of sleeping rough and there is a further group of people who cannot accept accommodation as they have been barred from the accommodation on offer. It is also the case that some of the people begging on the streets and apparently sleeping rough are not homeless.</P>
      <P>The extent of people sleeping rough will be further examined by the Homeless Agency. The Dublin action plan for tackling homelessness contains measures to address the needs of people sleeping rough in the streets through the provision of additional emergency places for rough sleepers and additional 24 hour drop-in centres in Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire. Dublin Corporation also intends to provide low threshold sheltered accommodation for persons with severe alcohol dependency problems, which should reduce the number of persons sleeping rough. In addition, it is also intended that day and night services will be improved, as will street outreach services as part of the plan.</P>

      <P>Powers available under existing legislation, in particular section 101D of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, are already being used by urban road authorities to regulate the opening of roads by utilities.

      <P>General guidance on the need for an efficient and expeditious approach to the carrying out of road works, whether by road authorities or other statutory undertakers, is also set out in my Department's memorandum on grants for non-national roads.</P>
      <P>A Communications (Regulation) Bill, which is currently being prepared by the Department of Public Enterprise, proposes, <i>inter alia</i>, to modernise legislation in relation to road openings by Telecom operators.

      <P>Local authorities and the National Roads Authority have been taking a number of significant measures to strengthen programme and project management in relation to the estimated £19 billion investment, current prices, in economic and social infrastructure mandated to them by the national development plan.</P>
      <P>Measures undertaken by the NRA include the development and implementation of revised management and reporting guidelines, including publication of the National Road Project Management Guidelines in March 2000 and the introduction of a project reporting computer system in early 2001; establishment in co-operation with local authorities of 11 regional design offices; greater use of consultants for detailed planning and design of individual projects allowing the staff of regional design offices to focus on project management and delivery; and greater use of public private partnerships.</P>
      <P>In relation to water services, my Department has introduced a three year water and sewerage investment programme for the period to 2002. This programme will be rolled forward on an annual basis throughout the NDP period and is intended to facilitate medium-term planning by all concerned, including local authorities and the construction and consultancy sector. To improve the efficiency of project procurement and operational management, my Department has also adopted a design-build-operate policy for water supply and waste water treatment in order to increase the involvement of specialist expertise in the process. My Department has also approved the appointment of dedicated project teams within local authorities to facilitate the efficient delivery of water and sewerage projects.</P>
      <P>In the housing sector, the introduction of the four year multi-annual programme of 25,000 house starts for the period 2000 to 2003 has given local authorities the flexibility to plan their housing programmes in a coherent manner in order to meet the housing needs of their areas. My Department also issued guidelines on the planning, design and implementation of housing projects in 1999. Individual project managers have been appointed in respect of redevelopment projects in Dublin and Cork. The Ballymun regeneration project is managed by a company set up specifically for the purpose by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> A variety of measures has been taken to address staff shortages in the local authority planning departments. In June 2000 I made planning regulations which increased the size of exempted domestic extensions from 23mf7&gt;2 to 40mf7&gt;2. This was designed to remove about 30% of planning applications for such extensions from the planning system in major urban areas to allow planners to concentrate on more complex applications and forward planning issues.</P>
    <P>From September 2000 new and expanded courses in UCD and Dublin Institute of Technology Bolton Street will treble the output of graduate planners in two years time to approximately 75 planners graduating per annum. In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, the employment of planners from abroad on fixed-term contracts is being pursued with assistance from the FÁS Jobs Ireland campaign. As a result of this, 27 qualified planners have already been placed on a panel from which planning positions in the local authorities and An Bord Pleanála can be filled on a contract basis. The Local Government Management Services Board is now managing this process and extending it to target other construction professionals such as engineers, architects and quantity surveyors.</P>

The litter subhead provision for 2001 is £950,000. The expenditure of £2 million included grants of £1.4 million to local authorities for local anti-litter initiatives to promote public education and awareness about litter; £260,000 for co-funding the An Taisce led national spring clean campaigns of 1999 and 2000; £220,000 to date for the development of a national litter pollution monitoring system to monitor and assess local authority litter management and enforcement action and to advise my Department on litter management planning at national level; £180,000 on various public awareness and advertising initiatives, development of anti-litter materials and leaflets, commissioning, printing and publication of national litter surveys, etc. and £18,500 in respect of the establishment and operation of the National Anti-Litter Forum.</P>

      <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority, NRA, under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993. Road authorities have similar powers in relation to the tolling of non-national roads.</P>
      <P>Under the Planning and Development Act, 2000, ministerial approval is no longer required for toll schemes, bye-laws and agreements. In accordance with the revised Part V of the Roads Act, 1993, these matters have been brought fully within the discretion of the National Roads Authority or the relevant local road authority in the case of national and non-national roads, respectively. NRA and local authorities are, however, required to engage in an extensive consultation process before adopting a toll scheme, which includes a requirement to hold an oral hearing into any objection to a proposed toll scheme. A comprehensive statutory public consultation process in relation to toll schemes is provided for in the Roads Act, 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Planning and Development Act, 2000, provides for the possibility of policy directives to the National Roads Authority or local authorities by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding the exercise of their road tolling functions. Any such policy directives may not relate to particular tolling schemes and must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. While no such directives have been issued to date, Chapter 4 of the NRA's <Col N="733" /> review 2000 and programme for 2001, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, sets out the key principles established by the NRA for its public private partnership, PPP, programme. I am satisfied that these principles, together with the broader policy framework set out in the NDP in relation to public private partnerships, establish a satisfactory framework for the continued development of the NRA's PPP programme.</P>
    <P>The Government has made clear in the national development plan its plans for considerably greater use of public private partnerships in the implementation of the current national roads programme. That approach is now being taken forward by the NRA. I am confident it will improve the efficiency and the speed of delivery of the national roads programme, while at the same time ensuring public accountability.</P>

      <P>A request from Wicklow County Council for special funding for flood damaged roads was received in my Department in February 2001. My Department has informed the council that funds allocated to local authorities for non-national roads are in principle designed to cover contingencies arising from severe weather conditions, but that the Department will be prepared to consider any request to adjust the council's multi-annual restoration programme to prioritise works necessitated by flood damage to particular roads. Wicklow County Council's non-national road grant allocation in 2001 is £7.107 million which represents a 25% increase <Col N="735" /> on the 2000 allocation and an increase of 102% compared to 1997. The council's 2001 discretionary maintenance and restoration maintenance grants of £396,000 and £815,000 are also substantially increased from £304,000 and £741,000 in 2000 &ndash; increases of 30% and 10%, respectively. I am satisfied that State grant funding of £7.107 million combined with Wicklow County Council's own resources of £1.963 million, provides appropriately for the council's ongoing non-national road requirements in 2001.</P>

The court decided that Ireland did not correctly transpose the directive in terms of the application of environmental impact assessment to afforestation and peat extraction.</P>
      <P>My Department has been leading negotiations with the European Commission for some time on the development of proposals to address the court ruling. These discussions have also involved the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, which has primary responsibility in relation to afforestation, and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, in relation to peat extraction on conservation sites. The negotiations with the Commission have been positive. In that context, the Commission has recently indicated that the strategy being pursued by Ireland appears to be capable of satisfying the court judgment. I hope to be able to announce the details of our proposals in the context of presenting the draft regulations on exempted development under the Planning and Development Act, 2000. I expect to present these to both Houses within the next month. On this basis, I am satisfied that a successful outcome to the negotiations will result in Ireland not being fined in this case.</P>

      <P>The number of houses completed and acquired by local authorities in the past four years was 3,217 in 1997, 3,290 in 1998, 3,713 in 1999 and 3,207 in 2000. I am encouraged by the fact that at the end of 2000 more than 5,000 local authority houses were under construction &ndash; the highest level for 15 years. This increased level of activity is borne out by the provisional completion figures for the first quarter of 2001 which indicates that local authorities completed or acquired almost 800 houses in the first three months of 2001, an increase of 150% on the corresponding figure for the first quarter of 2000. Based on this level of activity, I expect authorities to complete or acquire more than 5,000 houses in 2001 and start in excess of 7,000 houses. This is the highest level of activity for many years and evidence that the multi-annual programme approach is beginning to bear fruit.</P>
      <P>The results of the statutory assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 1999 indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. The previous statutory assessment of housing needs was undertaken at the end of March 1996 and indicated a total of 27,427 households in need of local authority housing. From ongoing contacts by my Department with local authorities it is estimated that needs increased by around 20% between March 1999 and March 2001. The next comprehensive statutory assessment of housing needs is due to be undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 2002.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully aware of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given by tackling this need. I have taken a range of measures to assist local authorities to expand their housing programmes and to expand overall social housing output. This has included the introduction of a four year multi-annual programme for the period 2000-03 to assist better forward planning by local authorities and to increase output. This programme provides for 25,000 local authority houses in this four year period. By way of contrast, in the early 1990s local authority housing output was averaging about 1,000 units per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatly increased targets under the multi-annual local authority housing programme together with the projected almost eightfold <Col N="740" /> increase in voluntary housing output under the national development plan is indicative of the Government's commitment to tackling social housing need in a way that is responsive to the volume and range of needs and to the necessity to secure quality social housing provision that contributes to social inclusion. Local authorities are aware that the provision of social and affordable housing is a major priority and that the necessary funding for their housing programme is in place. Capital funding for the provision of local authority housing in 2001 has increased by more than 44% on the provision in 2000 and by almost 150% since 1997. The multi-annual housing programme will be implemented successfully and the targeted output over the four year period of the programme will be successfully achieved.</P>
    <P>I presume the Deputy in referring to rental subsidy is seeking information on the number of households in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance rent supplementation. The scheme is operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. It is understood that there were 36,800 cases of rent supplementation in 1997 and there are currently 42,591 cases. While detailed figures would not be available, it is estimated that the majority of these cases would not, for various reasons, be seeking local authority housing.</P>

      <P>Dublin Corporation has submitted its housing programme for 2001 to my Department, which is to build or acquire 760 housing units as part of the multi-annual housing programme for the period 2000-03. Under the multi-annual programme, the corporation has been allocated 2,650 housing starts for the years 2000-03. The corporation's programme for 2001 includes the acquisition of 300 housing units and the construction of 460 housing units.</P>
      <P>In addition to the corporation's main local authority housing programme, there are major regeneration programmes under way in Dublin. There are almost 500 new houses currently under construction under the Ballymun regeneration project and it is expected that a further 400 will begin construction this year. There are also major regeneration schemes under way in a number of large flat complexes in Dublin's inner city involving a combination of demolition, refurbishment and new build. There are approximately 160 new houses under construction on five projects. While these measures are additional to the main local authority housing programme, they represent significant new and additional social housing activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 87 and 190 together.</P>
      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, was enacted on 28 August 2000. Because of the scale and complexity of the Act and the need to make regulations to give full effect to its provisions, it is necessary to commence the Act in stages. To date, I have made three commencement orders bringing a number of parts of the Act into force. These include many of the priority measures contained in the Act, such as Part II on development plans, Part V on the supply of housing, Part IX on strategic development zones, Part XIV on the acquisition of land, Part XX which amends the Roads Act, 1993, and, most recently, Part XVI on the licensing of outdoor events.</P>
      <P>The commencement orders for the development control provisions of the Act will be made in tandem with the necessary regulations, some of which will require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. I have also undertaken to bring a draft of these regulations before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Local Government for discussion prior to formally submitting them for approval. Work on these regulations is now at an advanced stage and I propose to submit a draft for approval within the next month, bringing into operation the following parts: Part I, which includes the exempted development provisions; Part III on control of development; Part IV in relation to architectural heritage; Part VI on An Bord Pleanála; Part VII regarding disclosure of interests; Part VIII on enforcement; Part X which covers environmental impact assessment; Part XI in relation to development by State and local authorities; Part XII on compensation; Part XIII on amenities; Part XVII dealing with financial provisions; Part XVIII which sets out several miscellaneous provisions and Part XIX which sets out the standard provisions relating to commencement, repeals and continuance.</P>
      <P>Following the implementation of these regulations, I intend to bring forward proposals later in the year for the implementation of the few remaining provisions of the Act, which include development on the foreshore and the control of quarries.</P>

      <P>The national development plan, NDP, provides for a total investment of £24 billion in infrastructure through the economic and social infrastructure. On a <i>per capita</i> basis, the investment involved will <Col N="743" /> amount to £7,658 in the BMW region and £6,566 in the southern and eastern region. This planned investment in infrastructure is the largest ever undertaken by the State and represents an average annual increase of 55% over 1999 levels; it demonstrates the Government's proactive approach and commitment to upgrading the country's infrastructure.</P>
      <P>A key objective of the NDP is to promote more balanced regional development. The accelerated infrastructure programmes of the NDP will address infrastructural deficits and bottlenecks throughout the country and provide the capacity for future growth. The national spatial strategy, to be finalised by end 2001, will address the promotion of more balanced regional development on a broader basis, with due regard to improving quality of life, maintaining and enhancing our natural and cultural heritage and sustaining economic development. Of particular importance among the issues which the strategy must address are identifying ways in which the potential of every region throughout the country can be developed; improving North-South co-ordination and co-operation on regional development and spatial planning issues; mechanisms for better integration of different sectoral policies; the role of energy and technology; urban growth patterns; the future of rural areas; linkages between urban and rural areas and the need for special policies on coastal zones and other high amenity areas. The spatial strategy will provide a framework within which future decisions on public investment, including investment in infrastructure, can be made in the context of the measures needed to achieve more balanced regional development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 96 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002, the first ever national road safety strategy to be adopted by an Irish Government, has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety, whose first progress report, July 1999, and second progress report, August 2000, detail progress with key actions. Copies of both reports have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library. The second progress report shows that real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the <Col N="746" /> Government strategy. Road deaths decreased by 59, or nearly 13%, between 1997 and 1999 relative to the strategy target of a 20% minimum reduction by 2002. Serious injuries decreased in the same period by over 15% relative to a similar reduction target of 20% by end 2002. The interim targets fixed by the strategy for achievement by 2000 have been well met. A third progress report will be published this summer.</P>
    <P>Progress is also ahead of target in extending low cost accident measures across the national road network, with 268 schemes completed by end 2000 and a further 88 approved. On the other hand, recent NRA surveys have shown that considerable improvement will be needed in order to achieve road safety targets for reducing speeding and increasing seat belt wearing. There was also a small increase in the number of road deaths in 2000 over 1999.</P>
    <P>Garda enforcement activity has been intensified and improved in accordance with the road safety strategy. More than 224,000 on the spot fines issued for speeding offences in 2000, compared to 175,000 in 1999 and 130,000 in 1998. Fixed speed cameras are in operation on four of the main national routes out of Dublin and on the M50. Speed limit enforcement is also being supported by an increase in mobile speed detection, the use of laser speed detection as well as in-car and motorcycle cameras. At the end of 2000, approximately 84,000 on the spot fines had been issued for non-wearing of seat belts since the introduction of this measure in July 1999. The number of detections for drink driving in 2000 increased by 24% over 1998. Evidential breath testing was ahead of target by end of 2000 with 25 instruments in operation.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy envisages a penalty points system in support of road safety enforcement. The legislation necessary for this measure was published in March 2001. My Department is also working to ensure the availability of a national driver file, complete with penalty points functionality, within the present year. Provisional Garda figures indicate that there were 415 road deaths in 2000. Provisional returns for this year show that in the first quarter 122 people were killed in road accidents, compared with 138 in the first quarter of 2000.</P>
    <P>Ensuring compliance with the targets of the road safety strategy will command the full effort and support of the Government and its agencies. By reference to the estimates set out in the strategy in 1998, more than 100 lives are now being saved each year as a result of implementing the strategy, compared to a continuation of trends prior to 1998.</P>

      <P>Ardmore sewerage scheme was approved for funding in the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002 under the rural towns and villages initiative. Waterford County Council has since proposed that the scheme be grouped with sewerage schemes for six other villages in County Waterford for procurement as a combined design/build/operate contract. I understand that the council expects to complete the preliminary report for the grouped project in July. On submission to my Department, the preliminary report will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied the existing range and level of non-national road grants, which are designed to supplement local authorities' own resources, provide appropriately for the ongoing needs of the non-national road network. State funding for non-national roads in 2001 is £323 million, which represents an 85% increase on the 1997 funding provision of £174.8 million.</P>
      <P>The restoration programme which has been in place since 1995 aims to restore all local and regional roads, which were deficient in 1995, by the end of 2005. This programme is undertaken on foot of multi-annual restoration programmes submitted by county councils. County councils have understandably accorded priority in the early years of the programme to regional roads and the more heavily trafficked local roads. In recognition, however, of the need for class III local roads to receive meaningful attention in the meantime, I have made a special allocation of £5 million in 1999 and again in 2000 to county councils for use on class III local roads only.</P>
      <P>Discretionary maintenance and restoration maintenance grants have also increased considerably in recent years. The discretionary maintenance grant has increased from £9.612 million in 1997 to £17.87 million in 2001, which is an increase of 86%. The increase in 2001 compared to 2000 was 30%. The restoration maintenance grant has increased from £23 million in 1997 to £36.74 million in 2001, which is an increase of 59%.</P>

      <P>The Joint Transportation Infrastructure Study referred to in the question, which was launched in February 1999, was commissioned by the Irish Central Cross Border Area Network, ICBAN, and the North West Region Cross Border Group, NWRCBG, with funding from INTERREG II. The study highlighted various deficiencies in transportation infrastructure on both sides of the Border and was taken into account in the formulation of the national development plan, NDP. The NDP provides for a total investment in the national road network of £4.7 billion, 1999 prices, over the period 2000-2006 and sets out a strategic framework for the improvement and maintenance of the network over that period.</P>
      <P>Significant investment in cross-Border national roads is envisaged, including those mentioned in the study  &ndash; for example, M1-N1, N2, N3, N15, N16. The NDP also provides for improvement works on national secondary routes in the Border area which are of particular importance for economic and regional development, including the N56. The NDP provides for £1.6 billion, 1999 prices, to be invested in non-national roads, of which in the order of £705 million is expected to be invested in the Border, midland and western region.</P>

      <Quest>the targets and timescale for the reduction of bio-degradable municipal waste going to landfill; the measures he intends to take to reach these targets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Council Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste provides that, not later than July 2003, member states must set up a national strategy for the reduction of biodegradable waste going to landfills. These strategies should include measures to achieve specified diversion targets, in particular by means of recycling, composting, biogas production or materials-energy recovery. Not later than July 2006, biodegradable municipal waste, MSW, quantities consigned to landfill must be reduced to 75% of the total amount by weight of biodegradable MSW produced in 1995. Further targets laid down for 2009 and 2016 in this regard are 50% and 35%, respectively.</P>
      <P>These targets were anticipated in the 1998 policy statement, Changing our Ways, which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable wastes consigned to landfill, and the development of composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum.</P>
      <P>The directive's targets have also informed the development by local authorities of local and regional waste management plans. Typically, these plans include proposals for household segregation and separate collection of organic and dry recyclable, including paper-card, wastes in urban areas; promotion of home composting, especially in rural areas; an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations; and a range of centralised composting and other biological treatment facilities for municipal organic and garden wastes.</P>
      <P>The plans will accordingly provide a basis for the proposed national strategy required under the landfill directive.</P>
      <P>The national development plan anticipates some £650 million of capital investment in waste management infrastructure. Of this, some £100 million in Exchequer and EU funding will be provided to support the development of requisite waste recovery infrastructure, including biological treatment facilities, over the life of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> I will shortly publish a policy statement on waste prevention and recovery. This will address in detail the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of policy objectives and targets in this area, and will outline the scope of measures which will be undertaken in support of a better national recycling performance.</P>

      <P>Decisions on the underwriting of insurance risks <Col N="753" /> and setting of premiums are matters for judgment by individual private insurance companies. It should be remembered that these are issues on which insurance companies make decisions and EU law prevents us from having any direct function in relation to them.</P>
      <P>Insurance companies are not required to seek approval from either this Department or Government for price increases. Prior approval or systematic notification of scales of premiums is prohibited by domestic insurance legislation, S.I. No. 359 of 1994, which gives effect to the Third Non-Life Insurance Framework Directive. That directive was adopted by the EU as part of the completion of the internal market.</P>

The Central Fisheries Board &ndash; CFB &ndash; is responsible for the day to day administration of the TAM. I am informed by the CFB that 20 projects were approved under TAM for the development of sea angling with a total project cost of £516,500, including European Regional Development Fund grant aid of £381,800. These developments included the provision of signposting and information countrywide.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, an amount of £400,000 was allocated from TAM to support overseas marketing for the angling product including sea angling. This marketing programme during 1999-2000 included production of brochures and posters on main products for coarse, game and sea angling in five different languages; journalist and trade visits programme; and advertising in the major markets of the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Marine Institute managed an EU-funded market research project to assess the potential for the Irish angling product in the British, French and German markets. The recommendations arising from this research will inform the development of future initiatives in this area.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 a total of £24 million is available for recreational and tourism angling in the Regional Operational Programmes. Under this angling measure funding will be available for projects which include the improvement of angling infrastructure, the development of the angling product and marketing support.</P>

    <P>One company operates ferry services from Irish ports using ships which are registered on the Irish Ship Register. The relevant details in relation to those vessels are set out below.

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the recent judgment of the European Court of Human Rights delivered on 10 May 2001 in the case of Cyprus v Turkey; the effect this decision will have on Ireland's relationship with the island of Cyprus; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The case relates to the situation in northern Cyprus since the invasion of that territory by Turkey in 1974 and the continuing division of the island of Cyprus. The issue at stake was the accountability of Turkey for violations of the European convention on Human Rights occurring in northern Cyprus. Cyprus contended that notwithstanding the establishment of the so-called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in November 1983, Turkey remained accountable under the convention on the grounds that the TRNC was an illegal entity and is not recognized by the international community. Turkey maintains that the TRNC is a democratic and constitutional state and is politically independent of all other states, including Turkey, and that allegations of human rights abuses made by Cyprus were imputable exclusively to the TRNC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> The application by Cyprus was lodged with the European Commission of Human Rights in 1994 and was declared admissible on 28 June 1996. In June 1999, the Commission reported that there was no basis on which a friendly settlement of the issues could be secured and referred the matter to the court in September 1999.</P>
    <P>In a judgment delivered at Strasbourg on 10 May 2001, the court held by 16 votes to one that the matters complained of by Cyprus in its application entailed Turkey's responsibility under the European Convention on Human Rights. In all the court held that there had been 14 violations of the convention. It should, however, be noted that the court decided unanimously that the question of the application of Article 41 of the convention which deals with the matter of just satisfaction was not ready for decision. Details of the very lengthy decision can be found on the court's internet website at http//www.echr.coe.int. I am arranging for a copy of the press release issued by the court summarising the judgment to be sent to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government with regard to the Cyprus problem is not affected by the decision of the court, which is binding on the parties concerned. Ireland recognises the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as the sole and legitimate government of the island of Cyprus. We believe this decision, which is consistent with previous decisions of the court in relation to the status of Cyprus, re-emphasises the need for a resolution of the problem of Cyprus. In this regard, Ireland supports the efforts of the UN Secretary General in the search for a political solution based on a bi-communal, bi-zonal and federal approach.</P>

      <P>My predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, announced on 8 January 1998 that the Government was examining how best to encourage and facilitate an understanding of the Battle of the Boyne and an appreciation of the environment in which it took place. In August 2000, the Office of Public Works on behalf of the Government purchased the Oldbridge Estate after receiving advice from military historians and the Orange Order on the matter. I am quite satisfied from that advice that the Oldbridge Estate contains the core of the battle site. Indeed, the archivist of the Orange Order has recently written to the Taoiseach expressing his appreciation of the resources committed by the Government and stated that &ldquo;undoubtedly this Estate encompasses the central portion of the battlefield&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In regard to the possible purchase of further lands connected with the battle site, this matter will be kept under review by the interdepartmental committee.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 117 to 121, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Irish National Petroleum Corporation operated the Whitegate Refinery with the benefit of a mandatory offtake regime at cost covering prices. This regime is being dismantled in the context of the sale of the assets of the company and this will result in economic savings of nearly £15 million per annum.</P>
      <P>While INPC disclosed modest surpluses in some recent years as shown in its consolidated published annual results, available in the Library &ndash; up to, and including, the 1999 accounts &ndash; it is doubtful if these can be regarded as profit in the true sense of the word. If the income from the mandatory regime is excluded the aggregate position is worse than break even. The results for 2000 are due to be published in about eight weeks. Its trading performance in the current year is much better than normal due to a combination of favourable circumstances.</P>
      <P>The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, is responsible for national strategic oil stocks. It negotiates storage contracts with a variety of companies, several of which are outside the country. In these circumstances, publication of storage rates is commercially sensitive for them. They are entering into arrangements with the new owners, as they had with INPC, and I am assured by the Chairman of NORA and by independent advisers that these arrangements are commercial for NORA.</P>
      <P>The main ingredient in the current liabilities of INPC relates to the syndicated loan to upgrade the refinery to meet modern environmental standards which stands at £70 million approximately.</P>
      <P>The position about environmental liabilities and about the business and assets is unchanged since I replied to Questions Nos. 138, 139, 140 and 141 on 22 May 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 to 125, inclusive, and 131 to 137, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> The procedures for the disposal off-site of all waste or left over material including belly grass from meat processing and all land spreading activities associated with such enterprises, must be undertaken in accordance with a specific nutrient management plan which is provided for under the terms of an integrated pollution control licence. These licences are issued and controlled by the Environmental Protection Agency and the disposal and treatment of all waste may only take place in accordance with the provisions of licences and with the agreement of the EPA.</P>
    <P>The disposal of material of animal origin would fall under swill controls administered by my Department. The Diseases of Animals (Feeding and Use of Swill) Orders, 1985, 1987 and 2001 provide for comprehensive controls on swill as a protective measure against the introduction or spread of disease. In particular, swill processing premises are required to be registered and hygiene and production standards for the transport and processing of swill are established. The feeding of raw swill or swill derived from aircraft, ships or offshore installations is prohibited. In addition, I made orders earlier this year in the context of the FMD situation, the effect of which are to prohibit the collection and feeding of specified material to animals. This ban encompasses the feeding of domestic, restaurant and other catering waste to all live animals.</P>
    <P>Swill includes any carcase &ndash; in this context carcase means the carcase of an animal or bird and includes meat, bones, hide, blood, skin, pelt, hair, fur, wool, feathers, hooves, horns offal or other part; any product derived therefrom or any hatchery waste or eggs or egg shells; any broken or waste foodstuff including table or kitchen refuse, scraps of waste whether or not such foodstuff contains, or has been in contact with, any carcase or part thereof; any waste product of the slaughtering or processing of any animal or poultry where such waste product is derived from such animal or poultry; any other thing, whether such thing has been heated or dried or otherwise treated, consisting of or containing any matter mentioned above; and any other material of animal or poultry origin.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the EPA that composting of animal derived material would not be permitted. Such material would have to be treated as swill, as mentioned previously, or disposed of by landfill as incineration is not yet an option.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that local authorities have instructions in relation to these matters as the delegated competent authorities in regions charged with waste disposal management.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on six cows under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme for small-scale milk suppliers. He declared that the total number of cows, both dairy and suckler, on his holding on the date of application was 17 and that he held a milk quota of 9,032 gallons.</P>
      <P>My Department's records show that he in fact held a milk quota of 11,532 gallons. Before determining his payment entitlement it was necessary to establish the notional dairy cows needed to produce the milk quota by dividing the milk quota of 11,532 gallons by 876 gallons as provided under clause 14 of the terms and conditions governing the scheme. This resulted in him requiring 13.16 dairy cows which my Department then subtracted from his total cows leaving a balance of 3.84 suckler cows payable under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme.</P>
      <P>If the person named considers that the record of his milk quota reflects incorrect details he should contact my Department as soon as possible and any new information provided by him will be examined as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as activities relating to the tourist industry form part of the services provided across a broad range of economic activities it would not be possible to separately identify the amounts of tax and PRSI paid in respect of tourism alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> However, the Central Statistics Office has provisionally estimated that the total international tourism and travel earnings to the economy in 2000 amounted to £2,901 million.</P>
    <P>Funds have been made available to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation to assist Bord Fáilte Éireann in an overseas marketing campaign in response to the difficulties experienced as a result of the foot and mouth crisis.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, acquired brain injury in young adults is most often sustained as a result of road traffic accident, sporting accident or fall. The degree of sustained disability is ultimately dictated by the location and severity of the injury to the brain and can range from being mild and, with the assistance of appropriate services, short-term to severe requiring ongoing support services or constant nursing care.</P>
      <P>Individuals with an acquired injury form part of a larger client group, known as the &ldquo;Young Chronic Sick&rdquo;. The need to provide step down rehabilitation services to deliver ongoing therapeutic programmes to the young chronic sick on discharge from acute hospital care or medical rehabilitation has been identified as a priority service for development. In the case of acquired brain injury, this service will provide the appropriate therapeutic programmes to enable those with cognitive impairment and psycho-social functioning problems, including the milder syndromes of inappropriate behaviours, to make the transition from hospital to the community. Needless to say, because these conditions are generally acquired in adolescence or early adult years, significant psychological strain is placed on the family and the ongoing care and support required by the individual and his or her family needs to be addressed within the community support services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those individuals, for whom the severity of their condition is such that they are unable to <Col N="768" /> return to or remain at home, there is a need for the provision of appropriate residential care, which has been identified as a requirement for specialised units, providing constant nursing care, for individuals with severe acquired brain injury. Such specialised units would also provide respite care.</P>
    <P>I have provided just over £92 million under the national development plan for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including the development of step down rehabilitation and long-term care service for people with acquired brain injury.</P>
    <P>In June 2000, I met Irish Neurological Alliance to discuss its report, Standards of Care for People with Disabling (Progressive and Static) Neurological Conditions in the Hospital and Community. The Irish Neurological Alliance is representative of a number of support groups, including Headway. Last year the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association made a submission to my Department which sought to increase the number of consultant neurologists in this country to meet an increasing demand from people presenting with neurological disorders. The report considered the need for further expansion nationwide, as the nature of neurological practice is changing with new effective complex therapies for many disorders becoming available. The challenge is to develop an integrated and co-ordinated health and social welfare system that is geared towards the needs of the individual.</P>
    <P>Comhairle Na nOspidéal is the statutory body whose main function is to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the Health Acts and to specify qualifications for such appointment. It also advises on matters relating to the organisation and operation of hospital services and publishes reports relating to services. Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups, I have requested Comhairle Na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues. The need for additional investment in neurological and neurosurgical services will be considered in the light of this review, other competing priorities and the availability of funding.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving an chomhairle's report in due course. The need for additional rehabilitation beds has been identified in the review of bed capacity. This review is at an advanced stage and the findings will be brought to Government in the near future. I accept that there is a need to provide facilities which can meet the needs of patients requiring access to rehabilitation services. These include selected groups with specific conditions, such as acquired brain injury, who require continuing care in a setting appropriate to their needs.</P>

      <P>As I previously stated to the House, I am most concerned at the deferral of chemotherapy treatment at the Mater Hospital. The patient in question was regrettably unable to be admitted to the Mater Hospital for chemotherapy on 17 April due to capacity problems, and was subsequently admitted on 26 April. This was unacceptable and obviously a cause of great concern to the patient and to myself.</P>
      <P>Following the receipt of Parliamentary Question No. 164 answered on 2 May 2001, my Department in accordance with standard practice requested the Eastern Regional Health Authority to make inquiries of the Mater Hospital in relation to the particular case. The authority advised my Department that it had contacted the Patient Service Office, Mater Hospital and was informed that the patient in question was due to be admitted to the Mater Hospital on 16 April 2001 and that at her request the admission date was deferred to Tuesday, 17 April. The parliamentary question was answered, in good faith, on the basis of this information received from the hospital <i>via</i> the authority.</P>
      <P>I understand now that the patient concerned did not refuse to be admitted to the Mater Hospital for her treatment. I wish to state that I accept totally the veracity of the statement made on behalf of the patient and I wish to apologise for any distress caused to the patient as a result of the reply given on 2 May 2001. This was certainly not intended and I will be conveying my apology in writing directly to the patient concerned. I am also happy to correct the record of the House in this regard.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I initiated a national review of bed capacity in both acute and non-acute sectors, on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The findings of this review will be brought to Government in the near future.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the provision of occupational therapy services in County Kildare rests in the first instance with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. I have asked the chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to examine the situation from the point of view of the matters contained in the Deputy's question and to prepare a report on those matters. Once this report has been received I will communicate with the Deputy direct.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the situation regarding staff shortages in the therapy professions. I have taken a number of steps to deal with the problem including the commissioning of a workforce planning study by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates, which will be published shortly, increasing the number of student places in the therapy schools, and implementing the recommendations of the expert group report on various health professions. As an interim measure, following discussions with the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, the number of training places for speech and language therapy was increased by eight, physiotherapy training places were increased by 52, and occupational therapy training places increased by five, from October 2000. Unfortunately, the capacity of the colleges does not allow for a greater expansion in the number of places for speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. However, I am confident that a substantial number of additional training places will be provided as a result of the study by Dr. Bacon. The pay and career structures for the therapy grades have been significantly enhanced as the result of the implementation of the expert group report, which should aid in the recruitment and retention of staff.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made with An tArd-Chláraitheoir and I understand that a death may only be registered in the district in which it occurred. The Births and Deaths Acts, 1863 to 1996, and in regulations made under those Acts set out the manner in which deaths must be registered. The person registering the death &ndash; the qualified informant &ndash; must produce to the registrar a medical certificate of cause of death signed by a registered medical practitioner who treated the deceased within 28 days before the death. The qualified informant signs the entry in the register of deaths.</P>
      <P>The list of qualified informants includes the nearest relatives of the deceased and if the death took place in a hospital the occupier of the hospital. Where the deceased has been attended in his or her last illness by a doctor, the person seeking to register the death must produce to the registrar a medical certificate of cause of death signed by a registered medical practitioner. Where the death has not been registered within 12 months of the death, the authority of An tArd Chláraitheoir must be obtained prior to the registration of the death.</P>

      <P>Some views have been put forward that cigarette vending machines should be banned or restricted.

    <P>About 15% of cigarette sales are made from vending machines. Many cigarette vending machines are located in areas in premises, often <Col N="774" /> out of sight of staff, where there is no form of supervision. This is unacceptable from a public health perspective. There is a need to control and restrict access to cigarette vending machines and ensure that they are suitably located on premises under direct supervision of staff.

This important document was prepared by the chief nursing officers of my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, in close consultation with senior nurses from all parts of the island who attended a series of workshops in Newry. The publication of the statement was co-funded by my Department.</P>
      <P>The statement is set within the context of European and Irish strategies for public health. It takes account of the World Health Organisation, WHO, Health 21 Targets for Health Policy in European Countries, as well as my Department's National Health Promotion Strategy, 2000-2005, and the Northern Ireland consultation paper &ldquo;Investing for Health&rdquo;. It was drawn up in response to the commitment by Ministers for Health in the European region of the WHO, contained in the Munich Declaration of June 2000, to enhance the roles of nurses and midwives in public health, health promotion and community development.</P>
      <P>I strongly endorse the vision of public health set out in the statement and would like to assure the Deputy that it will inform my approach to the preparation of the new health strategy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I launched the St. Vincent de Paul's report, <Col N="775" /> health inequalities and poverty, recently, I acknowledged the important role which the society has played in our society for many years in drawing to the attention of the public and the administrators and politicians some of the inequities which persist in our society. I welcome the report for its contribution to the complex area of health and social exclusion, an area that this Government has particularly focused on.</P>
      <P>As commented on by the society in its report, the 1999 annual report of the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children drew attention to the fact that &ldquo;inequalities in health status between socio-economic groups in this country have been demonstrated and are persisting&rdquo; and that the factors involved in the relationship between ill health and socio-economic background are complex and hard to unravel. However, we know that poverty can lead to ill health and in turn ill health can lead to poverty.</P>
      <P>In 1998 my Department commissioned the first national representative survey of lifestyle practices, the national health and lifestyle surveys, to provide baseline data to plan future interventions. This research reached similar conclusions as the health strategy. The data forms the basis of my Department's new Health Promotion Strategy, 2000 to 2005. This has specific strategic aims and objectives that will contribute to reducing health inequalities.</P>
      <P>Many of the causal factors of health inequalities, such as poverty and unemployment, are outside the direct control of the health services. Inter-sectoral collaboration is required to tackle these problems. The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion chaired by the Taoiseach includes Ministers from eight relevant Departments who meet regularly. Also, the National Anti Poverty Strategy, NAPS, interdepartmental group provides the principal strategic focus for the NAPS. This strategy was published in 1997 and set out a programme to reduce poverty and social exclusion both in general and in a number of key policy areas. Substantial progress has been made in achieving the original targets.</P>
      <P>As part of its commitment to tackling social exclusion, the Government gave a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to review the NAPS across all relevant Government Departments, and to develop NAPS targets in the health area with an associated monitoring and implementation framework. That exercise is now being carried out by the Institute of Public Health in consultation with the social partners under the auspices of a working group on NAPS and Health established by my Department. A final report is expected this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the assistance of the Institute of Public Health, the working group is trying to ensure that the consultation process is as inclusive as possible so that people who are poor or socially excluded have a genuine opportunity to tell us what they think would improve their health situation. To <Col N="776" /> avoid duplication, this consultation is being co-ordinated with that for the national health strategy, with the same liaison officers co-ordinating both processes at health board level. The results of the NAPS and health consultation will be one of the important elements feeding into the new national health strategy.</P>
    <P>The new national health strategy is now being prepared to address the major issues still facing the health system. Building on the previous strategy, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;, the new strategy will outline the proposed development in the health system for the next five to seven years in regard to improving our nation's health status. The overall objective of the strategy will be to provide a timely, safe and quality patient centred service on the basis of need.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that in keeping with the commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the health board chief executive officers are examining the operations of the medical card scheme in consultation with the social partners. Particular emphasis is being placed on the needs of families with children, and on removing anomalies and barriers to take-up, including information deficits. The review is expected to be completed mid year.</P>
    <P>A sustained and strategic programme of public investment coupled with appropriate and effective programmes of care are essential building blocks for a high quality health system. For this reason, the dual approach of significant funding backed by a series of reforming strategies has been the hallmark of this Government's commitment to the health services. The overall budget for health services for 2001 is now over £5 billion, representing a doubling of Exchequer input since 1997. On 1 January 2001 there were 1,560 consultant posts in the public sector in Ireland as compared to 1,292 posts in 1997, a net increase of 268 posts. There have been significant advances in many programmes. For example, last year over 70,000 more day cases and almost 12,500 more in-patient cases were dealt with in our hospitals than were dealt with in 1997. These 82,500 extra cases were dealt with as a result of increased funding and a series of effective initiatives in the health system. One of these initiatives is the successful recruitment of nurses both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>The additional number of nurses has contributed to the 65% improvement in the current total number of beds closed over the same time last year. At present, there are approximately 125 beds closed, most for refurbishment and some due to staffing shortages. Hospital waiting lists are dropping and the latest figures show that significant decreases have taken place in a number of target specialities. Since December 1999, the number of people waiting for cardiac surgery has dropped by 55%, gynaecology by 46%, orthopaedics by 29%, ophthalmology by 27%. In addition, it must be remembered that waiting lists only represent about 3% of total hospital activity.</P>
    <P>A further example of substantial investment is the allocation of over £60 million under the <Col N="777" /> national cancer strategy since 1997. In addition, significant increases in revenue funding for services for older people from £10 million in 1997 to £57.5 million in 2001 have resulted so far in approximately 880 new staff, 400 additional beds and 1,000 new day care places.</P>
    <P>In addition, a total of £2 billion was made available to the Department of Health and Children at the launch, in January 2000, of the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. The plan will bring positive benefits to all sections of the health services. It will, for example, enable substantial improvements in the physical infrastructure and equipping of acute hospitals, and in facilities for the intellectually and physically disabled, older persons, mental health and child care. The plan also provides for much needed investment in other areas such as new health centres and in the important area of information technology. The thrust of the plan is to create an infrastructure on a regional basis, that will bring significant advances in delivering a more patient-centred and accessible service.</P>
    <P>Much work has already been done in Ireland on a multi-sectoral approach to poverty and social inclusion. It is essential that we continue to build and improve on the framework in place in the context of revised NAPS targets, national development plan funding, and the commitments contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced in the provision of orthodontic services. These difficulties are being addressed and progress is <Col N="778" /> being made on a number of fronts in order to increase the numbers in treatment.</P>
    <P>Following recommendations in the Moran report, Review of Orthodontic Services, structural changes are being introduced in orthodontic services. One of the review group's recommendation was that appropriately trained, qualified and registered specialist orthodontists be employed in regional orthodontic units to ensure the continuation of a high quality service. An accord has been reached between the Dental Council, the two dental schools and hospitals in Dublin and Cork and the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry to establish specialist dental training in this country on a sound footing. The Dublin Dental Hospital, Trinity College and health boards have advertised a specialist training programme in orthodontics.</P>
    <P>The Dental Council has established a register of dental specialists with a division of orthodontics and the issue of a specialist grade in orthodontics within the health board service is currently being negotiated under the auspices of the Health Services Employer's Agency. I am confident that the setting up of a specialist register and the creation of the grade of specialist orthodontist in the health board service will result in a substantial improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of the orthodontic service.</P>
    <P>I have also approached the Dental Council concerning the creation of a scheme for the recognition of auxiliary dental workers in orthodontics &ndash; this grade will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling greater caseloads to be achieved.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. Additional funding of £5.3 million has been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private orthodontists to treat patients.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; ERHA &ndash; has appointed a second consultant orthodontist; the appointment of a third is expected in the near future and the recruitment of a fourth consultant orthodontist for the authority is under way.</P>
    <P>A new orthodontic unit at Loughlinstown is currently being equipped. An additional five surgery unit at St. James' Hospital is also being equipped. The Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital. The working group established in the ERHA to report on the implementation of the grant in-aid scheme in the Northern Area Health Board is currently continuing its work to finalise the scheme. The Southern Health Board is <Col N="779" /> developing new orthodontic units in Tralee and North Cork and is in the process of recruiting two additional consultant orthodontists.</P>
    <P>Based on the health boards own submissions, I expect that this initiative will have significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists and waiting times for treatment. The health boards have advised that the ultimate effect will be to increase the numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum and significantly reduce waiting times for treatment. Validation of existing waiting lists will be carried out.</P>
    <P>The outcome of this initiative in conjunction with the structural changes will be carefully monitored to assess the impact on waiting lists and to determine what further resources, if any, are required. It is not possible at present to put a time scale on this.</P>

      <P>It is the nature of health care systems that not all treatments can be made available to patients immediately because of the demands that arise in some specialities.</P>
      <P>There were more than 870,000 patients discharged by the hospital system in the year 2000. Waiting list numbers account for less than 4% of overall hospital discharges and the vast bulk of hospital work is carried out on patients who are waiting less than three months for inpatient or day case procedures.</P>
      <P>The waiting list initiative was introduced in June 1993 to address the issue of hospital waiting lists. Since then dedicated funding has been made available to health agencies to enable them to reduce waiting lists as much as possible and to bring waiting times to within reasonable limits.</P>
      <P>The overall target for waiting list initiative funding is to ensure that no adult waits longer than 12 months and that no child waits longer than six months for treatment.</P>
      <P>The overall hospital waiting list figure at the 31 December 2000 was 27,857. This figure represents a 25% drop on the figure at 31 December 1999. It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001 and I have made £34.5 million available to health agencies under the waiting list initiative this year. In the last three years alone this Government has made nearly £80 million available to health agencies to continue to reduce waiting lists and, very importantly, waiting times.</P>
      <P>A national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute settings is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. I presented the interim findings of the review to Government last year and identified a range of immediate investment proposals aimed at addressing identified difficulties. The bed capacity report is now at an advanced stage and the findings will be brought to Government in the near future.</P>

      <P>I have not been made aware that there has been an increase in the use of Rohypnol in date rape cases over the last two years. The Garda authorities have informed my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that there have been no sexual offences reported to the gardaí in which the use of Rohypnol has been detected. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been assured by the Garda authorities that they constantly monitor and analyse the incidence of drug misuse from the perspective of patterns and trends and that they remain vigilant with regard to the use of this particular drug.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rohypnol has been classified as a schedule 3 controlled drug in this country since 1993. The drug was reclassified in 1993 in response to reports of misuse and its rescheduling makes unauthorised possession an offence. The regulations also require that doctors prescribing Rohypnol abide by the special prescription writing requirements and Rohypnol should be stored in a controlled drugs cabinet in accordance with <Col N="782" /> the Safe Custody Regulations, 1982. Under the terms of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, I may issue a special direction prohibiting prescribing by practitioners or pharmacists convicted of offences under these Acts.</P>
    <P>Rohypnol may only be obtained on foot of a prescription from a medical practitioner and there is a need for a greater awareness among medical practitioners of the problems which can arise when Rohypnol or other controlled drugs are prescribed in an inappropriate fashion. My Department's chief medical officer has written various letters to general practitioners concerning the need to exercise caution when prescribing controlled drugs.</P>
    <P>The manufacturers of Rohypnol have also included a coloured dye in its formulation, so it is easier to detect if it is secretly administered to a person's drink.</P>
    <P>Rohypnol falls into the group of drugs know as benzodiazepines. I set up a committee last June, whose terms of reference are to examine the current prescribing and use of benzodiazepines, to consider recommendations on good prescribing and dispensing practice, paying particular attention to the management of drug misusers, and to make recommendations as appropriate. I expect this committee to report to me in the coming months.</P>

      <P>Discussions regarding the new taxi regime have taken place between my Department and taxi interests on some five occasions in 2001 to date. My Department remains accessible for further meetings, as necessary.</P>
      <P>I have indicated that it is intended to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, of disabled persons and of taxi service providers to develop further quality improvements for taxi services for the benefit of both the service providers and the general public alike in the medium term. My Department intends to finalise a consultation document in the near future and will invite comment on this from a range of stakeholders, including taxi service providers.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that there are approximately 900 bed spaces available for homeless persons in hostels in the Dublin city area and they are usually all occupied. In addition to the availability of hostel accommodation, bed and breakfast accommodation is also used to accommodate homeless people where necessary and there are currently over 1,350 bed spaces in use in bed and breakfast accommodation in the Dublin area. Figures for the rest of the country are unavailable at present but should become available as action plans for tackling homelessness are finalised.</P>
      <P>Hostel accommodation, which is the main source of emergency accommodation for homeless persons, includes long-term, transitional or medium-term accommodation where, in many instances, people can remain during the day and avail of meals and laundry facilities. Over-night emergency accommodation is usually vacated every day, although in some cases the same persons might come back nightly.</P>
      <P>With regard to emergency bed and breakfast accommodation, a rationalisation of the existing facilities is being carried out by Dublin Corporation and I understand that at this point most private emergency accommodation allows residents remain in occupation 24 hours a day, if required. In all newly contracted accommodation, the corporation insists on free access for residents, 24 hour security, a high standard of accommodation, a limit on the number of bed spaces, good overall management and regular inspections by corporation staff.</P>
      <P>Information is not available in my Department on the number of homeless people accommodated in emergency accommodation on a weekly basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to HomeBond registrations. The most up to date information available from HomeBond, which is for the first four months of 2001, shows that there were 2,561 registrations in Dublin city and county compared to 3,475 for the same period in 2000. <Col N="785" /> However, registrations for the first half of 2000 were exceptionally high due to a change in HomeBond administrative procedures which took effect in January 2000 and led to the bringing forward of registrations in that period. Accordingly, a direct comparison of the 2001 and 2000 figures is somewhat misleading. By contrast, a comparison of the registrations in Dublin city and county for the first four months of 2001 &ndash; 2,561 &ndash; shows that they are at the same level as the equivalent period in 1999 &ndash; 2,563.</P>

    <P>The 2001 allocation of £8 million under the local improvement scheme &ndash; LIS &ndash; represents an increase of 33% on the 2000 allocation of £6 million and 167% on the 1997 allocation of £3 million. Sums of £3.948 million and £5 million, respectively, were allocated in 1998 and 1999. The considerable increased funding available in 2001 will enable county councils to make good progress in reducing the number of applications on hand. At the end of 2000 there were 4,651 applications on hand. The funds provided in 2000 enabled 913 schemes to be carried out of which 698 were fully completed and 215 partially completed.</P>

      <P>The standard speed limit for built-up urban areas is currently 30 miles per hour. However, there is a general obligation that a vehicle shall not be driven at a speed exceeding that which will enable its driver to bring it to a halt within the distance which the driver can see to be clear.</P>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, indicated that changes to speed limit regimes, which were comprehensively reviewed some years ago, were not proposed in the immediate term: the priority must instead be to secure a much higher level of compliance with existing speed limits.</P>
      <P>However, the option of revising speed limits downwards is not ruled out if enforcement of existing limits does not show good progress towards the strategy goal of reducing present excessive levels of speeding. Such downward revisions could address lower speed limits in built-up areas.</P>
      <P>I intend that the situation will continue to be monitored in line with the above approach.</P>

      <P>The pilot rural resettlement scheme provided for the building or acquisition of additional <Col N="796" /> local authority houses which could be let to applicants who are on rural resettlement Ireland's waiting list and who wished to transfer from an urban to a rural area. Since the inception of the scheme in 1997 additional starts have been allocated to Clare, Cork (North), Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, Longford, Mayo, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo and Tipperary (NR) County Councils. To date 46 families have moved under the scheme and it is understood that a further 12 families are due to move shortly.</P>
      <P>In regard to Sligo the scheme provided for the acquisition or building by the local authority of two houses in 1998 and a further three houses in 1999. One house was completed and occupied last year.</P>
      <P>The pilot scheme is implemented at local level by the local authorities in conjunction with Rural Resettlement Ireland. Local authorities liaise directly with RRI in relation to the allocation of dwellings to households under the rural resettlement programme. A waiting list is maintained by RRI and each local authority, in consultation with RRI or the relevant RRI country resettlement board, selects eligible applicants from the waiting list. Specific data on the composition of the waiting list are not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>I propose to continue the scheme and my Department will consider requests from local authorities for additional starts under the scheme, where necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce a generally available grant for first-time purchases of older homes or specifically for the renovation of derelict houses as any additional grant aid would, in present market circumstances, be likely to be absorbed in higher prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are a number of targeted options currently available to assist vulnerable groups such as lower income households to <Col N="797" /> secure necessary improvement works to their houses. These include the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the disabled persons and essential repairs grant scheme and the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the Finance Act, 1998, residential tax incentives for the refurbishment and construction of rented dwellings in the rural renewal tax designated area of Longford, Leitrim and parts of Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo were introduced. These tax incentives were extended to owner-occupied housing under the Finance Act, 1999. The new incentives allow 100% of expenditure on the refurbishment of owner-occupied housing to be offset against the owner-occupier's total income over ten years. Similar relief on construction expenditure is available for owner occupiers, within the rural renewal tax designated area, at the rate of 5% per annum for ten years.</P>

      <P>This proposal was included in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Westmeath County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002 announced last July. Given the level of competing demand, the limited funding available, and the fact that Westmeath County Council has not ranked its proposals in priority order, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time.</P>

      <P>In the context of the establishment of a new taxi licensing regime, it has not been practi<Col N="798" /> cable to provide for a universal requirement of wheelchair accessibility in the short-term given that early and rapid progress is needed to respond to current customer demand for taxis. In recognition of the need to promote and incentivise the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis, the fee for the grant of a new wheelchair accessible taxi has been fixed at £100, with a £5,000 fee for ordinary taxi licences. I have also put on record my intention that, by end 2003, the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns referred to in the question and in relation to the current specification for a wheelchair accessible taxi. I have indicated that it is intended to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, of disabled persons, of taxi service providers and others, to develop quality improvements for taxi services in the medium term. These may include, if appropriate, further improvements of the existing specification for wheelchair accessible taxis. My Department intends to finalise a consultation document in the near future.</P>

      <P>The report of the national rural water monitoring committee on small scale rural waste water treatment recommends a pilot programme at up to 12 locations which would be advanced with the objective of examining a number of processes, across a range of sites, using design-build-operate procurement.</P>
      <P>The committee is drawing up tender documents at present and will recommend locations which would most appropriately meet the objectives of the pilot project. Factors to be taken into account in the selection of pilot sites include the extent of the community to be served; the availability of a suitable site for the treatment works; the quality and quantity of the receiving waters; the quality of final effluent required from the treatment process; the need for nutrient removal or tertiary treatment; availability of a sludge disposal outlet; ground levels and ground conditions locally; and necessity to confine geographic spread of sites to facilitate the DBO process.</P>
      <P>I expect to receive the committee's recommendations on the location of the pilot sites shortly.</P>

      <P>Eutrophication, or over-enrichment, which is caused mainly by excess inputs of phosphorus from various sources, is the main threat to Irish water quality. Agriculture has been identified as the single biggest contributor in this regard accounting for 73% of total phosphorus inputs. Significant inputs also arise from sewage discharges and from industry.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, my Department has been pursuing a comprehensive, integrated strategy to tackle all sources of eutrophication. Major catchment-based projects for the establishment of water quality monitoring and management systems are well under way, or nearing completion, in relation to Loughs Derg and Ree, Lough Leane and the Rivers Boyne, Liffey and Suir. Substantial investment, of more than £160 million, is also being made in sewage infrastructure in these catchments. The strategy is underpinned by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorus) Regulations, 1998, which set clear targets for reducing phosphorus levels in rivers and lakes by end 2007.</P>
      <P>For purposes of implementing the EU Water Framework Directive, my Department is now promoting the establishment by local authorities of river basin management projects to address water management in all inland and coastal waters, including groundwaters, and all sources of water pollution. Some £50 million is being assigned by my Department to support local authority expenditure on River Basin Management projects with financial support at a rate of 100%. A river basin management project for the south-east has been approved in principle, and I expect similar projects to address inland and coastal waters in all other areas will be approved during the current year. This comprehensive approach is being supported by my Department's major investment programme in sewage infrastructure facilities throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for capital investment of almost £3 billion, the major portion of which will be devoted to waste water infrastructure. The investment programme places particular emphasis on the provision of phosphorus reduction facilities where a need is indicated in this regard. Discharges to waters from industrial sources are subject to licensing controls operated by local authorities and the EPA. The Minister for <Col N="801" /> Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has substantial initiatives under way to tackle phosphorus inputs from agriculture, including the rural environment protection scheme and the farm waste management scheme. A voluntary agreement has been concluded with the Irish Detergents and Allied Products Association which provides for an incremental move to zero-phosphate domestic laundry detergents by IDAPA members. The agreement sets targets of 55% by end June 2000, 90% by end 2001 and 95% by end 2002. The June 2000 target has been met.</P>
    <P>Additional protection against pollution of waters by nitrates will be provided by action programmes to be developed in relation to those areas where the levels of nitrates in groundwaters are approaching or exceeding the limits set by European legislation. As I indicated in a public statement in July 2000, the affected waters are located in counties Carlow, Cork, Kerry, Louth and Waterford. Work is under way on the identification of the catchments related to these waters and, on its completion, I will formally designate the appropriate areas as nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs). The voluntary Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates (the blue book issued in 1996) will become mandatory in an NVZ. A primary consideration will be the management of manures and slurries.</P>
    <P>My Department provides grant support to an Taisce annually for administration of the blue flag scheme, which has become a symbol throughout Europe of clean bathing water. There has been a steady improvement in Irish bathing water quality throughout the 1990s and a recent report of the European Commission indicates that the results for monitoring of bathing water quality in Ireland in 2000 are among the best in Europe. The compliance rate for mandatory values for bathing water quality in 2000 was 98% and 100% in coastal zones and freshwater zones, respectively.</P>

This represents a threefold increase in expenditure for these services by comparison to the 1994-99 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first phase of a rolling three-year water services investment programme for the period <Col N="802" /> 2000-02, providing for investment of £2.1 billion on major water and sewerage schemes, was announced in July 2000. Expenditure incurred under the programme in 2000 together with investment in rural water supplies amounted to £335 million, an increase of 18% on the 1999 expenditure. This level of expenditure will underpin the efficiency and quality of the water supply system and provide increased capacity for continuing sustainable economic development.</P>

      <P>I have no direct function with regard to the provision of waste collection services. Under the Waste Management Act, 1996, local authorities have a qualified obligation to collect, or arrange for the collection of, household waste, and may collect other wastes. A local authority may, for the purpose of the proper management of waste, make bye-laws requiring a holder of household or commercial waste to present such waste for collection in such manner as may be specified, for example, in segregated receptacles.</P>
      <P>It is proposed very shortly to make regulations under section 34 of the 1996 Act providing for the granting of waste collection permits by local authorities. A local authority may require the holder of a waste collection permit granted by the authority to provide for segregated collection of household or commercial waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local and regional waste management plans incorporate proposals for household segregation and separate collection of organic waste and dry recyclable materials in large urban areas. A segregated household collection scheme for dry recyclables is currently being provided to some 100,000 households in the Dublin region and will progressively be extended with a view, ultimately, to providing segregated collection services for dry and organic wastes to some 80% of households in the region. I understand that local authorities in other regions are moving to provide, or arrange for the provision of, equivalent segregated collection and recovery services within their functional areas. Repak Limited, which was established to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste, is prepared to make funding available to assist local authorities in the initiation and development of such services. Repak Limited also operates a nation-wide subsidy scheme to support the segregated collection <Col N="803" /> and subsequent recycling of commercial and industrial packaging waste.</P>

      <P>The Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001 has been passed by Seanad Eireann and I expect shortly to commence the Second Stage of the Bill in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide a legal mechanism by which to bring the current waste management planning process to an early and satisfactory conclusion, in accordance with our EU obligations. Currently, three out of 15 local authorities in three regional groups have refused to adopt the proposed regional plan that is before them. These authorities, in effect, are obstructing progress on the part of the majority and impeding the delivery of improved waste services and the development of an effective and safe waste infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the Government has decided that the power to make a waste management plan should be transferred from the elected members of a local authority to the relevant manager, and to make other supporting legislative amendments.</P>
      <P>These amendments will allow local authority management to conclude the planning process and remove any perceived obstacles to the effective implementation of regional plans. It will clear the way to deliver on all aspects of waste modernisation &ndash; segregated collection services, higher recycling and recovery performance, and a dramatic reduction in disposal to landfill.</P>
      <P>In bringing forward this amending legislation, I am also taking the opportunity of providing a statutory basis for a number of other important waste management and anti-litter measures, including a new environmental levy of up to 15p on the supply by retailers of plastic shopping bags and, potentially, the extension of the levy to other products which are problematic in waste management terms; a levy on the landfill of waste, at an initial rate of not more than £15 per tonne; the establishment of an environment fund, through which the proceeds of these levies will be disbursed to finance beneficial environmental initiatives in a range of areas including waste management, environmental education and awareness, and an increase in the on-the-spot litter fine to £100 and provision for future changes in the level of the fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also proposed to make a number of technical amendments to the Waste Management Act, 1996, to bring legal clarity to the licensing, by the <Col N="804" /> Environmental Protection Agency, of certain waste activities.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the measures provided for in the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001 are necessary and desirable, and I have no proposals for substantive amendment of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Changing our Ways advocated a major reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach utilising a range of waste treatment options to deliver effective and efficient waste services and ambitious recycling and recovery targets. It outlined some of the main issues associated with the use of alternative collection systems and waste treatment technologies, and pointed out that no one solution can address all waste management requirements. Local authorities were advised to identify and fully assess the various issues involved, with a view to identifying the nature, scale and mix of facilities which in their circumstances appeared to offer the best balance between maximised recovery of materials or energy, and minimised environmental emissions, at reasonable cost.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the policy, and the waste recovery targets, set out in Changing our Ways, local and regional waste management plans incorporate proposals for household segregation and separate collection of organic and dry recyclable wastes in urban areas; an extended network of &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities in rural areas, with specified target densities; an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations; a range of centralised composting and other biological treatment facilities; support for home composting, especially in rural areas; thermal treatment facilities, and landfill facilities for the environmentally safe disposal of residual wastes.</P>

      <P>In general, all contributions paid or credited, at the appropriate rate, on a person's record are assessed when their entitlement to a pension is being examined. However, while pre-1953 insurance contributions may be counted towards the basic number of paid contributions required, they may not be used to satisfy the average contributions test. Only contributions made under the unified social insurance scheme, introduced in 1953, can be used to satisfy this test.</P>
      <P>The question of allowing pre-1953 insurance to be used for the average contributions test was examined in the first phase of the review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pensions which was published in August 2000. The Review did not favour affording full recognition to these contributions because such contributions are different in nature to contributions made under the unified system.</P>
      <P>The special flat rate old age contributory pension &ndash; OACP &ndash; payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate, introduced from May 2000 is primarily designed to benefit people with pre-53 social insurance contributions who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for a pension. This is a special measure designed to benefit people who would not otherwise receive a pension, though some people who were already receiving pensions based on mixed insurance, at less than 50% of the maximum rate, have also benefited by transferring to this special pension.</P>
      <P>There are currently 31,103 people in receipt of old age contributory pension, aged 66 or over, at a reduced rate, excluding those in receipt of the special pre-53 pension while the corresponding figure for those on retirement pension, aged 65 or over, is 17,586.</P>
      <P>In the absence of a detailed assessment of the insurance records concerned it is not possible to accurately estimate the cost of allowing pre-53 insurance to be used in assessing a person's yearly average contribution record. However, if all these pensioners moved to a maximum rate old age contributory pension, the cost would be approximately £25 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department's records show that the person concerned has a total of 1,200 contributions recorded for the period 1953 to 1986, 33 years. This is equal to a yearly average of 36 contributions which entitles him to a reduced rate pension of £103.90 per week, applicable to those with a yearly average of between 20 and 47 contributions. He has a total of 406 insurance contributions paid for the years 1944-52 inclusive but the inclusion of these contributions would be of <Col N="808" /> no benefit as his yearly average would still be considerably below the 48 contributions required for receipt of maximum rate old age contributory pension.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of section 2(1) of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999, I have established the national inventory of architectural heritage. In addition, under the provisions of Section 2(2) of the above Act I have determined the form and content of the inventory and designated, for the purposes of the inventory, categories of architectural heritage. I have also approved the mechanism for the entry of individual structures in the inventory and the arrangements for the amendment or deletion of entries in the inventory. I will forward details of these determinations to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In November 1999 I delegated authority to appoint authorised officers to an official in my Department. Authorised officers have been appointed on 13 occasions since then to facilitate the carrying out of the ongoing programme of national inventory of architectural heritage surveys. Such authorised officers were empowered to enter any premises within the area covered by a survey for the purpose of carrying out their duties. As surveys cover thousands of buildings it is not possible to differentiate between those where entry was necessary from those which could be covered by an external evaluation. Authorised officers have, to date, relied and received co-operation of owners in assessing structures.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that from time to time it has been necessary, for the purposes of carrying out national inventory of architectural heritage surveys, for authorised officers to enter private dwellings. This is done with the co-operation of the owner on presentation of an authorisation from the officer concerned.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in early 1999 I announced a package of measures relating to the protection and preservation of bogs that have been proposed as candidate special areas of conservation. These initiatives do not apply to other areas of bog. Among the initiatives taken was the ban on the use of sausage machines because of the significant damage they cause. However, the use of hopper machines is still allowed, where people are still cutting turf for domestic use. I introduced a package of compensatory measures including, purchase of turbary rights from those cutting for their own use, who were disposed to cease cutting immediately; provision for the cessation of cutting by domestic cutters to be phased in over a ten year period, and compensation for commercial cutters who were required to stop cutting immediately.</P>
      <P>I believe that these measures strike the correct balance between our conservation responsibilities under the EU Habitats Directive and the needs of local communities.</P>

    <P>The part-time jobs fall within the production category and the hours of work of the part-time employees depend not only on the requirements of the business but, in some instances, on the wishes of the employees. Some young persons from 16 to 18 years of age are employed in the business and children, legally defined as such, of 15 years of age are employed on a part-time basis of four to six hours per week, doing light work in accordance with legal requirements.

Over 92 <Col N="814" /> new child care places will be created and the retention of over 80 existing places in County Sligo will be assured as a result of this funding.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in February of this year the Cabinet committee on social inclusion decided that the funding for out of school hours projects allocated to the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and of Education and Science for after schools child care projects would be transferred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The overall result of the transfer of funds for school age child care will be the consolidation of funding for child care under the umbrella of my Department's equal opportunities child care programme. In essence the transfer of this funding puts in place a one stop shop for child care funding and ensures that applicants, both private and community based, will be dealt with by my Department's equal opportunities child care programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of this transfer of responsibilities a considerable number of out of school hours appli<Col N="816" /> cations were transferred to my Department from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. These applications obviously had an immediate impact on the workload of the assessment team who are employed by Area Development Management Limited. Arrangements have been put in place by Area Development Management Limited to ensure the resumption of the normal three month processing period for applications. The total funding for child care allocated over the period of the National Development Plan to my Department is £344 million. To date I have allocated over £50 million to child care projects which will support over 14,000 child care places and the creation of almost 6,000 new child care places and lead to quality improvements in the child care service provided. There is no closing date for the programme and as soon as completed applications are received in my Department, they are immediately registered and within a few days are forwarded to Area Development Management Limited, the initial assessment-appraisal stage.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that there will be no undue delay in processing applications under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme.</P>

      <P>There are no reliable estimates for the number of non-EU nationals working here illegally. Neither my Department nor the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has the lead role in matters pertaining to labour migration, has proposals to introduce a scheme whereby such persons could be regularised while in the country. It is of course open to such persons to return to their country of origin and to seek to obtain a legal basis for entry through the work permit system. Approximately 6,000 work permits were issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 1999, 18,000 in 2000 and 14,000 to date in 2001.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 60 of 12 April 2001 on the issue of the collection of fines which was the subject of a value for money study carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General. A high level group comprising representatives of my Department, the Departments of Environment and Local Government, Finance, Social Community and Family Affairs, the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service has been established to address the issues highlighted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. This group will examine various proposals to improve the fines collection system, including the type of measures referred to by the Deputy. I should also state that the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General was discussed at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts recently and all the agencies involved in the collection of fines have to report back to the committee later this year on the positive steps being taken to address the issues raised.</P>

      <P>Last September I appointed an Action Group on Access to Third Level Education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from the three target groups. The group was asked to advise on the specific interventions which would be most effective in making further progress in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> I have recently received the report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education and I am considering its recommendations. The Government has set aside £95 million over the period 2000-06 to tackle under-representation in third level education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and, as an initial step pending the findings of the action group, I announced, last September, the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>
    <P>The action group's report contains recommendations on the eligibility criteria governing the category of students who should qualify for the special rate of grant.</P>
    <P>I also announced last September the introduction of a new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage with a provision of £1 million in 2001, which will be administered in conjunction with the area partnerships.</P>
    <P>I have increased significantly the provision for the student assistance-access fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000. The objective of the fund, which is ESF-aided, is to assist students who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>I have also increased substantially the level of funding allocated under the fund for students with disabilities from IR£700,000 in 1999 to IR£1,232,889 in 2000. This fund, which is ESF-aided, provides grants towards the provision of services and the purchase of equipment for students with disabilities attending courses in third level institutions or post leaving certificate courses.</P>

      <P>The planning group which was charged with bringing forward proposals for a national <Col N="820" /> centre for the visually impaired has put forward a comprehensive range of proposals for the development of a centre at Drumcondra, Dublin. The centre will deliver a comprehensive range of professional support services for the visually impaired from pre-school level to young adulthood. The services in question will be available to all pupils on the Drumcondra campus and on an outreach basis to students with visual impairment throughout the country. The planning group's proposals also envisage the development of co-educational provision for sighted and visually impaired students at Drumcondra. The Sisters of Charity were represented on the planning group and participated fully in its deliberations.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy of my commitment to ensuring adequate educational support services are made available to all students with visual impairment. My commitment in this regard is reflected in the fact that I have secured additional funding of £500,000 in the current year to facilitate the appointment of additional staff to the existing services for the visually impaired at Drumcondra. However, the Deputy will appreciate that the recommendations brought forward by the planning group involve a range of complex issues which require very careful consideration. As part of this process my Department, in consultation with the Department of Health and Children, will shortly be appointing a project team to undertake a technical assessment of the scope and likely cost of the project. Detailed terms of reference for the project team are currently being finalised by my Department. The position relating to the Sisters of Charity lands attaching to the Merrion school is a matter for the sisters.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 324 of 23 May 2000, the resource teacher-special needs assistant, as outlined, was made available to the school; is so, if they are now in place; if the school in question was entitled to a teaching post under the developing school status during the past year; and if any such post was allocated.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16260/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): The resource teaching and special needs assistant support mentioned in the parliamentary question to which the Deputy refers were allocated to the school in question in June 2000. The resource teaching service for the school in question was re-organised in October 2000 under an arrangement which involved the allocation of a full-time resource teacher post on a shared basis between the school in question and another school in the area. Where resource teacher or special needs assistant supports are allocated, it is a matter for the schools concerned to fill such posts.</P>
    <P>In the case in question, the schools involved have encountered difficulty in recruiting suitable staff to provide the services in question. I have asked my Department's inspectorate to investigate the needs of the school to which the Deputy refers with a view to ensuring that any necessary support services are put in place as speedily as possible. The school in question was not entitled to a teaching post under the developing school status during the past year.</P>

      <P>Tax relief provisions on the payment of tuition fees have been introduced in recent years as follows:</P>
      <P>&ndash;the Finance Act, 1995, provided for tax relief on tuition fees paid by students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration at approved private third level colleges;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the Finance Act, 1996, as amended by the Finance Act, 1997, provided for tax relief for tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration at colleges approved for the higher education grants scheme and at approved private third level colleges;</P>
      <P>&ndash;the Finance Act, 1999, provided tax relief, at the standard rate, for the tuition fees of full-time undergraduate courses in publicly funded colleges in other EU member states.</P>
      <P>&ndash;the Finance Act, 2000, introduced tax relief at the standard rate for full-time and part-time post-graduate courses in publicly funded and private colleges in Ireland and publicly funded colleges in other EU member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;the Finance Act, 2001, inserts a new section into the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 to provide for the amalgamation of the existing four tax reliefs for third level education fees: an extension of the reliefs by removing the restrictions for repeat years on individuals undertaking more than one course on individuals already holding a third level qualification and in relation to the exclusion of certain courses <Col N="824" /> in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training.</P>
    <P>The reliefs are also being extended for postgraduate fees paid for third level education in private and publicly funded third level colleges in non-EU countries. Tax relief for undergraduate fees will also now be available in EU countries for duly accredited private third level colleges. Under these provisions, tax relief is available at the standard rate. The maximum amount of fees that can be claimed under the above reliefs is £2,500 per annum.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, where grantholders are required to attend a foreign university as part of their approved course for a period of up to one year, a maintenance grant may continue to be paid where the period abroad does not affect the normal duration of the approved course. Where a maintenance grant is payable in respect of compulsory study abroad, the higher, non-adjacent rate of grant is payable for the duration of study abroad. Last November I announced the setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed. However, there are no plans at present to pay an enhanced maintenance grant rate to students who must go abroad for one year of their course.</P>
