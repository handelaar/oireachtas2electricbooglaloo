    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, last week, with the Minister for Health and Children, I announced the Government's initiative in relation to the protection of human life in pregnancy. This will involve the introduction of legislation which will be underpinned by an amendment to the Constitution in a referendum. The Bill is the outcome of a detailed and extensive consultation process which culminated in examination of the issues by the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the all-party Oireachtas committee did not reach agreement on a single course of action, <Col N="978" /> the consultation process was very helpful in examining the complex legal, medical and social issues involved. Following consideration of the report of the all-party committee by the Cabinet committee on abortion, the approach now being adopted by the Government is based on one of the three possible courses identified by the all-party committee. Stated briefly, it will protect in legislation best medical practice, while providing for a prohibition on abortion and will link the legislation with a referendum to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In relation to the all-party committee on the Constitution, to date the Government has implemented three of its recommendations. They were: constitutional recognition of local government; abolition of the death penalty; and establishment of a Referendum Commission. It is unlikely that any of the other proposals for constitutional change recommended by the all-party committee on the Constitution will be addressed in this Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put a series of questions to the Taoiseach by letter on Thursday last. A spokesman for him said publicly that the letter had not been sent prior to publication of the questions. Will the Taoiseach confirm that any delay in sending the letter to his office arose in Government Buildings and that, in fact, the letter had been delivered to Government Buildings before 5.30 p.m. on Thursday prior to publication of the questions and the accompanying letter by my press office?</P>
      <P>When the Bill was first published the Taoiseach kindly sent me an advance copy with an accompanying letter indicating that a briefing would be offered to the Opposition parties. Last week in the House he indicated that he would be prepared to clarify any matters arising and answer questions, but last Thursday his spokespersons slapped down the questions that we had sent and said we were not serious and, in effect, were playing politics. It was suggested that the questions were spurious legal points and simply intended to put up a smokescreen. This claim was also attributed to questions in the name of the Labour Party leader, Deputy Quinn. Which way does the Taoiseach want this debate to proceed &ndash; by means of the Opposition carrying out serious parliamentary scrutiny of the proposals or the kind of political tennis match which his spokespersons seem to be setting up?</P>

      <P>I will. I was told it arrived at 10.30 a.m., but if the Deputy says it was in the Department, then I accept that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second matter, as the Deputy said, I stated in the letter that I would do my utmost to facilitate any briefing or clarification requested by the leaders of the opposition. That is still the position, as I stated here on Thursday. I know that other comments were made and a note was sent to me by Deputy Quinn. The Bill is now before the House and I will endeavour to answer any of the questions that I have been asked in writing. I have</P>
      <P>answered some of Deputy Quinn's already and there may be more in a letter he sent me on Sunday. In the case of Deputy Noonan, some 34 or 35 questions have been asked and I will endeavour to answer them as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>This legislation is no different from any other before the House. I am prepared to set out the process again, as I did last week.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that my party is opposed to holding this referendum in the first instance on the grounds that it will not prevent one single additional person from going to the UK or elsewhere to have an abortion. We do, however, welcome the announcement last week to establish the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to which Ms Olive Braiden has been appointed chairperson. When will that body be operational? Given that it was the one issue on which there was all-party agreement, is it the Government's intention to consult with Opposition parties on the composition of the board and on the possible selection of a chief executive? When will the referendum take place? What is the Government's preferred timetable subject to the normal constraints? Am I correct in understanding that it is the intention, subject to parliamentary time, that this Bill would have completed its passage through both Houses before Christmas and that the referendum proper would take place after 1 February? If that is to be the case, will the Government establish a referendum commission and, if so, will that commission operate in a manner identical to the one which operated during the course of the referendum on the Treaty of Nice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the Deputy's first question about the agency, the Minister is signing the regulations, the resources are available and it is his intention to move as quickly as possible on the matter. I will bring to his attention the Deputy's point about consultation. I am not opposed to that. The second question related to the timescale. The all-party committee did say a three-month period should be allowed. I am trying to honour that and have already accepted that it would be good practice. Therefore, it will be held early in the new year. As January is not the best month for a referendum, it may be held in February but no later than that. On the third question&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>: </b>In his speech of 2 October the Taoiseach said that the 6,500 women with crisis pregnancies who travelled to Britain for abortions last year demand a fair, compassionate and honest response. Does the Taoiseach believe it is a compassionate response to present a Bill that criminalises and proposes a 12 year jail sentence for any woman who in desperation might self-terminate a pregnancy in this State or anybody who might assist her? Does that provision fit under any meaning of the word &ldquo;compassion&rdquo;? The Taoiseach called for an hon<Col N="981" /> est response. How does an honest response equate with bringing forward a Bill which on the one hand criminalises a woman who might seek to terminate a pregnancy in this State or somebody who might assist her and under the same Bill a woman may get information on abortion services in Britain and may avail of abortion in Britain? Would it not be more honest if the Taoiseach presented to each woman with a crisis pregnancy a map of England and, perhaps, a ferry or air ticket because he and the Government want to shut their eyes to the predicament of such women? Does the Taoiseach agree that a crisis pregnancy, and the difficult decisions women have to make, are private matters between them and their advisers who are close to them and not matters in which the State should interfere in this most crude and unsympathetic fashion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could answer all those questions at length, but perhaps I will do so in the correct way on Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that a spokesperson on behalf of the Tánaiste was reported as saying at the weekend that while the Progressive Democrats Party in government was committed to the Bill as published, there was no agreement on the date of a referendum. The Taoiseach has indicated that the referendum will take place not later than February. Will he clarify the position between the two parties in government on the date of the referendum?</P>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's advice that in the operation of the Referendum Commission the McKenna judgment, reinforced by the Coghlan judgment, is beyond challenge and that if he intends to change procedures in respect of the Referendum Commission, it is in the application of the McKenna judgment, rather than in its principle, that any such change will take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has not fixed a date. What I was doing was replying to Deputy Quinn that it will not be before February, the first available date if we are to allow the three month period to elapse, something to which I committed myself some time ago. January is not the month for any kind of elections, if they can be avoided. Therefore, February is the earliest date, but the Government must fix a date in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in due course. That is precisely what both parties in government stated at the press conference.</P>
      <P>There has not been any discussion on the second matter, but the position is as enunciated by the Supreme Court. Any change or deviation from it would require amendments to the Constitution. I do not think that will happen. There has been some debate in the committee of the House about how the system operates. Certainly that could be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach if he would publish the legal advice which had been <Col N="982" /> made available to him in the course of preparation of this legislation in a manner similar to the way in which the legal advice of the constitutional legal adviser to the Government, the Attorney General, was made available in 1983 and 1995. He gave the impression that that would happen, but in fact what has really happened is that a legal response to a set of queries has been published by the Taoiseach. May I clarify the question because perhaps there might have been some misunderstanding of what I was asking for, although I do not think there was? In view of the expression of many legal concerns, which are serious legal concerns, not spurious or vexatious concerns, as the Taoiseach attempted to suggest in briefing notes, in order to deal with this aspect of the debate will the Taoiseach follow the precedent set in 1983 and 1995, when former Attorneys General Peter Sutherland and Dermot Gleeson had their advice to the Government published in order that everybody participating in the debate can see the legal basis upon which the Government is proceeding? That is the first question I wanted to put to the Taoiseach. I suggest that it would contribute immeasurably to the calm and reasoned debate which he is seeking if we all were working off the same legal platform regarding this particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood what the Deputy had asked me last week was, by virtue of Article 46.2, to outline the legal basis of that structure and how its parliamentary aspects would be dealt with as a second item. I have given him the advice I received.</P>
      <P>On the other advice received on detailed questions, as the Deputy will know and as the House will be aware, there was a long process over the past 11 months or so from 15 November last, when the all-party committee on the Constitution presented its report to the Government. The Cabinet sub-committee, including the Attorney General, worked its way through all aspects and fundamentally did all of the work. It is within that sub-committee that the Attorney General gave his advice. In replies to a great number of questions from the Deputy, as well as Deputy Noonan, I have given the advice of the Attorney General. As they are legal questions, by and large, the Attorney General's judgment and findings make up the bulk of the replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Question No. 2, given that the all-party Oireachtas committee has produced recommendations on a wide range of other subjects with which the Government has not yet dealt, what is the Government's view on matters such as including the office of the Ombudsman in the Constitution, allowing 15 Members of the Seanad to be elected directly by the people, reorganising the university constituencies in the Seanad and establishing a judicial council with lay representation to deal with judicial misconduct? Does the Taoiseach agree these are important issues which deserve to be <Col N="983" /> dealt with? What is his and the Government's view on these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been five reports from the all-party committee on the Constitution and we have dealt with two of them. The judicial report ran into difficulties during the year and there are no further proposals on the issue. As the issues must be dealt with, I suggested that perhaps the Whips should deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>I circulated the proposals on a range of other issues to the relevant Departments and requested a response. I have received a response in many instances, but not in all cases. We were seeking an omnibus way to deal with a substantial number of the amendments. A lot of work will be involved as an enormous number of proposals require constitutional change, not just in regard to modernising the language or gender-proofing which could be done by omnibus reports. Many proposals would require separate questions and we are seeking a way to deal with them. The all-party committee has done a good job and it would be a useful exercise if a mechanism could be found for putting a range of the questions in a referendum that perhaps would not be too controversial. I hope in the next month or so to be able to finalise the parliamentary position on the matter. While I do not intend to hold another referendum because the Dáil will run out of time, I would like to, at least, put forward how Departments have structured the work because that will not change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that it is not his intention to hold another referendum apart from the abortion referendum in the lifetime of the current Dáil? On the abortion referendum, does he propose finalising parliamentary procedures before the Dáil breaks on 14 December and holding a referendum in the spring? Will he confirm the abortion referendum will be held on its own without any other issue being put to the people on the same day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a request from the Deputy's party I have already given a commitment that the abortion referendum will be held on its own. The answer to the other questions is &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach a question for perhaps the third or fourth time in order that there is absolute clarify in regard to what I am looking for and I have an absolutely clear understanding of his response. In view of the complex legal and constitutional nature of the issue, practice in the past and the fact there were two <Col N="984" /> judgments by the Supreme Court in the X and C cases, and bearing in mind that this will undoubtedly be legally contentious during the debate, is it the intention of the Taoiseach and the Government to publish in its entirety the legal advice received by the Government from the Attorney General on this legislation, and not to pick and choose in terms of making that advice available? While the question is clear, so far the Taoiseach has not answered it clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope my answer is clear. Last week the Deputy asked for legal advice on Article 40.6.4. I was also asked about the parliamentary process, and I produced it exactly as the Attorney General outlined it to us. On the other matters, I said all the issues relating to the legislation and arising from the time of the report of the all-party committee until the Government produced legislation were dealt with in great detail and the deliberations set out by the Cabinet committee on abortion. There is no entire minute on what happened in the committee over 12 months, but on a range of specific legal and medical questions there is medical advice and legal advice, given by the Attorney General, available, and I intend to reply in full to questions by setting out the information I have received. There should be no difficulty in understanding this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My request to the Taoiseach is very simple. Will he make available to other Members the formal legal advice which the Attorney General furnished to the Government in respect of this final documentation passed by the Cabinet so as to enable all of us to have the certainty that we are operating from the same legal framework? Otherwise, because of the history of this issue, there will be disputes from time to time about interpretation. Does the Taoiseach agree that it would be far from satisfactory then if we were dependent on him offering snippets from time to time from the legal advice? He could contribute to the calm and constructive debate he is seeking by publishing in its entirety the legal advice formally received from the Attorney General in respect of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy thinks there is one enormous document on legal advice, which is not the case. Right through the deliberations of the Cabinet committee the Attorney General gave his advice, both verbally and in writing, on all aspects, and I have that available to me. I will give that advice in the form of replies to the very detailed questions which have been asked. I cannot do any more. I do not have one big document which I can hand over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware that significant progress is being made in Europe in drawing up a European Bill of Human Rights, which would apply to all countries in the European Union. He is also aware that his predecessors in government negotiated a protocol to <Col N="985" /> the Maastricht treaty, effectively to prevent legislation in respect of abortion being imposed here by way of secondary legislation from the European Union. My legal advice is that while the protocol protects the existing Constitution, in particular, Article 40.3.3, this protection would not extend to the new amendment proposed by the Government unless the protocol is renegotiated. Has the Government considered this, and is it it's intention to renegotiate the protocol to the Maastricht treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised there is nothing in the Government's proposal that has a Euro-</P>
      <P>pean law dimension, and it does notaffect any area of law in which the European Union or the European Court of Justice has jurisdiction under EU law. The terms of the law envisaged by the amendment relate solely to Irish domestic criminal law defining and prohibiting abortion within Ireland and they are specially drafted to have no effect outside Ireland or on travel to and from Ireland. The proposed change to the Constitution does not affect the status of the 17th Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty and does not dilute or require any amendment to the protocol or any declaration or action by any other member state.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has answered the reverse of what I put to him. Of course what is being proposed for inclusion in the Constitution does not have any adverse effect on the protocolumn. However, we are well down the road towards a European bill of human rights. This will be superior legislation in this jurisdiction and, by way of secondary legislation, will have the force of law here.</P>
      <P>Article 40.3.3 is protected from any element of that which would legislate in the general area of the termination of pregnancies. What the Taoiseach is proposing to include in the Constitution does not have that protection. Has this been drawn to his attention? Does he propose renegotiating the protocol to ensure all parts of Article 40 will have similar protection from the application of European law by way of secondary legislation in this jurisdiction and in particular the application of a European bill of human rights, which in discussion and concept in draft form would consider that the rights of a woman are superior to the rights of the unborn and this would carry implications for what he is now doing?</P>

      <P>On Friday, 5 October, the Government was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> as stating: &ldquo;it will seek to amend the Maastricht protocol on abortion agreed in 1992 if its proposed constitutional amendment on the issue is approved by referendum.&rdquo; Is that an accurate report of the Government's position because the Taoiseach's earlier reply seems to contradict it?</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn's question, I am advised that it does not seek a <Col N="986" /> change. In reply to Deputy Noonan's question, as I stated in the House last year, the work on human rights is put forward as a non-legislative model and there will be many aspects of it which will affect our law. The Deputy is correct in that regard. It was agreed that it would not be legislatively based because most countries, except those without written constitutions, would have had difficulty and would be seeking protocols to it. There was a long complex debate about extradition and other matters. If, following the work of the convention, the charter for fundamental human rights were to be legislated for, which might happen in the context of a future European constitution, we would need protocols in many areas. This may be one such area but not the only one.</P>

        <b>:</b> In preparing to publish and draw up the anti-abortion amendment the Government has brought forward, from the time the all-party committee reported what groups did the Taoiseach consult regarding the final amendment? In particular, why did he not consult with any pro-choice group whereas, apparently, those who wanted a referendum to outlaw abortion were consulted with freely? Furthermore, why did he wait until the publication of the 25th amendment to bring forward the new crisis pregnancy agency when it could have been brought forward, and performed a useful role, at a much earlier date? Finally, will he clarify an issue which I believe will be on the minds of many concerned women? One of the roles of the agency is to treat women who have had abortions with compassion and understanding, and give them counselling. Should a woman present who has had an abortion in this State, through whatever means, will the agency be obliged to refer her to the Garda or the Director of Public Prosecutions since the Government has criminalised, with a term of 12 years in prison, what she has done?</P>

To answer the Deputy's first question, there was more consultation on this issue than on most other issues from the time the Government established the Cabinet committee and made requests for people to involve themselves in the preparation of a <Col N="987" /> White Paper. There were 105,000 individual submissions to the Green Paper and when the all-party committee subsequently requested views tens of thousands put forward their views. People from various organisations, and from none, put forward views. There was, therefore, no lack of consultation or information. To the best of my knowledge, an enormous number of people in organisations and in none put forward their views and were able&mdash;</P>

      <P>By way of clarification of the Taoiseach's reply, Protocol 17 of the Maastricht treaty refers explicitly to Article 40.3.3 of the Irish Constitution, the amendment of 1983. If this legislation is enacted and subsequently ratified by way of referendum and the Constitution is amended, there will be two additional parts in the Constitution &ndash; Articles 40.3.4 and 40.3.5. They will not be referred to at all in Protocol 17 as it currently stands and, therefore, will not enjoy the protection the protocol gives to Article 40.3.3. Did I hear the Taoiseach accurately when he said it is not the Government's intention to attempt to amend in any way Protocol 17 to ensure it would now refer not just to Article 40.3.3, but also Articles 40.3.4 and 40.3.5?</P>

      <P>I am advised that it is probably not necessary, but, as the Deputy knows, it is a regular occurrence at European Council meetings that protocols are just nodded through when people request a change. My note states that the change proposed to the Constitution does not affect in any way the status of Protocol 17 of the Maastricht treaty and does not in any way dilute or require any amendment to the protocol or any declaration or action by the other member states. <Col N="988" /> I can imagine someone making the point the Deputy made and saying that if it is passed, the protocol should be amended. If it were, this would not create a difficulty with member states because on a whole range of issues protocols are regularly nodded through at European Council level.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has given Deputy Quinn a different answer from the one he gave me. He indicated to me that if a threat emerged from the passage of the Bill incorporating the European Convention of Human Rights to Articles 43.3.4º and 40.3.5º of the Constitution, as they will become if this referendum is passed, he will seek an additional protocol to save these subsections from rights granted under the convention on a European-wide basis. He has now told Deputy Quinn he may seek an amendment to the protocol to the Maastricht Treaty, yet he told me he had no intention of seeking one. Does his advice cover the Bill incorporating the convention or did he make up that aspect?</P>

      <P>Two different issues arise here. Perhaps Deputy Noonan was not listening to what I told Deputy Quinn. Deputy Noonan asked about the Bill incorporating the European Convention of Human Rights, which was in draft form last year and legislated for. I said it would affect the Constitution in a number of ways and the amendment of protocols would be required. Deputy Quinn asked about the present position leaving aside the convention. I outlined the advice I have received on that aspect and added that if this was raised I do not believe there would be a difficulty. They are two separate issues.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that on 3 July last I asked him why the Government had left it so late to inform the ESB of its rejection of its plans to invest in Poland. He replied that the scale of the project and the size of the investment was not known until prior to the decision. Deputy Jim Higgins submitted a freedom of information request to his Department which revealed that the Government was aware of the full implications of the investment plan last February. Will the Taoiseach take this opportunity to correct the record of the House and to indicate that the information he gave in the House to Deputy Quinn and me on 3 July was incorrect? Will he also take this opportunity to make amends to the ESB which regards what he said as a slur on its professionalism? Given that the Government had been fully informed of the true position last February, the Taoiseach has an obligation to correct the record to show the error was on the side of the Government and not the ESB.</P>

      <Quest>if he will pay the salaries of secretaries and caretakers in primary and post-primary schools.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking ser<Col N="993" /> vices in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools, and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salaries. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grants system.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>
      <P>At second level, in addition to the arrangements outlined above, schools currently receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund. Provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003 as the FÁS school based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services for schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the redistribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post-primary levels are now almost finalised and I expect to be in a position to launch them within the next week. My Department is arranging for circulars to be issued to all primary and post-primary schools. These circulars, which will be available shortly, will outline details of the new funding arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to a press release issued by his Department on 4 July, the heading of which was &ldquo;Massive enhancement of caretaker and secretarial support?&rdquo;  Does he accept that, nearly two months after primary and post-primary schools reopened, there is unbridled chaos throughout the country? Schools that have caretaker and secretarial staff, not to mention classroom assistants, library assistants etc., under FÁS funded schemes are now very uncertain what their regulations and entitlements will be under a new regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Was it not ridiculous and irresponsible of the Minister to pull the rug from under one scheme &ndash; the FÁS funded scheme &ndash; which provided <Col N="994" /> these services cheaply for many years for the Department of Education and Science without having in place a replacement regime? When will his Department be in a position to provide schools with some certainty? The press statement proceeds to assure schools that they will have enhanced caretaker and secretarial provisions. It now transpires that many schools will have a lower level of service than they enjoyed previously under FÁS.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not accept that the mere transfer of funds that were available to FÁS, which provided the service cheaply for schools, is not sufficient to mainstream caretaking and secretarial needs? He has previously paid lip-service to the Blackstock report. If that is to adhered to in terms of equity and adequacy of funding, it will require significant additional funds over and above those available from FÁS, not merely moving the deck chairs on the Titanic.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants, with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme, will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE schemes in schools up to and including 2004, depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and, therefore, reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Minister made this announcement and issued the press statement in early July without having thought out the implications of this proposal? It was quite clear from a meeting that I had with senior officials in the Minister's Department in the middle of July that many aspects of the proposal had not been thought through and that there are, in fact, very negative implications for many schools throughout the country with regard to the changeover.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister the reason for the delay. After his statement in July he issued one on 17 September promising clarity within two weeks. It is now three weeks since that date and we still have not received any clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister explain how he proposes to disperse the £32 million in the current year? Specifically, will he state if, in the case of secretar<Col N="996" /> ies and caretakers employed under the 1978-1979 scheme, they will receive additional funding, or will they be excluded? Will he explain what will happen in the case of schools that have several CE scheme participants? With regard to those schools, largely disadvantaged, with a full complement of 15 CE scheme participants doing vital work, including maintenance, decoration, classroom assistance, meal preparation etc., what are the implications of the plans? They stand to be further disadvantaged by the Minister's proposal. Will he explain this to schools now? It is only fair that school principals should be clear in this the second month of the school year where they stand for the rest of the year. It is only fair to those on community employment schemes that there is clarity about this. Will the Minister answer those questions?</P>

      <Quest>the proposals negotiated by him for supervision and substitution in primary and post-primary schools; and the contingency plans he has in place to keep schools open in the event of these proposals being rejected by one or more of the teacher unions.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions on the issue of supervision and substitution in post-primary schools have recently been concluded with the teachers' unions and a final formal offer was put to the unions on 28 September. The offer included the following elements. Additional payment will be made to teachers already employed in the school who volunteer to undertake supervision duties during break times and immediately before and after school. Additional payment will be made to teachers already employed in the school who volunteer to provide substitution cover for casual absences of colleagues on sick leave or school business. Schools will be provided with funding on the basis of a requirement of 37 hours' supervision and substitution per teacher. Participation in these duties would be voluntary and payment will be on verified delivery of the service. Payment will be at the rate of £27 per hour inclusive of the 5.5% payable from 1 October 2001. Payments will be made twice yearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The TUI executive has decided to put the offer to a ballot of its members without a recommendation. The result of that ballot will be known on 26 October. The ASTI central executive has rejected a recommendation from the standing committee that the &ldquo;Final Offer on Supervision and Substitution&rdquo; should be put to a ballot of members. The CEC has rejected the offer. <Col N="998" /> Instead the CEC decided to ballot its members on withdrawal from all voluntary supervision and substitution. The motion also asks for approval that the <i>status quo</i> continue where voluntary supervision and substitution in schools is concerned until a directive is issued pursuant to the outcome of the ballot. A ballot will take place at ASTI branch venues on Tuesday, 9, and Wednesday, 10 October, that is, today and tomorrow. The ballots will be counted on Friday, 12 October. Discussions with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation on the model of delivery in that sector are continuing.</P>
    <P>I hope teachers offered £27 per hour for work done previously on a voluntary basis will not opt for a course of action which will lead to disruption in schools. In the event that teachers opt to withdraw from supervision and substitution, there will be difficulties in schools.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>However, I will assist school management in every way possible to deal with situations that arise and to minimise disruption to pupils. My officials are in regular contact with the school management bodies on the most appropriate arrangements to deal with any difficulties which might arise.</P>

He referred to the ASTI in his reply and I regret that the union did not see fit to put this proposal on supervision and substitution to its members for a proper ballot.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister give guarantees and what negotiations has he had with representatives of school management bodies to assure parents and pupils, some of whom face examinations that will determine their career prospects, that schools will remain open notwithstanding the outcome of the ballot which could see schools threatened with closure before the end of the month?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I assumed office in January 2000 as Minister for Education and Science, I have provided unprecedented additional resources and supports for people with disabilities. These actions were based on the Government decision of October 1998 to provide all necessary supports based on assessment of needs. In addition, in August this year, I announced a range of important new measures in the special education area. These measures include the holding of a special needs education forum, the introduction of a Disabilities (Education and Training) Bill, the accelerated development of the National Educational Psychological Service, the accelerated development of the National Council for Special Education, and the establishment of a group of senior officials in my Department to examine special education services for students with special needs at second level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements for holding the special needs education forum are proceeding in my Department. My objective is that the forum should take place in early November 2001. The discussions at the forum will be considered in the context of the <Col N="1000" /> debate on the Disabilities (Education and Training) Bill which I hope to publish as soon as possible. This Bill is being treated as a priority by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>A priority &ndash; it will not be published until next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of the Bill will be to clarify and copperfasten the entitlements of people with disabilities to appropriate support services and to facilitate the delivery of these services in an effective manner. It is not possible in advance of the preparation of the Bill to quantify the likely costs involved.</P>
      <P>The original development plan for the national educational psychological service &ndash; NEPS &ndash; envisaged the service achieving nationwide coverage by the end of 2004. The Government has approved my proposals to accelerate the development of the service to achieve nationwide coverage by the end of next year. This will mean an increase in the number of psychologists employed by the service from its current 83 to 200 by the end of 2002. The annual cost of such an expansion is estimated at £6 million.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>The Government has also approved the accelerated establishment of the national council for special education. The intention is that the council, which will be responsible for the provision of research, expert advice and certain operational functions in the delivery of special education services, will be set up this year and will be operating on a full statutory basis as soon as feasible thereafter. The detailed arrangements for the structure and operation of the council and the associated costs are currently the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>A group of senior officials in my Department has commenced a review of provision for special needs students at second level. I expect this group to report soon and it is my intention to seek Government approval for any measures considered necessary to improve services in this area.</P>
      <P>The above measures will build on the substantial progress made by the Government in the special needs area. One such development, which has had a major impact, was the Government's decision in October 1998 that all children with special needs within the primary system should have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. As a result of this decision the number of special resource teachers supporting children with special needs has increased from 104 to approximately 1,000 and the number of special needs assistants supporting children with special needs has grown from less than 300 to approximately 2,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the resource teacher service in the current year is estimated at £30 million. Funding of £23.5 million has been allocated for the special needs assistant service in the current year. The measures which I have outlined will ensure the <Col N="1001" /> delivery of a quality education service for all children with special needs and remove the unacceptable situation of parents of special needs children having to resort to litigation to assert their children's rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply defies logic. He says that the Disabilities (Education and Training) Bill is a priority, yet in the draft legislative programme it will not be published until next year. The promised task force report on autism has yet to be published and in terms of commitment to children with special needs FÁS-funded classroom assistants for these children have been withdrawn throughout the country. That certainly does not look like the position of the open cheque book which the Minister said he had after the Jamie Sinnott judgment.</P>
      <P>What plans has the Department in regard to second level education for children with special needs, particularly children with autism and Asperger's syndrome? Today's <i>Education &amp; Living</i> supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i> states that a parent is threatening legal action in pursuit of an appropriate education for her child. What about the education and training needs, the ongoing lifelong learning of persons over 18 years, arising from the Jamie Sinnott judgment? The Minister of State with responsibility for adult education is here and he may wish to comment on the apparent contradiction between the Department's commitment to lifelong learning and the withdrawal of educational services for people with a disability once they reach the age of 18.</P>
      <P>Can something practical be done for parents of children with special needs? In the health arena we have given some tax concessions to parents who acquire orthodontic treatment privately. Can we do something tangible in terms of recognising the scarcity of speech and occupational therapists and the whole gamut of services required by children with disability and can we say to parents that given the fact that we cannot provide the service publicly we will fund their access to the service if they can procure it privately?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with all other areas of the public service, the planning and building unit of my Department is undergoing a constant process of evaluation and change within the context of the strategic management initiative and the process of performance management and <Col N="1003" /> development. The planning and building unit at present processes over 850 major primary and second level school projects. Last year alone, in excess of £200 million was expended on primary and second level school accommodation. In the current year the expectation is that in excess of £220 million will be expended.</P>
      <P>The focus of my Department's planning and building unit will increasingly be on ensuring quality, best practice and value for money through an evaluation and audit approach rather than a detailed involvement in individual projects. This will enable my Department to fulfil a more strategic, policy-orientated role in relation to school buildings. This changed role is enabled by the greater use of external design teams and by supporting school authorities.</P>
      <P>A key element of the change process will be improved communication strategies. My Department is actively considering how, through the use of Internet technology and the publication of regular bulletins, school communities and others, including Members of the Oireachtas will be able to readily access up-to-date information on the status and progress of each building project. It is my clear intention to make a new communications strategy in relation to school buildings an integral part of my Department's application of e-procurement. I want to ensure that what we do in the building unit in terms of e-procurement will contribute significantly to the Government's drive to put Ireland at the forefront of such developments internationally.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Additional Information.</i>In parallel with the conventional approach to delivery of major capital works in schools, my Department has been to the fore in advancing projects under the innovative public private partnership arrangements &ndash; PPP &ndash; envisaged in the national development plan. Drawing on the experience gained in relation to those projects, I envisage greater use of the PPP approach in the future to ensure delivery of quality buildings in a timely manner.</P>

      <P>I have some sympathy for the Minister in this area as I know he is reaping the whirlwind of his predecessor who travelled the length and breadth of the country sanctioning new schools with little follow-up and the Minister has been left with a difficult task. Some elements of the way the Department does its business could be improved significantly. Is it acceptable to the Department that with a second level school extension or a greenfield site provision it takes the Department over five years from the date it recognises a need to the time pupils move into the facility? That means a full cycle of students has gone through the system and, by any yardstick, that is grossly inefficient. Notwithstanding the fact that we had £200 million last year or £220 million this year, in light of the commitments the Minister and his predecessor have given, it is substantially short of what is required. I pay tribute <Col N="1004" /> to the staff in Tullamore who work under extraordinary pressure but it is ridiculous that every school extension or greenfield project is on a treadmill of communication between the individual school and the Department in Tullamore. There should be some element of decentralisation and local decision-making, with greater authority given to boards of management to make decisions in respect of commissioning and contracting with builders and architects. Some of them take ten years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what is happening and the process I explained in my reply. I agree that there must be more delegation &ndash; that is what I am encouraging &ndash; but a project cannot be changed in the middle. However, this is the path I am taking. Also, in parallel with the conventional approach to the major delivery of capital works in schools, my Department is to the fore in advancing projects under public-private partnerships, as envisaged in the national development plan. I envisage greater use being made of these in the future. On second level projects taking more than five years to complete, we have increased the funds available &ndash; that was the problem &ndash; and four times as much is being spent now than four years ago. The Government made an effort to deal with the backlog of work to be done and further funds will be decided in the Estimates. Tullamore is a decentralised unit, but I appreciate what the Deputy said about getting more work done in schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions</P>

      <P>The national development plan provides for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period 2000 to 2006 aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities in third level education. In September 2000 I established the action group on access to third level education to advise me on the most effective ways to increase participation by the three target groups. The group's report, which I launched in July 2001, makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students. The criteria set down for the special rates are in accordance with the recommendations of the action group on the basis that they can be implemented. The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
      <P>The action group considered that the target group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of claimants of long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance &ndash; CDA &ndash; is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22 years. The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is, students aged 23 years and over, but subject to specific conditions, namely, that he or she must qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants; that total reckonable income, after allowances are applied, in the tax year to 5 April 2001, must not exceed £7,400; that as at 1 April 2001 the applicant's spouse or partner must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments and be in receipt of full rate qualified adult allowance, or similar entitlement, in respect of the applicant, or the applicant himself or herself must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments. In order to target those most in need the action group wished eligibility for the special rates of grant to be confined to students where family income derives from long-term social welfare payments or, alternatively, specific schemes such as the community employment scheme.</P>

When I rang the Department, the girl to whom I spoke, who was very helpful, was so flustered that she said it was best to fax the details. I have them. Once an erudite journalist described me as erudite, but I read the document inside out and find it very complicated. How can a 28 year old mature student produce a child dependant allowance since it is cut off at 22 years?

      <P>I did, as the Deputy can read in my reply. There are three questions involved whichrefer to CDA. The Deputy is discussing somebody who is not in receipt of CDA, but a mature student. That is covered by the use of the word &ldquo;or.&rdquo; The applicant must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments. Obviously, the person in question is not concerned with CDA in those circumstances. If the Deputy wishes to give me details of an individual case afterwards, I will look into it.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give me a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer to one straight question? In a previous incarnation, as Minister for Social Welfare, he knew the system inside out. Is it not true to say that one cannot get child dependant allowance if one is over 23 years? &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No?&rdquo;  Can one get child benefit allowance if one is over 23 years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who is not married and who is a student cannot be the recipient of child dependant allowance. Does the Minister agree with that? &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;? Clearly, a person who applies for a grant in his or her own right as a mature student cannot possibly have anything to do with CDA. The regulations governing mature students' grants &ndash; special top-up grants &ndash; are speckled with references to child dependant allowances and the author of that document does not understand the system. That is the point of our questions. On another point, the Minister mentioned that if a person wishes to qualify as a mature student for the top-up grant, his or her income must have been less than £7,400 in the previous year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in relation to the over 23 category, we are referring to the persons themselves, not to any child dependant allowances. The applicant must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments. There is no confusion about that, it is very straightforward. Second, with regard to the figure of £7,400, that is the net reckonable income, after all allowances. The Deputy is familiar with it in farming terms, whatever else. That is not the gross income, although I have seen press statements which represented it as such. Reckonable income is the income which is included for the purposes of the scheme, after particular allowances are made. The Deputy is misunderstanding the situation. The group on access recommended a figure of about £6,600. We actually set a higher figure, as it happened afterwards. That is the basis of reckonable income.</P>

The Deputy can have the relevant income figure for each of the social welfare payments, if he wishes to go into questions on social welfare as distinct from questions on other areas. With regard to the question about numbers, this has been made retrospective to last year. About 7,000 came into the scheme, on disadvantage, on that basis. It is estimated at between 7,000 and 10,000, but the final figure will not be known until the assessment process has been completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. When the Minister refers to allowable deductions, before taking the £7,400, that relates to social welfare payments. In the case of a single person going to college as a mature student at 25 or 26 years of age, if the income from employment is more than £142 per week, that person will not qualify for the special top-up grant. That is the bottom line. Will the Minister agree that it is very mean to set the limits so low that a person is excluded if his or her income is over £142 per week, which means they would have to be on considerably less than the minimum wage? Is it not ridiculous to set a wage limit so low, no matter who recommended that to him? If some group recommended it, it was totally out of touch. I urge the Minister to have a decent look at it, have it written in plain, understandable English and bring forward proposals that will help students to get into college, rather than having them tied up in regulations and outdated financial criteria with which they cannot possibly comply.</P>

      <P>On the issue of simpler English, it is noteworthy that 7,000 disadvantaged students were able to read the documentation and make use of it. Perhaps they are a little brighter than the students of the past &ndash; I do not really know. They certainly did not appear to have any difficulty in that regard. In relation to the £7,400 figure, that is the reckonable income for social welfare purposes. It is not the gross income, it is misleading to refer to it as such and I appeal to Deputies not to do so. The Deputy knows quite well, from his experience in social welfare and farming, in particular, the allowances that are made in that situation. The relevant figure is net income after those allowances are made, not gross income. He should not confuse people by suggesting otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the operation of the five special schools for young offenders under the aegis of my Department. They are Trinity House, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin; Oberstown Boys Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin; Oberstown Girls Centre, Oberstown, Lusk, County, Dublin; Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre, Kildonan Road, Finglas West, Dublin 11, and St. Joseph's Special School, Ferryhouse, Clonmel, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>In common with many other employers, these centres have been experiencing some difficulties in recruiting and retaining suitable staff over the past year or so. The experience of the centres in this regard has been mirrored throughout the residential child care sector as a whole. In the health sector, for example, there have been considerable difficulties in filling vacancies in the new residential care facilities being developed by the regional health authorities.</P>
      <P>The larger variety of career opportunities for both potential and existing staff brought about by growth in the economy generally and the expansion of the child care sector particularly have been a major contributory factor giving rise to these difficulties. This has been typified by the larger than normal turnover of staff at these centres in the past year as some existing and experienced staff left to take up career opportunities either elsewhere in the child care sector or in related areas. In this regard the Deputy will be aware that the child care workers' salaries are governed by pay scales agreed in accordance with national pay agreements and Government pay policy.</P>
      <P>The centres in question, in addition to having a complement of sanctioned permanent staff posts, also have recourse to other staffing options such as the use of temporary and relief staff and overtime for operational purposes as needs arise.</P>
      <P>However, quite positively, the management of the centres have informed my Department that recent advertising and recruitment drives to fill vacant posts at the centres have generated a somewhat better level of response than heretofore. Management anticipate being able to fill the bulk of existing vacancies from recruitment drives currently under way at the centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the House that we are fully aware of the responsibilities of the centres in meeting the needs of the courts in this area and of the children referred to the centres by the courts. Officials from the Department are meeting with the management of these centres within the next week. I met some of the directors yesterday to get progress reports. The management will be seeing how staffing levels currently stand and we will <Col N="1011" /> hear their proposals for ensuring that appropriate staffing numbers are maintained and that operational capacity is maximised on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I have also commissioned an independent review of the existing residential service provision under the Department of Education and Science with a view to ensuring that available places are being used optimally. The outcome of this review will inform future plans in this area.</P>

      <P>With all due respect I think the Minister of State's reply is somewhat disingenuous. Does she accept that it is intolerable that one in four child care places is closed due to staff shortages? Many of us are aware of the inadequate provision in relation to residential care. I have come across a number of cases in the past couple of years where children, after a lengthy court case, who have been sentenced to a residential facility are not being catered for because there are no places. It is easy to argue that the current provision of 100 places is completely inadequate given the increase in&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State find it unacceptable that one in four of those places is currently closed because of staff shortages? Does she not accept that one of the main reasons for the high turnover of staff in the past year &ndash; I think it is about a 30% turnover in staff &ndash; is that the Minister of State in attempting to deal with the problem of facilities in health boards and increasing the pay rates &ndash; there is now a differential of about £5,000 &ndash; has contributed to the difficult situation in detention centres, that there is a need to bring pay scales within education up to the same level as those which apply in the health boards and that that is the kernel of the problem?</P>

      <P>The reduction in the number of places in these centres has as much to do with the capital redevelopment programme as it has with staff shortages. Of the 164 child care workers who are sanctioned for these centres, there are just 21.5 vacancies. As I said, it is anticipated that the bulk of these will be filled by the current recruitment drive. There is, however, a number of facilities which are out of commission because of the capital development programme, and that is true of Trinity House, Oberstown Boys Centre and Oberstown Girls Centre where&mdash;</P>

      <P>On pay for child care workers, there was always a differential between the two centres because one was linked to the teachers whereas the other was linked to the health care workers. Talks have taken place with IMPACT and SIPTU in the context of the national pay agreement and Government policy in relation to the payment of child care workers within the education sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>At all stages the health boards have to work in the best interests of the child and have to provide places which ensure the child is kept safely. Millions of pounds are going into the capital redevelopment programme of both the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science which, as I said, has led to a pressure on the service, particularly in Oberstown Boys Centre and in Oberstown Girls Centre where they are not working to full capacity. Equally, because of health and safety and the increasing needs in the Finglas centre, it is underused at the moment. It would be wrong to say that it is only the reduction in the number of staff, which is 21.5 out of 164 sanctioned, that is leading to the problems in the use of places. I am confident that arising from the review that is taking place and the establishment of the residential services board, we will see a better co-ordination of the use of places between all the facilities for children at risk.</P>

Has his offer been taken up by the United States government? What other assistance has the Government agreed to?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment, for the information of the House, on reports that three Libyan nationals and one Algerian national were arrested this morning under the Offences Against the State Act, are being detained in connection with explosives charges, and that detectives suspect that the four are part of a support group connected with Mr. bin Laden, and that they were involved with the provision of cash and documents in this jurisdiction to assist international terrorism? It is important &ndash; if media reports are correct &ndash; that this matter be confirmed and that the Taoiseach gives all information in his possession to the House.

The number of overflights by US aircraft, as reported by Shannon Airport air traffic control, has increased to some degree, but to date only one military-type aircraft has asked to use the facilities. To facilitate where possible will continue to be the arrangement. No other arrangements have been entered into or requested.</P>
      <P>On Sunday last, with the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, we convened a meeting of the Security Council for last night. At that meeting, both the United States and the United Kingdom briefed their colleagues on the military action undertaken in Afghanistan last night and on Sunday night. They will continue to keep the Security Council informed. The unanimous view of the Security Council last night, consistent with the position that they have taken, is that of wholehearted support for the action taken in self-defence&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have requested today that a high level briefing by the UN secretariat on the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan take place later this evening. I will bring to the attention of the Minister the point made by Deputy Quinn about bringing in the aid organisations. We have stated clearly that the humanitarian briefing should continue and that there should be as much <Col N="1017" /> co-operation as possible. I am not sure of Mr. Annan's arrangements with the individuals and agencies. Perhaps, this process is already under way but I will check the position. We made it clear at all times, including last night, that the humanitarian issue should be in the statement, and we will continue with that line. It is vital that there is co-operation and assistance and we have, like many countries, assisted with this aid.</P>
      <P>It is correct that a number of non-nationals were arrested this morning. I have had only a short confidential briefing on the matter and I do not know if these people will be charged. However, the Garda has been monitoring a number of individuals for a considerable time, and particularly in the past four weeks. There is some evidence that these people might have links, or some kind of relationship, with individuals who are being sought in the United States. There is no evidence at this stage, according to my briefing, that they have been involved in any way &ndash; either through explosives, documents or contacts &ndash; but the gardaí are continuing their investigations. I received a preliminary briefing today but have not had a more detailed briefing. If more sinister detail emerges I will be glad to communicate with Opposition leaders. At this stage I have no evidence to communicate.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his capacity as president of the UN Security Council, is responsible for the agenda at Security Council meetings. Last night, the US and British governments stated that it was now the intention that military action be extended to countries other than Afghanistan. What is the Irish position in so far as the president of the Security Council, Deputy Cowen, is concerned on any extension of military activity to jurisdictions other than Afghanistan?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has briefed me on this matter today. At this stage there is no reason to believe any other action is imminent or being considered. The likelihood of an imminent attack has been raised but there is every indication that the US is looking at a long and multifaceted campaign against international terrorism for which it is seeking to build a broad coalition of support. The US response to date has been careful and calibrated. Last night it did not emphasise that it would do anything other than follow terrorists it wishes to seek if that was necessary but there is no proposal on the table at <Col N="1018" /> present and I think that is unlikely in the short-term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night RTE screened a &ldquo;True Lives&rdquo; documentary which revealed the horror and plight of families that have been affected by hepatitis C, and who are part and parcel of the Lindsay tribunal of inquiry. It was brought to the attention of the nation that its current terms of reference excludes reference to pharmaceutical companies. The concerns that were expressed in some detail cannot be addressed by the tribunal as it is currently constituted. No doubt the Taoiseach and the Government have been briefed on this matter. On behalf of the 96 HIV victims and the 200 hepatitis C victims, I formally ask that the terms of reference of the tribunal be extended by way of motion in this House, with presumably the consent of the chairperson, to enable it to examine the role that pharmaceutical companies played in this unfortunate incident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach, in considering Deputy Quinn's request, also consider how more appropriate compensation schemes can be put in place for persons with haemophilia who were inadequately compensated in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidence before the Lindsay tribunal has indicated that the majority of the HIV infections in haemophiliacs were caused by imported products as I think was indicated last night. The Irish Haemophilia Society has requested that the terms of reference be extended to require the tribunal to investigate US based pharmaceutical companies. Ms Justice Lindsay ruled that it is not part of her terms of reference to investigate the activities of US based companies. The Minister and the Attorney General are examining the position. As Deputy Quinn stated, the tribunals of inquiry Acts would have to be changed. First, it must be decided whether that is possible or necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On 7 May the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, in response to correspondence from Mr. Brian O'Mahony, the chairman of the Irish Haemophilia Society, confirmed <i>inter alia</i> that the tribunal would investigate the sources of the infections, whether arising from BTSB produced products or imported ones. This was before the tribunal proper was established. It is clear from this letter that the intention of the then Minister for Health and Children was to include reference to products produced abroad and I am sure it was written in good faith. In light of what the Taoiseach has just said, what we now know and having regard to the stated position in 1998, will he formally give a commitment to the House that the terms of reference of the Lindsay tribunal will be extended to investigate products that have come from abroad and in particular the data contained in the depository in Pensecola Florida, which, according to yesterday's programme, points to considerable <Col N="1019" /> hard evidence to the effect that the contamination arose from imported products? It is essential that we get a clear commitment from the Taoiseach in light of the knowledge that the Department of Health and Children already has with regard to the need to investigate products coming from abroad.</P>

I asked him last Thursday if he would indicate which legislation would come first, the relationship of the two batches of legislation to each other and the consistency of either or both with the ECHR. What he has said this afternoon does not clarify whether what has been progressed and discussed with the Whips is the legislation required for the ratification of the international covenants or whether it is different legislation that arises in the Council.

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has given notice in writing that he wishes to make a personal explanation. I have decided to permit the personal explanation by the Minister and it should be heard without comment or intervention of any kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a personal statement under Article 43 of Standing Orders.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil last Wednesday evening I stated in response to a question from Deputy Jim O'Keeffe that there was no record in my Department's Passport Office that passports were issued to a named individual and his family. This issue had arisen earlier in the day at the foreign affairs committee when Deputy O'Keeffe had asked me to check out the position. I was very happy to do so and urgently contacted my officials to ensure that every possible effort was made to enable me to give as much information as possible to Deputy O'Keeffe later that evening in the House.</P>
      <P>I made the statement on Wednesday evening in good faith, on the basis of information supplied to me by my officials. I learned subsequently, however, that a more extensive search of the Passport Office records on the following day revealed that passports were issued to this group on 8 December 1990. All the passports expired on 8 December 2000. Consequently, the question of revoking them, which was also raised by Deputy O'Keeffe, does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I was misinformed on Wednesday evening is that the name given to me by the Deputy and subsequently used to search the Passport Office database was spelt incorrectly and therefore was different from that under which the <Col N="1023" /> records were stored. The Passport Office computer system is relatively old and has limited search possibilities. The entire system will be upgraded as part of the automated passport system project which it is hoped to commence in the near future.</P>
    <P>The normal method of querying the passport database is to enter the name and date of birth of the person in question. In the absence of a date of birth, the spelling of the name entered must match the spelling of the name in the database exactly. In this case, the officials had no dates of birth and so the search was conducted on the basis of the name only. As a result, the search of the records did not reveal any record of the relevant passports having been issued.</P>
    <P>However, when checking the phonetic version of the name during the more extensive search of the records on the following day, the true position was discovered. For the information of the House, all the passports expired on 8 December 2000.</P>
    <P>In an effort to provide information to the Deputy at the earliest possible opportunity, I regret that I conveyed inaccurate information to the House and I am very appreciative to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me this opportunity to correct the record.</P>

    <Title>Ordnance Survey Ireland Bill, 2001  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed change in the status of OSI will be an important event for its staff. Because of this, the Minister for Finance met staff representatives very shortly after the Government decided to draft the Bill to discuss its general content and to listen to their concerns. The response of the staff associations was welcoming to the idea of setting up the Ordnance Survey as a State body. Shortly after the Bill was published, OSI staff representatives had a meeting at official level to discuss a number of issues of concern to them. During the intervening period, updates on the status of the Bill were regularly conveyed to staff representatives at local level within OSI and following publication of the Bill, the management of OSI made arrangements through the local departmental council and a series of information seminars to inform all staff, not only in Dublin but also in the regional offices, on the content of the proposed legislation as well as to discuss issues arising from it. Accordingly, OSI staff are fully aware of the Bill's provisions as they affect them and of all other matters in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations on a wide range of issues of concern to staff are taking place with their representatives to try to ensure a smooth transition to OSI's new status. These negotiations should be helped by the staff's awareness that the ability to <Col N="1024" /> exploit the considerable commercial possibilities open to OSI depends on having the freedom of continuing to adapt to changing technological and user needs and that this can only be achieved outside a Civil Service framework.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to say at this point that the OSI's headquarters in the Phoenix Park and the operation of OSI's six regional offices, which are located in Cork, Ennis, Longford, Kilkenny, Sligo and Tuam, are not mentioned in the Bill and are therefore not affected by it. The Phoenix Park premises are acknowledged not to be ideal for a modern mapping organisation, largely because the mapping production process is spread out between several separate buildings. The question of the relocation of OSI's headquarters in the Phoenix Park will, however, be decided on in the context of the Government's decentralisation programme.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the staff of OSI has achieved the complete transformation of all aspects of map-making through continually adopting the latest mapping technology over many years and has brought OSI to a point where it now has the potential for a dramatic expansion of and improvement in the range of products and services which it can provide to its customers. The achievement of this potential depends on the staff of OSI giving their strong support for the proposed new structure. I am confident that this support will continue to be given.</P>
    <P>I will now outline for the House the more important provisions of the Bill. Section 3 formally establishes a new body, to be known as Ordnance Survey Ireland, separate from the Civil Service which will have its own powers. Section 4 sets out in detail the functions that are to be performed by the body. The OSI's general function is to provide national mapping services for the administrative, legislative and infrastructural and other needs of the State. The OSI will be the national mapping service in the State and it will operate in the public interest by creating and maintaining the definitive national mapping and geographical records of the State. In other words, the Bill provides that OSI's traditional role for the last 177 years will continue. Among the tasks that OSI will have to carry out in fulfilling its functions are the maintenance of the physical infrastructure to support mapping applications; creating and maintaining consistent mapping databases; advising the Government on mapping issues; providing technical support to the chief boundary surveyor; depicting Irish language place names as advised by An Coimisiún Logainmneacha, which is now part of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands; and protecting Government copyright on all OSI data. This section also places a general duty of care on the new body to conduct all its business, both commercial and non-commercial, in a cost-effective and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 allow the Minister for Finance to give general policy directions to OSI and to confer additional functions on OSI. Section 7 <Col N="1025" /> allows OSI &ndash; with the consent of the Minister &ndash; to establish by itself or with partners subsidiary companies with limited liability when engaging in commercial activity. It is a key element of the Bill that the OSI, when engaging in commercial activity, does so through subsidiary companies with limited liability set up under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999. In addition, any necessary capital will not come from the public purse &ndash; instead, it will be raised in the marketplace by reference to the commercial merits of the project concerned. There are two main advantages to this approach. The first is that the Exchequer's liability in potential loss-making situations is limited. The second advantage is that, by keeping commercial activity separate from national interest mapping activity, cross-subsidisation from the Exchequer is avoided.</P>
    <P>Section 8 allows the OSI to hold and dispose of shares or other interests in a company with the consent of the Minister and section 9 allows the OSI or any subsidiary to borrow money, subject to any limit the Minister may set.</P>
    <P>Section 10 gives OSI staff powers to enter private lands and premises in connection with the carrying out of its functions. It also authorises OSI to place survey marks on any land or premises for the purposes of supporting the national grid or geodetic or height frameworks. Where an authorised person is prevented from entering lands or premises when carrying out OSI's functions, there is provision in the Bill for a warrant to be obtained from the District Court to allow the required access. Obstruction of a member of OSI staff in the exercise of his or her powers under the section will be an offence, as will the intentional destruction or removal of an OSI survey mark. A person found guilty of an offence under this section will be liable on summary conviction to a fine.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 to 13 provide that there shall be a board of Ordnance Survey Ireland and that members may be remunerated out of funds at the disposal of OSI. These sections also contain provisions in relation to the appointment of a chairperson and ordinary board members as well as to the meetings and procedures of the board.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the appointment of a chief executive officer of OSI. The chief executive officer will be appointed by the board and will hold office subject to the terms and conditions that may be determined by the board, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. The chief executive officer will be responsible for the staff, administration and business of OSI. He or she will be the person charged with the day-to-day running of the new OSI and the carrying out of its functions under the Bill and will be answerable to the board. The chief executive officer will be responsible for the propriety of OSI's accounts and the economic and efficient use of its resources and will be answerable to any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas set up to examine its affairs.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 to 17 set out the provisions for the transfer of staff from the Civil Service to the new <Col N="1026" /> body. There are three important elements to these provisions. The first is that staff of the Ordnance Survey will all transfer to the new body on establishment day. The second is a guarantee that the terms and conditions relating to employment tenure and pay will not be less favourable in the new body than those prevailing before the changeover date. The third is a guarantee that the terms and conditions of any superannuation scheme for the staff of the new body will not be less favourable than those prevailing before the changeover date.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 to 22 provide for the disclosure of interests by staff, members of the board of OSl and directors of a company which has been set up as a subsidiary of OSI.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that the Minister may make an agreement &ndash; called a &ldquo;service agreement&rdquo;&ndash; with OSI which will deal with the performance of its public functions. This is a key element of the Bill. The service agreement will set out in detail the range of activities OSI will carry out in the public interest and the amount of the subsidy from the Exchequer for doing so. Apart from ensuring that OSI will perform its public interest tasks, another important benefit of the service agreement is that, by clearly identifying these tasks, it will also prevent the cross-subsidisation from the public purse of any commercial activity of OSI.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for the keeping of accounts and the conduct of audits of the financial accounts of Ordnance Survey Ireland. Responsibility for the accounts rests with the chief executive officer. These accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the auditor's report will be laid before the Oireachtas. Section 28 provides that OSI will make an annual report to the Minister. Section 30 expressly allows OSI to charge for its products and services. Sections 32 to 36 deal with the dissolution of the existing Ordnance Survey and the transfer of assets, liabilities, contracts and pending legal proceedings to the new body.</P>
    <P>The Ordnance Survey was established in 1824 to provide a national mapping service. The operational environment has changed dramatically in recent years and there now is a need for Ordnance Survey Ireland to become a more clearly focused business organisation, while at the same time continuing its public service role. This Bill allows the OSI to build on the strengths it already possesses and gives it freedom to operate with a more commercial focus while ensuring that it continues, with the appropriate public interest safeguards, to create and maintain the definitive national mapping and geographic records of the State.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. The Ordnance Survey has a very proud tradition, having been established 177 years ago in 1824, and has served this country remarkably well. The dedication of the staff &ndash; in <Col N="1027" /> the early stages providing maps which were designed by hand and may well be described as works of art &ndash; has changed in the interim years in that machinery and technology have moved forward and map-making is now a much more advanced technology. Perhaps the old skills are not as useful as they were in the past, but nonetheless the Ordnance Survey continues to provide a very valuable service.</P>
      <P>Mapping is an important part of the development of a country and Ordnance Survey has played a vital role in providing maps in Ireland. The maps and the surveying done over the decades, and in some cases more than a century ago, still stand to the good and are a valuable record. The various landmarks, archaeological sites, etc., were all recorded on those Ordnance Survey maps and they are treasures from the past.</P>
      <P>Ordnance Survey maps still play a vital role. If one seeks planning permission in any part of the country, one must provide an Ordnance Survey map indicating the site, etc., and that plays an important role in the granting of a planning permission. Ordnance Survey maps also play an important role in the system of agricultural income supports for farmers, where, for area aid, maps must be produced showing the outline of their holdings and those are plotted on master maps to make sure there is not duplication. The staff of the Ordnance Survey do a tremendous job and we must commend them for it.</P>
      <P>The Ordnance Survey's work on the archaeological front was its greatest contribution to the country, where it mapped our ancient monuments, indicated where they were and in many cases provided valuable information which prevented those archaeological sites from being destroyed.</P>
      <P>As a youngster, I recall a schoolmaster who was very interested in ordnance survey. He was fascinated by the various indications of elevation above sea level. Benchmarks had a different meaning in those days and he took great pride in asking students to find out where the benchmarks were in their area, in showing them marked on the maps, etc. There was a benchmark &ndash; a little flat piece with three legs &ndash; carved into the stone on the side of the Christian Brothers house and, in an act which in more modern times might be described as defacing an item of public interest or public monument, he went to the trouble of painting it white so that students would notice it and wonder what it was. It is still there to this day, painted in the way he painted it. It was an important indication of sea level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of those indicators which were put in place by the Ordnance Survey in the past are disappearing and it is now more difficult to find those marks. I noticed recently that the wall on which one of the benchmarks which this old teacher pointed out to us no longer exists. I do not know whether there is an obligation on the people concerned to replace the wall and whether <Col N="1028" /> there is a benchmark at the required level. Are there regulations governing the removal of these items? Is someone checking whether they existed and is it controlled and regulated?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a lot of regulations and laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been rapid changes. The computerisation of maps has made a great difference to the provision of services which can be provided a great distance from where the information is stored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In case I misled the Deputy, when I said there are a lot of regulations and laws I was not referring specifically to the Ordnance Survey, but to a wider issue. It does not arise under the Ordnance Survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the huge demand for existing services such as maps for area aid, extensification, farming, archaeological and planning purposes, the Ordnance Survey still has a need for State subsidy. This is something which must be borne in mind when establishing the Ordnance Survey as a separate body.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the fact that the Ordnance Survey's greatest resource is its staff. In making changes relating to the Ordnance Survey how the staff will be affected must be a primary concern. The Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Jim Mitchell, and I had volumes of correspondence from individuals and trade unions in regard to the treatment of staff who will be affected by the change in status of the Ordnance Survey. Just before I came to the Chamber I received a telephone call from my colleague, Deputy Belton. As the Minister of State will be aware, there is an Ordnance Survey office in Longford and the Deputy is very familiar with the staff there. There are major concerns among the staff in Longford regarding their future &ndash; I received a telephone call from a member of the staff today. In his speech the Minister of State said on numerous occasions that the staff were the greatest resource. He stated as follows:</P>
      <P>The achievement potential depends on the staff of the OSI giving their strong support for the proposed new structure. I am confident that this support will continue to be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am hearing from the staff currently working in the Ordnance Survey is that they have major concerns. They believe they have not been included in the negotiations and discussions on their future and have various concerns about what will happen to them. Some concerns are based on the fact that up to now they have been civil servants. As civil servants they had the opportunity of interdepartmental promotions, transferring from one Department to another and the security of being civil servants which they enjoyed and was a great benefit. However, under the Bill they will lose their Civil Service status. <Col N="1029" /> They will no longer have an opportunity to transfer to other Department on promotion or otherwise. Neither will they have the security which they have had up to now. They will not even have the same possibility for promotion, which is a major concern. I am very disappointed that staff members and trade unions have used such strong language in regard to how they have been treated. I will quote from a letter from Mr. Peter Nolan, Assistant General Secretary, IMPACT, to Deputy Michael Noonan on 6 September which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Union has been supportive of the broad thrust of the Bill. However, serious concerns have arisen regarding the failure of the Minister and his officials to honour commitments given to all Unions on consultation.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>As stated, the Union has from the outset been supportive of measures to improve the commercial focus of O.S.I. The exclusion of the provision for directly elected Worker Directors is viewed with alarm by the Union and staff. The Union's belief is that this is a calculated omission.</P>
    <P>He continues in that vein. He also wrote to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on 6 April stating as follows:</P>
    <P>Understandably, the Union's primary concern is to guarantee the conditions of employment of its members and recognises that the legislation provides some protection in this regard for members. However, the Union is clearly of the belief that consultation with Unions has not been adequate in the matter.</P>
    <P>He then goes on to refer to meetings that were set up, including one which was cancelled at short notice. The message which seems to be coming through from the staff of the OSI is that there has not been proper consultations or negotiations in regard to their concerns, which concerns me.</P>
    <P>In recent days I received correspondence from IMPACT enclosing a synopsis of interim returns for the Ordnance Survey Ireland questionnaire. OSI staff who are members of IMPACT received a questionnaire asking a number of simple questions &ndash; one could say they were leading questions. When asked did they wish to retain their individual Civil Service status 137 members answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; while there were two spoilt votes. An overwhelming majority wish to retain their Civil Service status. When asked did they agree with the decision to change the status of the OSI, 27 answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; while 114 answered &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  When asked had they been significantly involved in the change of status programme &ndash; this is an issue about which the Minister of State might be able to do something at this late stage &ndash; 135 of 144 members said they were not significantly involved in this issue. They believe this is being done over their heads, which is a very poor start to the establishment of this new body. It is bad <Col N="1030" /> from a public relations and OSI point of view, for inter-staff relations and will not get the new body off on a good footing. The Minister of State has an opportunity to do something about this. When members were asked had their views been sought on the change of status, 133 out of 144 answered &ldquo;No.&rdquo; When asked did they want the Dublin office to remain in the Phoenix Park &ndash; just Dublin members were asked that question &ndash; 64 said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and four said &ldquo;No.&rdquo; That is more or less the result of the survey.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has a lot of questions to answer. I hope when summing up he will respond to the concerns of the staff, the major one being loss of Civil Service status. What guarantees can he give the staff? Will they be able to transfer to other Departments in the future or will they be stuck with the OSI? If they will be stuck with the OSI, what guarantee can the Minister of State give them that they can transfer to other Departments beforehand if they wish to do so? I hope he will be in a position to give firm commitments in regard to that issue.</P>
    <P>On the question of decentralisation, everyone agrees the premises in the Phoenix Park is not very satisfactory in terms of facilities for the OSI. Perhaps the building can be improved or another building found. The staff are concerned that the Minister of State in his speech said the question of the relocation of the OSI's headquarters in the Phoenix Park will, however, be decided on in the context of the Government's decentralisation programme. How does this tie in with the OSI moving away from the Civil Service and becoming a separate State body? If the OSI is a State body, how can the Government state it is at arm's length from it, that the staff are not civil servants, but it will move them? Perhaps they could be moved to Castlepollard, County Westmeath, or Caherciveen, County Kerry. The staff are concerned that they could be moved just like that. As indicated in the survey, staff in the Dublin office overwhelmingly wished to stay in that office. Under this Bill OSI will become a State body, following which employees will not then have the option of transferring to other Departments. What will the Minister say to the 64 people currently working in the Dublin office? It is not fair to treat staff in that way and I hope the Minister will address this issue.</P>
    <P>Other concerns of staff relate to the viability of the new OSI. There seems to be a rumour among staff that there will be a reduction in staff numbers of perhaps up to one third. If that happens when the new body is established, will staff have the option of voluntary redundancy or be forced to take compulsory redundancy, or will they get the option of transferring to a Department? I ask the Minister to examine this issue and what will happen if it arises.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the various offices around the country would remain, but can he guarantee that they will remain for good? It is not so long ago since those offices were established. I remember the office being set up in Longford <Col N="1031" /> and many people who were previously commuting to Dublin were glad. If such offices closed, how could employees continue to rear families in the area? Ways of overcoming such a development must be examined.</P>
    <P>Other people have raised a number of items of concern. The new body will not be fully commercial but will receive a subsidy from the State, which I welcome. The OSI does an important job and is worthy of subsidisation from the State. Nonetheless, we must be careful in terms of the level of subsidisation so as to ensure the OSI can do its necessary and very valuable work. We must continue to make and upgrade maps and include new developments as they occur. It has been pointed out to me that many maps have been unrevised for decades, which surprised me. For example, the most recent OSI maps for the Aran Islands are dated 1899 and they are still used for land transfer, planning permission, agriculture, REPS, area aid etc. Many of the new roads being built are not on the maps and the scale of the maps is not suitable for modern day works. I believe the same applies to many areas along the western seaboard. In the past OSI received substantial amounts of money from the State and was in the process of revising maps, and the concern is whether this process will continue. Will maps for the Aran Islands and many other parts of the country continue to be updated at the same pace? The Minister should give commitments in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another point made to me about section 4 relates to maps of prisons, Army barracks etc. In the past those maps were not made available to the public and I wonder if such provision will be built into the Bill. Is it necessary to include a specific section stating that the protocol under which the public could not have access to such secure areas will continue?</P>
    <P>There are concerns about the transfer of staff to other Departments and the apparent breakdown in communication between staff, the Department and the Minister in negotiating this package. I ask the Minister to get his finger out in this context and to talk to the staff and their representatives. Perhaps he should even visit regional offices and hear at first hand the concerns of people. It is only by doing this that he can win over people. He must give them the necessary assurances so as to ensure this new body will have the support, trust and confidence necessary to get off the ground. It will not be an easy change for staff and I hope the Minister will take up the suggestions I have made.</P>
    <P>It is normal in State bodies to have worker directors on boards. However, there is no such provision in this Bill. In addition, the number of directors, varying from four to nine, seems restricted and perhaps the Minister should re-examine this section.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the remit of OSI in terms of place names, which play a very important role. There are fantastic names on townlands through<Col N="1032" /> out the country which carry with them a wealth of history. In the past people made studies of particular areas with interesting place names, which carry with them a tremendous amount of heritage. Unfortunately, the use of place names is dying out, particularly in urban and built up areas where there are new housing estates. Some housing estates are given the most appalling and totally inappropriate names. In my area there is the townland of Robinstown and a developer called an estate he built there Sherwood Park. Maybe he was thinking of Robin Hood, but it leaves a lot to be desired. OSI has a tradition in terms of naming places and townlands, and perhaps the Minister will consider a voluntary body to look at place names and names for housing estates. We try to do it on a local basis, but it is not very effective as we do not have the necessary clout. I am sure the Minister will hear from Members some appalling names of housing estates which bear no relation to Ireland or the wealth of local history. We should try to put in place some mechanism so that names such as Sherwood Park do not arise and that more thought and consideration is given to naming estates.</P>
    <P>Modern ordnance survey maps show ESB lines, high tension cables etc. However, much of that cabling is now being put underground in ducts and I wonder if that ducting will be marked on OS maps in future. Fibre optic cables are also being laid throughout the country and it is important that they appear on OS maps. Perhaps OSI will bear this in mind. It might also be necessary to bring forward a regulation to ensure that provision is made for a comprehensive approach to the installation of ducting. There is hardly a street in this city which is not being ripped up for ducting of some description. Can we introduce a provision to ensure that sufficient ducting is put down which will last for a considerable time when the streets are initially being dug up? It is particularly important that we incorporate ducting into our new major roads and bridges.</P>
    <P>A ridiculous situation arose recently when fibre optic cables were being brought across the River Shannon in Athlone. The bypass around Athlone is only about ten years old and the road had to be dug up to facilitate this project as ducting had not been provided. Taxpayers have paid a huge amount of money for the provision of such amenities and it is ridiculous that there was no forethought in terms of including ducting to ensure traffic is not disrupted again. Those are issues he should review and respond to on Second Stage. Our party welcomes the general thrust of the Bill and the establishment of the OSI as a semi-State body. However, we have reservations, particularly concerning the guarantees and commitments being given to the staff, and will bring forward a number of amendments on Committee Stage to deal with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the useful things about a Bill of this kind is that it allows us the opportunity to shine the light on a section of the public <Col N="1033" /> service on which not much light has been shone in recent years. As the Minister of State and Deputy McGrath pointed out, this is the first opportunity the House has had to discuss in a legislative context the activities of the Ordnance Survey.</P>
      <P>I associate myself with the remarks of the Minister of State and Deputy McGrath about the work done by the Ordnance Survey during the years. It has performed an extremely useful function in providing maps for a variety of purposes, including leisure, tourism, guiding people around the country, planning, etc. From my background as a solicitor I am aware that it has provided maps, which have been of use in land transfers. This was not always done as promptly as some might have liked, but I know systems have improved in recent years.</P>
      <P>That is the point of the Bill. As technology has improved, we now look at things in a different way. Whereas previously it was necessary to draw maps, now computerised models generate maps. I was fascinated by some of what the Minister of State had to say in that regard and what people in the Ordnance Survey have told me about the global mapping that is now possible working from satellite. This has almost Big Brother type implications, but clearly we welcome the march of progress in that regard.</P>
      <P>In that context, it was inevitable that we would look at the structure and purpose of the OSI. From the outset I acknowledge that my party leader, as Minister for Finance, had a role in the decision in 1997 to establish the interim board under Mr. Bonner to consider the future structure of the OSI. On speaking to him in recent weeks he felt there needed to be greater commercial opportunities for the OSI. Currently less than 10% of the OSI's total activity could be termed commercial and there must be scope to increase it.</P>
      <P>This falls neatly into what I would like to see happening in commercial semi-State bodies. We have to preserve the public service element, but also allow them to become involved in commercial activities producing products that can be sold to the private sector. This can be for tourism, for people who want to walk in the mountains or who want to sell or exchange land. There is a role in the commercial sector, which has not previously been exploited and which needs to be exploited now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it necessary to change the status of the OSI to do this? I confess to being almost agnostic on this. It would have been possible to do so while retaining the public service element of its operations within the Civil Service. Having read the Bill carefully I notice the potential structure to establish subsidiary companies to deal with commercial activity. It was not imperative that the remaining section of the OSI had to come out of the Civil Service. I am not saying it is wrong, but it was not necessary. I am aware that it was driven by the report of the interim board which felt strongly that being within the Civil Service was holding the Ordnance Survey back. I am sorry <Col N="1034" /> that people believe that should be the case, but I appreciate that was the finding and view of the interim board and in common with the workforce, I am willing to go with it.</P>
    <P>The trade union representing most of the workforce has been told that Government envisages the vast bulk of the work done by the Ordnance Survey will still be public work. Up to 90% of the work will fall within the non-commercial sector. That is disappointing. It should have been possible to expand beyond that relatively low level. The Minister of State needs to tell us more about the economic modelling and other work which has been done to explore possibilities for commercial activity within the Ordnance Survey. The primary purpose of the Bill was to expand this commercial activity. If we do not do this, we acknowledge from the start that the primary purpose of the Bill is not likely to be met satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath comprehensively dealt with concerns of the staff; I wish to amplify some of them. There has been concern about the consultative process. Members of the House &ndash; not just Deputies Mitchell, McGrath and me &ndash; have been approached by individual workers in the Ordnance Survey and also by the trade union representing most of them. They were not happy with the consultative process.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has gone to great lengths to spell out what was done in an effort to consult with people and I am aware that occasionally it is necessary to reach the brink before people take in all that is said. However, clearly there is a problem. Much of the workforce did not take in what was being said.</P>
    <P>The survey results read out by Deputy McGrath are quite striking. I accept they cover only about two thirds of the workforce, but the bulk of those who responded said negative things. They said they did not want their status or that of the OSI changed; they did not believe they were involved in the change programme, etc. All that is pretty damning and is reflected in the IMPACT press release last week, which is considerably more negative than the position the union previously took. For example, IMPACT states the change in status proposed in the Bill is unlikely to achieve its stated aim of making the Ordnance Survey more commercial. Instead the union fears a hidden motive to pare down operations with a corresponding decline in services, jobs and career opportunities. If this were the case, it would be a pretty damning indictment.</P>
    <P>My first and so far only exposure to the OSI was during the unfortunate industrial relations problems of recent years, with which the Minister of State is familiar. At one stage we had an Adjournment Debate on the issue. I will not get into the merits of that now, but the Minister of State knows that considerably soured relations within the Ordnance Survey for a period. It is still not entirely resolved and some of the bad feeling from that series of incidents is still sadly there. It is in that context that we must look at the con<Col N="1035" /> sultative process that has taken place since. Regardless of however satisfied the Minister of State and the Department are with the process, unfortunately the workforce as represented by its union or by contacts made by individuals to me, believes it was not satisfactory. That is not a good sign or a good way to start this change.</P>
    <P>I come to the financial aspects and particularly the way the Bill siphons off the public service elements from the rest. I am unclear of the extent to which the subsidiary company or companies will be independent of the main body. Will they, in effect, be entirely separate commercial outlets? Will they be able to define a role for themselves? Will that role be defined for them by the Minister of State, giving one of his general policy guidelines? Will they, in effect, be independent companies operating entirely for themselves, retaining their profits and making commercial decisions on a day-by-day basis independent of&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not unhappy with that structure but it is important that it should be spelled out. It may, in turn, have implications for people working for one of the subsidiary companies and perhaps the Minister of State can clarify whether their status is guaranteed as set out in the legislative provision before us. Will they continue to retain the superannuation benefits and so on that are set out in the Bill and will they benefit from the guarantees set out in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State will know, there is particular concern about the regional offices and the office in the Phoenix Park. I have not been to the Phoenix Park office so I do not know what it is like. I have heard fairly negative stories about it. On the other hand, it does not surprise me that people who are used to working in a particular place want to remain working there. I will not tell the Minister of State that he should not change, move or refurbish it but there is a policy issue concern as to whether regional offices should be retained. I am not sure that I would take as sanguine a view as that taken by Deputy McGrath of what the Minister of State said in his contribution. My understanding of what he said is that no decision is made in the Bill one way or the other, and I did not take it to offer the degree of comfort Deputy McGrath seemed to think it contained. The Minister of State might explicitly <Col N="1036" /> address the question of whether he sees a role for regional offices. I realise some offices employ a relatively small number of people but it is important that those people know whether they are to stay in the centres where they currently work or are to be decentralised in another location.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Ordnance Survey Ireland is not the only State body suffering from a measure of insecurity. It is unfortunate from its point of view that the whole argument and the business of decentralisation should intersect with this change of status because, in effect, it is mixing two different elements which should not be mixed. Nonetheless, if one were working there one would feel entitled to be told where one's job will be located and where one will be working in a year's time. One would also like to be told that one will actually have a job in a year's time. I accept that the Bill guarantees a status and the terms, but if the company is restructured in a way where individuals do not have a job, there is more than one way of effectively obliging somebody to take up their bags and go. I am aware that IMPACT, in particular, is concerned that it would be possible to reduce the workforce from its current 250 to perhaps in the region of 150 &ndash; there are suggestions and rumours within the office about that. Perhaps the Minister of State will tell us if he envisages that the new body will carry out a redundancy scheme. I presume he will confirm that that would be voluntary. Perhaps he will also confirm that people in those circumstances would be entitled to transfer to within the service because that is of some importance to people.</P>
    <P>The issue of worker directors has been exercising the minds of some of the membership. I do not understand where the Department and the Minister of State are coming from on this issue. I understood that the principle of appointing worker directors to semi-State companies was long since accepted. Even during the tenure of this Government, I am aware that new bodies set up have had worker directors or worker representatives on them. I suspect, as I tend to do in these circumstances, the hand of the Minister for Finance and his particular ideological vent in these matters. Perhaps he will take the opportunity to confirm that my suspicions in this regard are not justified. Four plus one would make up a very small board. Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate the number he envisages will be on the board. Obviously, we would wish to see, and on Committee Stage we will seek to include, an appropriate number of worker directors.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath raised an issue during the course of his final remarks which I had not thought about but which is of some importance in Dublin and will be, I suspect, of increasing importance in future years, that is, the business of underground mapping. This city is criss-crossed with all measure of utilities and will be, in future years, criss-crossed by tunnels. That process has already started. The port tunnel is under construction and part of the Luas will be under<Col N="1037" /> ground also. I am aware that as far as local authorities are concerned, they have little or no idea of what is under ground. Some of the sewers etc. have been there since Victorian days, if not earlier. Do we have that information? If not, there is a role for somebody, whether it is Ordnance Survey Ireland or whoever, in putting it together because there is a lot happening down there and we do not seem to be entirely clear as to exactly what is the story.</P>
    <P>On another issue raised by Deputy McGrath, I believe I am right in saying that the Planning and Development Bill gives some powers to local authorities to do something about names. I will not get into the business of naming some of the more awful place names that are in my constituency but it is true that there are some and it is not before time that this should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I support the principle behind the Bill. I support giving a much greater commercial remit to Ordnance Survey Ireland. I am not totally convinced that it is necessary for the main body to be taken outside the Civil Service but, nonetheless, I am willing to trust the judgment of the interim board in that regard. There are serious questions still to be answered which, I hope, will give comfort to the staff in terms of the location of their offices and the permanency of their jobs. If the Minister of State cannot tease out some of those questions today, I hope we will be able to do so at a later stage.</P>

      <P>&mdash;but ordnance survey has a fascinating history in Ireland. Ordnance Survey Ireland has had a reputation for quality since it was established in 1824. It has provided the public with a mapping service for the past 177 years and its maps are widely recognised as the definitive article. The first survey was carried out to calculate areas of townlands for fiscal purposes and the whole island of Ireland was mapped at an unprecedented scale of six inches to the mile. Ordnance Survey Ireland designed some of its own surveying equipment and 2,100 men were used to carry out the survey, which took 20 years. That was a major undertaking at the time and the results continue to be impressive today. A second major survey was conducted between 1887 and 1916 when the whole country was resurveyed at a much larger scale &ndash; 25 inches to the mile. Many of the maps we associate with ordnance survey during the 20th century were derived from this survey and the fledgling Irish State was bequeathed an up-to-date and wide-ranging mapping archive in 1922. I outline that history because it <Col N="1038" /> is important, and the Minister of State in his contribution mentioned a number of items regarding the history of Ordnance Survey Ireland.</P>
      <P>Ordnance Survey Ireland has seen many changes during its lifetime. Its first survey predates the Great Famine and captures a record of the landscape when Ireland had a population approaching eight million. Its new surveys of the past few decades have captured a very different Ireland, where urbanisation and farm mechanisation have altered the landscape dramatically. The technology of surveying and mapping has changed utterly in the latter half of the 20th century. Today's surveys are ten times more accurate and can be carried out at one tenth of the cost.</P>
      <P>Ordnance Survey Ireland has had a close relationship with the military for most of its history, first with the Royal Engineers of the British army and subsequently with the Corps of Engineers of the Irish Defence Forces. That has changed recently and, for the first time in its long history, Ordnance Survey Ireland is now totally civilianised and is preparing to take its first steps into the commercial marketplace.</P>
      <P>Ordnance Survey Ireland's mapping service was originally intended only for administrative functions by central Government but when the public became aware of the importance of the maps during the 1850s, it was decided to make them available to the public also. This continued until the present day and now Ordnance Survey Ireland maps are used in many aspects of modern life.</P>
      <P>The functions of Ordnance Survey Ireland should be to produce and maintain topographic maps to assist infrastructural, social and economic development; to produce and maintain cadastral maps of property boundaries for title registrations; to produce official State maps of electoral and administrative boundaries for Government and commercial uses &ndash; all Members will be interested in that part of its function; to provide and maintain a national framework of survey points to international standards for mapping and scientific use; and to periodically capture a comprehensive record of the national landscape for historical purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future role of the Ordnance Survey should be that of facilitator to ensure the provision of surveying and mapping services via a range of public-private partnerships. This can be done in a number of ways. First, the public and private mapping sectors need to jointly develop a range of service improvements for mapping for clients and members of the public. They should formally agree a separation and responsibility for individual tasks to supply this need. Second, the Ordnance Survey should take a lead role in the establishment of a national spatial data infrastructure to identify and supply a range of mapping related services to optimise use of GIS technology at all levels in society and empower the public and improve decision making. Third, the Ordnance Survey should establish a research institute to conduct and fund research to develop ideas, stan<Col N="1039" /> dards and methodologies to improve its service provision.</P>
    <P>I have been requested by the Irish Institute of Surveyors to raise a number of issues with the Minister of State and ask him to consider a number of amendments. Section 4 deals with the functions of the OSI. Section 4(2)(<i>f</i>) provides that it will &ldquo;represent the State at international level on matters related to mapping and geographic information.&rdquo; This should be amended to clarify what interests the OSI should represent and the paragraph should read that the OSI will &ldquo;represent the State at international level on matters related to official mapping and geographic information.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 4(2)(<i>e</i>) provides that the OSI shall &ldquo;advise the Government, a Minister of the Government, a body established by or under statute and other public sector organisations on matters relating to the policy and practice of survey, mapping and geographic information and on the development of national spatial data infrastructures.&rdquo; This function should be removed by deleting this paragraph and inserting a new one to read: &ldquo;An advisory committee will be established to advise the Government, a Minister of the Government, a body established by or under statute and other public sector organisations on matters relating to the policy and practice of survey, mapping and geographic information and on the development of national spatial data infrastructures. Advisory committee members shall be appointed from the OSI, the Land Registry Office, the Irish Institute of Surveyors and the Irish Organisation of Geographical Information.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 25(1) provides that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; from time to time make an agreement with OSI (a &ldquo;service agreement&rdquo;) that certain tasks shall be carried out, functions performed or standards adhered to in the performance of its functions in the public interest, and such agreement may encompass such other supplementary matters as the Minister and OSI may decide.&rdquo; The Irish Institute of Surveyors proposes that this be amended to provide that the advisory committee, proposed to be established by section 4, shall advise the Minister on the need for and the specifications necessary for surveying and mapping services in the public interest and that these should be put to public tender. I am not sure if the institute has made known its concerns on this to the Minister of State or his officials. I hope he will accept the proposals I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Flynn for sharing his time with me and congratulate the Minister of State for introducing the Bill. While it may be uninteresting, it is very important for rural Ireland. It is significant that the Ordnance Survey is to be established as a State body outside the Civil Service. At present it comprises a Civil Service office under the Department of Finance and it is significant that it has a number of regional offices, one of which is in Tuam in my constituency. There was a great struggle to have that <Col N="1040" /> office established and we faced strong competition from other bigger towns and cities. The office employs a small number of people and is a good example of what a small measure of decentralisation can achieve. More is required.</P>
      <P>Whenever a commercial or semi-State body is established, be it for example An Bord Pleanála, An Post or Eircom, the accusation is made that it leads to an erosion in the powers of Deputies, for example, through the inability to ask Dáil questions. The legislation establishing the Agricultural Appeals Board is another example. In the case of the Ordnance Survey, the Bill will remove some of the restrictions placed on it arising from its Civil Service status. This will enable it to exploit new opportunities and meet the demands of the marketplace.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the staff of the Ordnance Survey. They have progressed from drawing maps by hand to using a modern digital process employing the most advanced technology available. That is welcome. I am always amazed that those using this technology are able to find areas, especially those under farming. This ability to secure more accurate information gives farmers more time to pursue their farming activities, which is also to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to me that officials will cease to be civil servants when they are transferred to a new body. I look forward to the Minister of State's response to these concerns. He has said negotiations have led to agreement on standard conditions that will ensure the terms and conditions of employment will be maintained. Presumably this will cover the question of superannuation benefits about which all employees will be concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the relocation of the Ordnance Survey headquarters and pointed out that its current headquarters in the Phoenix Park are unsuitable. Will he expand on this aspect as well as on the future of decentralisation, which is of huge importance to rural areas? There could be no more suitable body than the proposed OSI to have its headquarters located in a rural area.</P>
      <P>While it is the Government's policy to increase forestry, difficulties arise for those seeking maps to cover specific areas of land. By using new technologies the area aid maps have been very successful in addressing the issue of payments of area aid to the farming community. Will the Minister of State consider using them to deal with the question of forestry grant applications? This would improve the take-up and mean that those planting trees will be paid quickly. There is a delay in the payment of those grants due to mistakes on maps or Ordnance Survey system maps not being able to show the total amount of land planted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue I would raise is one that Deputy McGrath has already mentioned. He referred to the question of mistakes we have made in the past and spoke, in particular, about the Athlone bypass. We did not provide for other devel<Col N="1041" /> opments that would be taking place, such as the broadband network. In Galway there is huge development with new roads through the NRA and local authorities, the Bord Gáis pipeline from the west and ESB pylons. While welcome, they can, in some instances, cause difficulty for landowners and those living in the area. I hope we can get as many of these utilities underground as is possible. It is not always possible, however, and I have met the ESB with my colleagues in east Galway about putting its lines underground. If they cannot be put underground, pylons and lines should be kept as far away from people's houses as possible.</P>
    <P>Group water schemes are another form of rural development where maps are also needed. There has been major development by local authorities and, particularly in County Galway, by voluntary groups. They have taken a great step forward by linking with the regional schemes by using maps. However, there are parts of County Galway where regional pipes and group water schemes are almost on the same road. We have to define where all these water schemes are to go. Using the maps about which we are talking will be very important in doing this. I imagine that when the first group water schemes were begun &ndash; some of the earliest were in County Galway &ndash; maps were very limited. Thankfully, progress is being made and we are linking into the regional schemes as required by EU directive. The new maps we have are of particular help to those pioneers of the schemes who are still putting committees and water schemes together.</P>
    <P>Regarding place names, in many towns people are very disappointed that names sometimes only appear in the English language. If they are in Irish, they may appear in very small print at the bottom of signs. There is a strong campaign to have equal status for the Irish and English versions of street and place names. I hope we will get away from some of the very fanciful names of estates used in the past. I welcome the fact that many new housing estates use Irish names. I notice that many local authorities are using the shortened version of the Irish place name. That is regrettable. For example, the town of Gort in south Galway was always known as Gort Inse Guaire. Now on some of the signs on the way in to that town I see the Irish rendered as Gort. It gets the same name in Irish and English, which does not reflect the history of the town. My own village of Castleblakeney was always known as Gallach Uí Cheallaigh because it was the home of the O'Kellys, the family who gave us the Kellys of the welcome, the fáilte Uí Cheallaigh. It has now been reduced to Gallach. That should not happen and I hope the Minister of State will take up the issue with the Coimisiún na Logainmneacha or the local authorities. I do not know to whom we should address the issue, but for a long time we have done a great disservice to those who live in towns where the full Irish of the past has been reduced.</P>
    <P>Up to 40 recognised walking routes have been established and there is great opportunity to <Col N="1042" /> create more. I hope the Minister of State can investigate the possibility of using the OSI's maps to do this. The walks have been very successful with greater numbers getting involved in walking and many tourists are now coming to avail of the recognised routes.</P>
    <P>When we come to the translation of English place names into Irish it would be a very good idea to have discussions with local historians. We will get a better understanding of the history of towns and villages and their streets by doing so rather than by using a shortened version of the name which sounds something like the English one. I wish the Minister of State every success with the Bill and I am hopeful that the OSI will soon be put on a commercial footing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am sharing my time with Deputy Crawford, but we will not know until he arrives.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Ordnance Survey Bill, 2000. I admit that I am not 100% well read regarding its proposals, but I have been going through the Minister of State's speech. In principle, I take issue with semi-State bodies. The Ordnance Survey of Ireland has been doing an excellent job for a great many years. Some of the speakers across the House outlined the history of the Ordnance Survey and it is appropriate that we congratulate the body for its hard work during the centuries in mapping out the whole country in very difficult times. That it went from a workforce of 2,010 down to about 250 presently shows the progress that has been made in terms of the facilities available for mapping. It has affected many aspects of rural and urban life. It is very important to have proper mapping of areas.</P>
      <P>I do not know that I am in favour of having a semi-State body to do this necessary work. The Government should have decided to either privatise completely or leave the OSI within the structure of the Department of Finance. Unfortunately, looking at the history of our semi-State bodies in recent years in the global economy we see how difficult they have found it to survive. A semi-State body is a half-way house. It is not private. It is still an arm of the State and there is a different attitude. It is expected to be competitive, to have the same attitude as a private enterprise, but there is always that dependence on the State. The semi-State body is aware that in difficult times it can look to the State coffers for funding. It is a point of principle that either the OSI should have stayed within the Department or should have been privatised completely. Obviously, that is not a view expressed by a majority around the House, but it is something worth saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will go ahead as it stands and the Government's proposals have to be considered. A number of concerns have been raised with me by people working in the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. I will raise those issues in a little while, but there is a question I would like to ask first. <Col N="1043" /> Will the Minister of State mention in his Second Stage reply what the proposals are to deal with headquarters in the Phoenix Park and the regional offices? I know the Minister of State referred in his speech to decentralisation and may consider the decentralisation of OSI, if possible.</P>
    <P>There are six regional offices, in Cork, Ennis, Longford, Kilkenny, Tuam and my constituency in Sligo. It is not that they employ a large number of people, but there are still very necessary Civil Service jobs in those areas. Given the change in attitude of OSI and its transition to a semi-State body, the staff are concerned that those regional offices may be closed down.</P>
    <P>There is also much concern among the staff regarding the headquarters of OSI in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. Deputy McDowell referred to the fact that the conditions there are poor. I, no more than he, have never had the opportunity to visit them.</P>
    <P>With regard to decentralisation, I do not know how many of the 250 civil servants are based in the Phoenix Park. I know the numbers of people employed in the regional offices are relatively small. I have no objections, being from a rural constituency, to the notion of decentralisation. I hope the Minister of State is more forthcoming than his senior colleague in the Department of Finance regarding the Government's plans for decentralisation. Great noises were made about it over the past 12 or 18 months. There were 90 applications from different towns throughout the country and there were to be ten locations proposed by the Government. Approaching an election, I do not expect that those tough decisions will be made. Before the Government leaves office and considering the decentralisation of OSI, I recommend highly that it chooses the location of Carrick-on-Shannon in my constituency. It is one of the few county towns in the country that does not have an OSI presence. Otherwise, we will have to wait and I will make that decision myself when Fine Gael is in Government after the next general election.</P>
    <P>The issues that have been brought to my attention by a number of staff in the Ordnance Survey office are worth raising, and the Minister of State may have the opportunity to address them in his Second Stage reply. Obviously, we will have the opportunity to table them as amendments on Committee Stage of the Bill. There is great concern regarding the Civil Service status of the employees and I understand that. Will it be possible for them to transfer to other Government Departments after the change of status if the present OSI employees decide they would like to do so when it becomes a semi-State body?</P>
    <P>Will the option to work from home still be available after the change? Will the option to take early retirement with maximum benefits still obtain because there are a number of staff who have over 20 years service as civil servants? Will they be starting from scratch under the new body <Col N="1044" /> or will they be able to retain the benefits they have? Will it be possible for a time period of five years to be allowed during which an employee of the new entity can opt to transfer to a Civil Service Department and location of his or her choice?</P>
    <P>In the early 1990s, when Customs and Excise staff were being disbanded, a special case was made for them. Vehicle registration offices were set up to accommodate a number of those employees. Will the Minister of State propose something like that? I did not hear anything</P>
    <P>reference to it in his speech.</P>
    <P>Was a feasibility study carried out to assess the viability of OSI to function as a semi-State organisation or is it just one of a number of proposals that have been made to the Government?</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have referred to the use of language. The Minister of State mentioned that part of the brief of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is now being taken over by this new semi-State body. I know it is not part of the role of OSI, but it would be important to try to stop the inappropriate naming of estates. If one visited a provincial town in many parts of the country, one would think one was in California, not Ireland. Estates are given names such as &ldquo;Wonderful Heights&rdquo; or called after sunshine and flowers, rather than the Irish cultural names being adopted. We should try to oppose this trend.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's speech refers to the updating and maintenance of the framework on which national mapping is based and a programme to complete a new mapping infrastructure for rural Ireland in the short term. That is something that needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency because I know from my experience of constituencies in rural Ireland &ndash; outside Carrick-on-Shannon, for example, on the periphery of the town &ndash; the existing Ordnance Survey maps pertaining thereto are over 100 years old. The detail necessary for development is not in the maps. This must be the case for many areas throughout the country. Therefore, I hope the proposal of the Minister will be one of the priorities of the new semi-State body when it is set up.</P>
    <P>The ongoing maintenance and development programme to ensure that urban-rural and tourist and leisure mapping databases are up to date is important. My colleague, Deputy McGrath, referred to this in terms of underground transport. Consider the developments that are taking place in Dublin with regard to Luas and the port tunnels. If this country is to develop in the next 20 years the way it has up to now, we may see other cities, such as Cork, Galway and Limerick, in need of underground services, tunnels and other infrastructural provisions.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the developing market and sales function to ensure that products and services are suitably developed to meet the ongoing and anticipated needs of public and private customers. One would require a mon<Col N="1045" /> opoly for this. I hope that the price structures of the new semi-State body will be competitive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Reynolds for the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to set up OSI as a State body outside the Civil Service. Like Deputy Reynolds I am anxious in this regard. Given that it is very difficult to have questions answered by the National Roads Authority or any of the other semi-State bodies, one has to worry about the fact that the Bill does not clearly indicate that we will be able to ask questions in this House. The rainbow Government initiated this process by proposing the interim board in 1997. It is hard to believe it has taken so long to get this far. After four and a half years, there is still serious concern about the lack of consultation on the future of staff. The fears of staff are clear. There is the loss of Civil Service status and of the option to transfer to another branch of the service. A commitment is sought in accordance with Government policy on decentralisation that no recentralisation should be attempted without prior negotiations with the staff of the office affected. Another important issue is that, in the event of the closure of a regional office, such as Longford which is nearest to my constituency, provision should be made to allow staff to transfer or avail of early retirement.</P>
      <P>Section 15 states that the terms and conditions of employment will be no less favourable than those enjoyed by an employee within the Civil Service. An employee within the service can transfer from the Ordnance Survey to another Department, as has occurred recently in several cases. Will an employee of the new entity, who will not be a civil servant, be allowed to transfer to the Civil Service? This is a crucial issue as far as unions are concerned. If a provision for such a transfer is not written into the Bill, the terms of employment are surely altered detrimentally. This provision must be enshrined in the Bill so that it does not contradict itself. I urge for proper discussions and negotiations with staff representatives.</P>
      <P>Before entering office, the Government parties were clear in their commitment. I remember the Army in Castleblayney was told there would be full consultation before anything would happen. We all know what happened in that case. Some people who do not live far from there are fearful that if the provision I have sought is not written into the Bill, the same type of action could be taken again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Others have referred to their anxiety about offices throughout the country being closed and to the office in the Phoenix Park. I have visited that office on many occasions and have found the staff to be extremely helpful and understood what I needed. There are also a number of regional offices. In case my county of Monaghan is forgotten, I point out that we do not have an Ordnance Survey office, although we did once. We would be glad to see the office in the Phoenix Park <Col N="1046" /> decentralised to Monaghan and I am sure I have the full support of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for that. In current circumstances, Government, Civil Service or semi-State jobs are vital and very important to a region.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the centralisation of mapping of underground cables and such like. I cannot help mentioning this in the context of the Border area which depends on cables coming from Dublin. A digger working in County Louth has on a number of occasions cut off all telephone services to north Monaghan. It is vital the Ordnance Survey or some such group clearly marks out as quickly as possible after installation underground cabling, ducting, gas pipes and such like and that there is easy access to this information, on the Internet or wherever, to those involved in excavation to avoid major mistakes being made.</P>
    <P>We generally equate maps for land and property with the Ordnance Survey but those maps are used not only for legal purposes but also in many other areas of farming, such as area aid, the rural environment protection scheme and so on. Satellites are used to check areas, yet most of the maps available to farmers and others show fields as they were 100 years ago. In areas such as mine, there have been major changes in field structures with the removal of hedgerows and such like. It is important that maps are updated as quickly as possible. The younger generation often do not understand what many of the lines on these maps represent. It is important, given all the funds from Brussels clearly marked towards area structures, that the best possible information is made available and that it is easily accessible.</P>
    <P>Others have mentioned the construction of new roads and changes to the landscape in the areas through which they are routed. I encountered a very difficult situation recently in discussions and negotiations for the placing of a new road in north Monaghan. A house which had been built and lived in for some time was not shown on any maps. I realise this was not the fault of the Ordnance Survey but it highlights the need for the quick updating of maps, especially where people's livelihoods are put at risk.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the new structures being put in place work quickly and at a reasonable cost. Deputy Gerry Reynolds made the point that the danger of the Ordnance Survey being a monopoly cannot be overlooked. We must ensure maps and other necessary items provided by the Ordnance Survey are available at a realistic and reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words. The Bill is necessary and is a step forward, but the Minister should ensure the staff involved are given an opportunity to sort out their problems to obtain a reasonable settlement. Given current circumstances, Civil Service jobs are more important than ever and I would like to see some of them brought to Monaghan.</P>

      <P>There is no question in the legislation of a monopoly being conferred on Ordnance Survey Ireland. There has never been a monopoly in Ireland in the preparation of maps. Anyone is free to prepare a map but the State required maps to be prepared for various purposes. The origins of the Ordnance Survey were in the need for the military to have mapping arrangements. For many years there was a symbiotic link between the Ordnance Survey headquarters in the Phoenix Park and the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding issues I wish to raise on Committee Stage, I welcome as a matter of principle the introduction of this legislation and the interest the Minister has taken in the matter. It is clear the Ordnance Survey staff deserve great praise for the development of their service in the previous two decades. For many decades this service of the State was a most neglected part of State administration and the basic mapping infrastructure inherited from the days of the British was preserved but with little done to improve, enhance or develop it. In the past 20 years we have seen a tremendous development in moving the Ordnance Survey from a producer of paper maps to a provider of geographic data available on databases. As the Minister pointed out in his introduction to this measure, map-making has been transformed from a hand-drawn activity to a digital process employing the most advanced information technology. We have witnessed in the Ordnance Survey office the development of that transition within a rigid Civil Service framework. We have also seen a change in attitude where a commercial approach has been taken to the sale of the various services and products which the Ordnance Survey provides. It is desirable to put the activity of this body on a sound statutory foundation by establishing Ordnance Survey Ireland.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government recognises that it is not a staging post or transitional point on the way to privatisation but that mapping must remain a core activity of the State. That is recognised by the provisions in the legislation which ensure that there must be a service agreement and a continued public subsidy, by way of a substantial subvention from the Exchequer, to enable the Ordnance Survey to carry out its work. It is envisaged that there will be a continuing deficit at the Ordnance Survey. There is provision in the legislation for the service agreement and under the service agreement the public interest services which the Ordnance Survey provides will be clearly identified and paid for from the Exchequer. I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice also that the Minister has been careful to say that this is not a Bill to provide for the decentralisation of the Ordnance Survey. There is no intrinsic link between this legislation and a possible move of the Ordnance Survey. The relo<Col N="1048" /> cation of the headquarters in the Phoenix Park will be decided in the context of the Government's decentralisation programme. A number of Deputies from the other side of the House appealed for the decentralisation of the Ordnance Survey headquarters to their constituency. It is located close to my constituency and the bulk of the staff reside in that constituency. Deputies from outside the greater Dublin area call for the decentralisation of Departments but they often forget that there are few Departments or agencies located in the suburbs or around the periphery of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to recognise that Dublin extends substantially into a surrounding hinterland and while the bulk of the State offices are located in the core central area of the Dublin metropolitan region there are few State agencies located around the periphery of that region. This agency is located on the periphery of the built up metropolitan Dublin region. The Dublin and eastern regions are entitled to expect some measure of establishment of State offices. Many employees wish to work in these offices and to live in the Dublin area. One of the difficulties of decentralisation has been to persuade staff to live outside the Dublin area. There is considerable merit in establishing State offices in suburban Dublin because it will alleviate traffic problems to some extent. I would like this plea on the general question of decentralisation to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I commend the general principles of this measure and the Ordnance Survey on the progress and development made in recent decades and the commitment, interest, enthusiasm and ability of the staff. The question of staff consultation must be looked at with care. The union representing the staff has expressed unhappiness with the nature of the consultation which has taken place to date. The Minister has engaged in detailed discussions with the unions in recent months. It is important that we recognise the concerns staff have about transfer from a Civil Service context to a separate statutory body. The Minister has indicated that it is expected that the usual transitional arrangements whereby transferred staff remain eligible to participate in Civil Service competitions for a period after the establishment day will be agreed. I hope progress has been made on those discussions and that the Minister will be generous and will meet those requirements and other elements put forward by the staff representatives. The staff has been a motivated group and that motivation should be sustained and discussions brought to a successful conclusion before the enactment of the legislation.</P>
    <P>A matter of more general principle is the question of staff representation on the board of the Ordnance Survey. I appreciate that the number of staff is small but I appeal to the Minister to consider whether some form of statutory recognition of the principle can be formulated in this measure. It is important for the Ordnance Survey <Col N="1049" /> that this legislation is enacted. The Ordnance Survey has a clear core function which is recognised in the legislation as being worthy of Exchequer subvention and support. That is welcome. The new legislation will allow the Ordnance Survey to proceed on a commercial basis in relation to many of its operations and is therefore desirable. I thank the House and the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Lenihan for sharing his time. I am probably the only Member who has a principled problem with what is happening here today. The creation of another non-commercial State-sponsored body is hardly new. It is something we have been doing since the 1920s. In 1969, exactly 32 years ago, the Devlin report commented &ndash; the PSORG since commented &ndash; that on each occasion that we create a new non-commercial State-sponsored body when similar or analogous functions are retained within the Civil Service we are admitting that the legislative basis on which the Civil Service is established is too inflexible to meet the needs of a modern society. Specifically, the Devlin report was talking about the doctrine of ministerial responsibility. It suggested that this was central to the organisation and operation of the Civil Service and that it was also the basis of much of the inflexibilities which had to be addressed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis since 1926 when the first non-commercial State-sponsored bodies were created.</P>
      <P>We are doing the same here today without addressing the issue of the general principle. The primary argument for the creation of a stand-alone non-commercial State-sponsored body called OSI seems to be to free the existing OSI from existing constraints. I understand why that is happening. I would like to know the genesis of the suggestion and to hear how it evolved and what basic arguments have been put forward. I listened with interest to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen. His speech was clear and concise but the reality is that 32 years after the publication of the Devlin report we are still doing this sort of thing on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unwise to have certain functions within the Civil Service and others outside in the grey area we call the non-commercial State enterprise area. We have not addressed that issue and we will probably not address it tonight either. It is time we established some general principles as to how we should shape our administration. The Devlin report provided us with a model. Successive Governments over the past 30 years have shirked their responsibilities. We have had a lot of &ldquo;commitment&rdquo; to reforming, re-establishing and refocusing our Civil Service. We have had some extraordinarily good initiatives, for example the SMI initiative, but we have also had failures. The legislation a few years ago which created the title &ldquo;Secretaries General&rdquo; in Departments was supposed to address the wider issue of the structure and focus of the Civil Service in the years ahead, yet it failed to do that. Again we come back to <Col N="1050" /> the <i>ad hoc</i> solution to the problems. The difficulties of freeing OSI are being resolved, as in so many cases previously, by the creation of a non-commercial State-sponsored body.</P>
    <P>I am surprised Members have not indicated any sense of unease in their contributions today. The reality is that on each occasion we create another one of these <i>quasi</i> autonomous agencies, we are hiving off areas of public administration which were previously under the direct control of this House through the doctrine of ministerial responsibility and transferring them to some nether world where a board is supposed to have oversight.</P>
    <P>There is one good aspect of the Bill where the audit system addresses issues of efficiency. I am unhappy that we continue to operate on this basis. As we enter the 21st century, it is time to examine fundamentally the logic of retaining a large section of public administration under the nonsensical Victorian doctrine of ministerial responsibility, when it has been recognised on over 100 occasions since 1927 that this doctrine is unworkable. I commend the Bill if only because it provides the opportunity to raise that issue.</P>
    <P>Like other Members, I was contacted by Ordnance Survey staff, which surprised me. The transmogrification from Civil Service to non-commercial State-sponsored body is a well trodden route. I have every confidence in this process, knowing as I do that the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, is aware of the staff's concerns. I was concerned, however, at the volume of representation made. Deputy Brian Lenihan referred to the usual transitional arrangements, but I suppose it is because of what happened to organisations like Telecom Éireann, which went the whole way from Civil Service to private enterprise, that public servants are concerned. I am confident the Minister will look at this and give whatever guarantees are necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputies also spoke of the OSI headquarters. Long before I became mad and entered politics, I worked in the public service and at that time, 25 years ago, the inadequacies of the OSI headquarters' buildings and the necessity of something new and appropriate to its task were debated. I was amused to hear Members arguing, on the one hand, for its staying in Dublin and others, in the tradition of parochial politics &ndash; all politics is local, as Tip O'Neill said &ndash; for moving it to their constituencies. Not to be remiss in that and to be as parochial as others, I put down a marker for Wicklow. If the Minister is considering moving the headquarters to the periphery, there is no better place than there. It has been overlooked in all decentralisation matters. It is not too far away and many of the staff live there, some in the sylvan territories represented by Deputy Brian Lenihan, others in the uplands. The county would be an excellent compromise. I smiled when Deputy McGrath argued for not moving the headquarters and Deputy Crawford argued the opposite. I sympathise with Deputy Crawford but hope decentralisation will be to Wicklow.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> I remember 25 years ago having conversations with Ordnance Survey staff who were concerned about the treatment of artefacts. The major concern was over lithostones with the original hand drawn maps, which were truly works of art. Tragically, many were destroyed, broken up or even used as paving stones, which was vandalism. No one in OSI today would be guilty of that sin. There are significant artefacts which should be preserved. I have spoken to people in the OSI who are conscious of the artistry and the importance of the early reproductive instruments. There should be guarantees about these. The Ordnance Survey has a colourful history that ought to be preserved. As was said, it flows from military occupation and there was a symbiotic relationship between the military and the early Ordnance Survey.</P>
    <P>I support what Deputy McGrath said about the abnormality and bizarreness of some current place names. This is not a matter for this Bill nor for the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, but for planning legislation, and was mentioned by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. There are some bizarre aberrations of place names. We have marvellous names that relate to the history of the country and its people. Deputy McGrath referred to an estate in Robinstown called Sherwood Park. There are several similar ones in County Wicklow. An effort must be made to force local authorities to require logic in naming new estates. We have a wealth of place names, some beautiful, others bizarre but all worth preserving. Cyber Downs, PC Valley, Airfield Heights and similarly outlandish names are nonsense and cretinous in the extreme. One wonders if the Christian</P>
    <P>Brothers ever got their hands on some of these developers. If they did, they did a bad job. If they are not prepared to do it willingly, then it must be inculcated into that merry band of men called developers that there is a wealth of place names here. Work has been done and there is much official exhortation, but I want to see planning legislation used to force common sense on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i> (Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> My first instinct and reaction is to be extremely suspicious of this Bill and the intention behind it. The explanatory memorandum summarises it as providing for the transformation of the Ordnance Survey into a State body, the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, outside the Civil Service with considerable commercial freedom to enter into contracts and joint ventures and to sell its products and collect debts and royalties. On the face of it, some might think that this is an attractive option designed to enhance the Ordnance Survey into a vibrant State-owned organisation that will flourish and provide a necessary service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However we must take into account the Government's record regarding its attitude towards public services and State and semi-State bodies. The driving philosophy, during four years in power, behind its approach to State and semi-<Col N="1052" /> State sectors is the philosophy of privatisation. Recently, I attended a seminar on Aer Lingus, organised by SIPTU, at which a senior officer of the Department of Public Enterprise, under the tutelage of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, spoke. He left more than me aghast at the simple statement that Aer Lingus had no future in public ownership as privatisation was the only way to go. It was not that the Commission might create a problem when it came to seeking funds from the EU, but that it was not the right thing to do since it should be privatised. That person spoke honestly and, if this is the thinking at the heart of the Department of Public Enterprise, shared by the Minister, what hope is there to develop a vibrant public service or semi-State sector?</P>
    <P>The question, naturally, comes to mind as to whether this Bill is in preparation for the privatisation of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland at a later stage. That is my very great suspicion. We will probably see some combination of parties, whether in the present Government or some other combination further down the road, pushing the situation further in that direction if this Bill is passed. Everything which this Government has done in the past two years in particular provides justification for that suspicion.</P>
    <P>The Ordnance Survey is a unique operation, more than 170 years in existence. I agree it was linked to military purposes but it developed from that to provide a very essential service for the public bodies of this State, the local authorities, the Land Commission and various other bodies, over many years. Indeed, people involved in ordinary transactions such as house purchase will have availed of maps prepared by the Ordnance Survey. If it were positively developed, it could become a very vibrant body and continue to perform a necessary public service. Even the Government recognises that, as indicated in the Minister's speech. It has, in many ways, modernised itself to provide an up-to-date service in mapping and other areas for which it is responsible. However, if this Bill is passed, what will be the position for Ordnance Survey Ireland? </P>
    <P>I have had the painful experience on more than one occasion in the past few years of fighting a rather lone battle for the public services and their development as such, against the philosophy of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government, sometimes aided and abetted by the main Opposition parties. The Government's action in relation to the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, for example, would ring many warning bells about what may happen to Ordnance Survey Ireland later. We had a unique service, a commercially viable oil terminal and refinery which, nevertheless, the Government sold off to a multinational company with, as it happened, an appalling health and safety record and a dreadful environmental record. We have also had examples of commercially viable banks being sold off in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>The Government now proposes to put much of the Ordnance Survey into the realm of the purely <Col N="1053" /> commercial. It recognises, however, that there is part of its work that may not be capable of becoming commercial and may have to be retained as a public interest. It then proceeds to provide for a division between the public interest section and the commercial section of the Ordnance Survey. The Minister said that the general function of OSI will continue to provide the national mapping service in the State and will operate in the public interest by creating and maintaining the definitive maps and geographical information of the State. He then went on to detail the service agreement in regard to what will be carried out in the public interest, containing a description of each such activity etc. and what will be done as a commercial entity. I see a real danger for the future in the proposed structure. If it is put into effect, the result will be a division of the services now provided by the Ordnance Survey, whereby the commercially profitable can be flogged off to the highest bidder and what even this Government sees as essential for the State in regard to the mapping service being maintained as a public service underwritten largely by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister is providing that the commercial sector will be pushed into the marketplace to raise its funds. At a time of very low interest rates, that may not seem very onerous but if, against a background of crisis, we revert to a 1980s situation, when State and semi-State companies were up to their necks in interest payments and severely damaged by that millstone tied around their necks by the banks, by virtue of being forced into the marketplace, it could be extremely difficult for Ordnance Survey Ireland to remain viable in those conditions. We have had semi-State sectors which were massively hampered by debt. The most notorious example, to which I referred in this House on a number of occasions, was the fertiliser company from which the banks made an absolute killing. That situation should not be allowed to develop in relation to the Ordnance Survey.</P>
    <P>There is a particular situation with regard to the staff of the Ordnance Survey service. It is scandalous that, in this State, many semi-State bodies run their operations as mini-dictatorships, in which the industrial relations atmosphere is actually worse than in some capitalist concerns. Workers are treated badly by a sometimes brutal and uncaring management and are often very greatly alienated. There have been many examples of this in the past 12 to 18 months alone. That is outrageous, particularly for a public sector company, which should be a model for how workers are treated, the atmosphere which should prevail in the workplace and, in consequence, the ability of workers to contribute better to the company concerned, by virtue of that good relationship.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing to hear complaints about this situation from constituents working in the Ordnance Survey office. One such letter states that, of late, industrial relations in OSI have deterio<Col N="1054" /> rated, staff are demoralised and, to improve this difficult climate, it is imperative that a signal is given by a statutory provision of worker directors. If this does not happen, it is likely that a continuing downward spiral in industrial relations will immediately affect the prospect of the new body being successful. This would present the new body with an unwarranted legacy which will directly affect the viability of OSI.</P>
    <P>The Minister, if he gets his way with the passing of this Bill, which is likely on the face of it, should move in a different direction and bring the workers in the Ordnance Survey to the very heart of the management of the company instead of providing for a board which might be merely four members, that is, the minimum number provided for. If there was a real commitment on behalf of this or any other Government in regard to a real, imaginative and vibrant development of the public services, bringing workers into the heart of the management of a company at all levels and in all ways would obviously be a crucial factor in how any public company could be developed. In that way, one would utilise the best talents and the best abilities to make the public sector very successful in providing a service second to none to the population it serves and, in many cases, help it to turn in a surplus which could go into redevelopment or into other areas of the public sector. If that had been done in many State companies, such as Aer Lingus or, indeed, Iarnród Éireann, we would have a different scenario from the one we face at present. The Minister, therefore, when replying to the debate should address the concerns of the staff and make provision in the Bill along the lines I suggest.</P>
    <P>Another concern the workers have raised is decentralisation. The Ordnance Survey has been located in the Phoenix Park for 176 years. I fully understand the concerns of workers in the Ordnance Survey service when we see the activities of the Government in recent years in regard to decentralisation. Instead of acting like a Government which has under its leadership the resources and services of the State and which is mandated to develop those equitably and justly in the interests of all the people of the State, in the matter of decentralisation of State services, the Government is degenerating into a pack of rugby players where certain Ministers seize the ball under their control and make off at top speed to the furthest corner of their constituency.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform transferred to Cahirciveen a section of the public legal service. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resource is attempting to transfer to Galway sections of his Department without proper consultation or objective analysis as to where, if these are to be decentralised, the best place in the State is to which they should be decentralised and how the best service could be given rather than the criteria being that the best location, according to the Government, is from where the Minister in charge is elected and located. That is scandalous. It is on a par with <Col N="1055" /> feudal operations rather than the needs of a modern economy and particularly the welfare of public services and the workforce on whom the State and the country depends to provide a service. I fully agree with the staff in their concerns and insist that they are not only consulted, but that the decision is in their hands in this case of</P>
    <P>Ordnance Survey Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised is the pension rights in the changed circumstances of the Ordnance Survey. A number of workers in the Ordnance Survey came from previous services, for example, the Army, and were able to bring their service with them for pensionable purposes. The Minister must reassure the staff that in any changes which may occur as a result of this legislation, they will maintain their full entitlement in regard to their pension rights. We have seen other pensioners rather shamefully treated by previous Governments and decisions they have made. That is a very important point.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Ordnance Survey developed as a vibrant public service. It is wrong that the Minister said that it cannot really be done while maintaining its position as part of the Civil Service. If the will was there and the philosophy was different, it would be possible.</P>
    <P>Tá amhras mór orm faoi intinn an Rialtais maidir leis an mBille um Shuirbhéireacht Ordanáis. An t-amhras atá orm gurb é príobháideadh an chomhlachta úd atá in aigne an Rialtais tamall síos an bóthar, faoi mar a deineadh leis an Irish Petroleum Corporation, comhlacht a bhí riachtanach agus seirbhís a bhí an-thábhachtach don Stát.

      <P>I am puzzled as to what the Minister is trying to do in this Bill. There is no doubt that he has caused a lot of annoyance and turmoil in the Ordnance Survey office. I recognise and place on record the great work of the Ordnance Survey and the important service that has been rendered to this State. No aspect of activity in this country will lead to litigation as quickly as the ownership of a piece of property and the line drawn between neighbours, whether it is a building site, a housing site or the transfer of land. The final arbiter in that very important activity is the Ordnance Survey official and the boundary lines drawn by these people. They have shown commitment and dedication. Work has been ongoing and developments have been made and experience gained. One cannot take somebody from university, bring them to the Ordnance Survey with whatever qualifications they may have and send them to the countryside to do ordnance survey <Col N="1056" /> as they would get lost. These people have vast experience.</P>
      <P>I have a letter from a person who has worked with the Ordnance Survey for 23 years and his rights as a civil servant will be taken away from him overnight if the Minister has his way in this Bill. These people are annoyed. This is one individual but he speaks on behalf of his colleagues. He does not wish to remain anonymous but I will not name him here because I have great regard for him and his colleagues. I have had dealings with these people over the years, as has the Minister and others in this House. If there is any problem in the Ordnance Survey, it is that it has always been understaffed, particularly in recent times. Over the years, things moved slowly.</P>

As the preamble to the Bill states, this legislation seeks to promote and protect the rights of persons with a disability and, in particular, to secure the fair, simple, speedy and efficient resolution of complaints relating to infringement of those rights. It provides for the appointment of a disability commissioner charged with responsibility for a draft code of disability rights and for the promotion, respect for and observance of those rights and the investigation of breaches of the code, among other responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The Bill also seeks to establish important substantive rights &ndash; a right to an assessment of needs and the services which will be required to fulfil those needs. The Bill has been initiated and promoted by the National Parents and Siblings Alliance, and Fine Gael is proud to introduce it to the House and seek all-party support for its enactment. I acknowledge and applaud the initiative and dedication on this and other issues in relation to people with disability which the National Parents and Siblings Alliance and the many children, parents and families who support its work have shown over many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>raison d'être</i> for the Bill and the disability commissioner which it seeks to establish comes from the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities entitled, A Strategy for Equality. An <Col N="1057" /> excerpt from a submission to the commission reads:</P>
    <P>People with disabilities do not want to be pitied, nor do they want their disabilities to be dismissed as of little importance. All that is required is respect and basic needs and basic rights. Surely that is not too much to ask?</P>
    <P>The commission, reporting only a few years ago, concluded:</P>
    <P>People with disabilities are the neglected citizens of Ireland. On the eve of the 21st century, many of them suffer intolerable conditions because of outdated social and economic policies and unthinking public attitudes. Public attitudes towards disability are still based on charity rather than on rights, and the odds are stacked against people with disabilities at almost every turn.</P>
    <P>Rights are what we are attempting to enshrine in law here tonight. The commission report continued:</P>
    <P>Whether their status is looked at in terms of economics, information, education, mobility or housing, they are treated as second class citizens . . . They want, and are entitled to, equality and full participation as citizens.</P>
    <P>That is the background and the culture from which the Bill emerges. I acknowledge that it emerges from frustration at almost five years of promises which have, so far, proved hollow. Unfortunately, we are not in a position to debate, on this or any other evening, a Government sponsored comprehensive disabilities Bill. This vital legislation, promised by Fianna Fail in opposition, has had an extremely long genesis. The</P>
    <P>latest Government legislative programme promises the Bill will be published before the end of this session. I hope the Government will show good faith by accepting this Bill tonight as initial legislation to enshrine these rights in law in the fifth year of the Government's term of office.</P>
    <P>Publication of a Bill is an important milestone, but enactment of a Bill into law may be a long and difficult road. No disabilities Bill has yet been tabled in the House. Here, in the Disability Commissioner (No. 2) Bill, 2001, we have live legislation, which, while not the panacea for all ills, is an honest attempt to address the real needs of people with a disability and move the agenda forward at more than a snail's pace.</P>
    <P>I remind Members that in the aftermath of the Sinnott case earlier this year Government promises came thick and fast. The Minister promised a Disabilities (Education and Training) Bill; where are the plans and the consultation in relation to it? The Minister promised to recruit additional psychologists; how many have been recruited? I was recently told that certain schools must now choose which children to send for assesment, so tight are the opportunities for such assesment.</P>
    <P>The Government announced the establishment of a special needs education forum to contribute <Col N="1058" /> to the elements which will make up the StateWP extended char 4,28s comprehensive response to the needs of people with disabilities. The first meeting was to be held in September 2001. On 9 October 2001 no one has yet received an invitation to participate, yet the Taoiseach has been in Europe espousing his long-term commitment to the issue of life-long learning. It is a bitter irony that he espoused this commitment on 29 March this year, the third day of the State's appeal in the Sinnott case.</P>
    <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium promised much. An extract reads:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats in Government are committed to radical change to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed. Our policy is based on the core principles of promoting empowerment through appropriate, accessible and responsive services.</P>
    <P>Despite these commitments, despite the priority afforded to the needs and rights of persons with a disability in partnership agreements, despite the recommendations of reports such as, A Strategy for Equality, and despite the raising of public consciousness, for people with a disability, for their families, carers and advocates, change is coming about painfully slowly. This point is graphically illustrated by the fact that three years after its publication and acceptance by Government some 80% of the recommendations in the report remained unfulfilled.</P>
    <P>There has been some improvement in the area of legislation such as the Employment Equality Act, 1998, the Equal Status Act, 2000, and the National Disability Authority Act, 1999. These are important milestones, but not enough. The Disability Commissioner (No. 2) Bill, 2001, will give strong additional supports to families and individuals in terms of ensuring their rights are vindicated in Ireland. Some changes are taking place, but the signs of delay and vacillation are clear to see, as examples show.</P>
    <P>In 1999, within three months of the receipt of the Franklin D. Roosevelt award which honoured Ireland for &ldquo;reaching further and doing more&rdquo; for people with disabilities, those people were for the third time in 18 months protesting at the gates of Leinster House because a vital transport service was discontinued because of lack of funds. Some progress has since been made, but this is still a real issue.</P>
    <P>For people with disabilities there is no fully accessible comprehensive public transport system. The United Nations citation for the international award states that Ireland has &ldquo;set the pace&rdquo; and that &ldquo;Ireland has reached farther and done more&rdquo; to advance the cause of people with disabilities. However, the contrast between this international recognition of legislative achievement and the reality of the day-to-day struggle for even the most basic rights in the lives of people with disabilities throws into sharp focus the inherent contradictions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> One of the submissions detailed in the Strategy for Equality report explains the situation as follows: &ldquo;It appears to us that the parents of a disabled child face a lifetime of fighting each and every agency and Department for their rights and the rights of their child.&rdquo; We saw this earlier this year and we see it in current and upcoming court cases. This statement will strike a particular chord with Catherine Sinnott and the many parents who followed the Sinnott case, as with the hundreds of other mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters similarly engaged in the daily fight for the rights of their family members. It will also find a resonance with those people with physical disabilities who find themselves excluded from employment, education or social opportunities by lack of accessible transport, lack of aids or appliances, or lack of personal assistance. These are still major problems.</P>
    <P>I remind the House of certain statistics. As we speak, 900 people with intellectual disability are on the waiting lists for residential services and 600 people with intellectual disability are inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals. Think of the consequences of that. Think of the reality of that, day in day out. It is simply unacceptable and the pace of progress is not fast enough.</P>
    <P>We certainly need a rights culture in terms of basic rights for the disabled. Hundreds of people are in need of day care facilities. Thousands of people with physical disabilities do not benefit from day activity or development. It was very disturbing to read a report some months ago by the Irish Wheelchair Association on the confinement that is the daily lot of many people who are physically disabled. Many feel they are prisoners in their own homes and they do not get the supports to access what many of us take for granted on a daily basis. This legislation concentrates not on what people have, but what they need, basic needs like education, accessible transport, respite care and residential care, aids and appliances.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been lauded for reaching further and doing more. The progress report Towards Equal Citizenship shows that the State is not willing to reach very far. In response to the five separate recommendations of the commission in relation to assessment of needs and the provision of services to address those needs, the Department of Finance issued an outright rejection. According to the report, the Department cannot accept underpinning by law of access to and provision of services for people with disabilities as a right. This right would be prohibitively expensive for the Exchequer and could lead to requests from other persons without regard to the eventual cost of providing these services. This is very serious and has to be questioned. What is the cost of not providing those services to our citizens and can we afford that cost?</P>
    <P>These financially virtuous sentiments are chilling in the extreme and perhaps explain much of the resistance to the Minister being able to bring forward a comprehensive disability Bill. Perhaps <Col N="1060" /> the Minister will enlighten us tonight on who is holding up the disability Bill. What Departments are holding it up and for what reasons? Are we saying that people's rights can be vindicated only if they are cheap. Is it value for money, not quality of life, fulfilment, independence or the achievement of personal goals that motivates legislation? It is, indeed, a challenge to democracy when financial matters become paramount. Are we cynical or responsible? Do we really know the price of everything and the value of nothing?</P>
    <P>The premise for such an argument is roundly dismissed by the evidence of Catherine Sinnott to the Joint Committee on Education and Science just two weeks ago. She said:</P>
    <P>In the context of the basic human right there are no financial considerations. Mr. Justice Barr explained that the financial planners must understand that before any other spending, the constitutional priorities, namely, the basic inalienable human rights, must be supplied and paid for. It could not be more simple . . . There can be no Bertie bowl while anyone is denied an appropriate primary education. Neglect is a false economy.</P>
    <P>The move from the paternalistic, charitable model in relation to people with disabilities to a rights-based approach is inexorable. In his address to the annual human rights forum in Dublin in July of this year, Professor Gerard Quinn of NUI Galway eloquently identified the dangers inherent in the Exchequer-based arguments which he defines as &ldquo;the danger that the public interest might simply be defined as the lowest common denominator.&rdquo; We cannot accept that situation for anyone but we certainly cannot accept it for people with a disability. Professor Quinn questions the power of the marketplace and how it affects those whose issues do not connect up with the permanent priority of economic viability or with other passing policy priorities. He trenchantly champions the move from the welfare model of dealing with people with disabilities to vindication of their rights. It is, he says, very simple. It is about moving away from viewing people as objects to viewing them as subjects, a move away from the view that people are problems to the view that people have rights and that their problems are largely of our making.</P>
    <P>In the context of our response to the atrocities in the US, we have focused in recent days on our responsibilities in relation to UN conventions dealing with military responses to a global threat. This Bill, set in an international context, should highlight our obligations to people with disabilities. The UN Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights deals with the rights of persons with disabilities. The Minister is going to the UN and championing this while at the same time disability legislation is not coming into this House. This covenant states that it clearly requires Governments to do much more than merely abstain from taking measures which might have a <Col N="1061" /> negative impact on persons with disabilities. The obligation is to take positive action to reduce structural disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The covenant also refers specifically to the right to have access to and benefit from those medical and social services which enable people with disabilities to become independent to support their social integration. This is what we are saying should happen at UN level and this is what this Bill is saying should happen in Ireland. We are asking the Government to support this Bill for Irish people at home just as they are supporting it at UN level. Support for the general thrust of this Bill may be presumed in comments made recently by the Director of the National Disability Authority. She described the issue of needs assessment as vital for people with disabilities. This Bill seeks to establish important principles. It seeks to establish rights and, equally importantly, the identification of needs, which must be vindicated and met by our society and we should delay no longer.</P>
    <P>People with disabilities, their families, advocates or carers should not have to spend every day fighting an uphill battle. People should not have to take to the streets or the courts to demonstrate that they have a right to day care, respite care, education and training, and transport, yet we have seen people taking to the streets and organising public meetings within the past few months to try to vindicate those rights. It is no longer acceptable that people have to do that.</P>
    <P>More than 350,000 people in Ireland have a disability. For too long, justifiable expectations of equal access and equal rights have exceeded a less than perfect reality. When rights are acknowledged they must be universally applied. When Ireland received the international Roosevelt award for services to persons with a disability, President McAleese said that &ldquo;while we feel privileged and pleased to be the recipient country, we know that this award carries with it a serious moral obligation to ensure that we maintain and accelerate the momentum for change in disability-related policy and service provision.&rdquo;  Commenting on the consequences of not taking rights seriously in the past, the President said:</P>
    <P>We have failed our people with disabilities and, in the process, seriously damaged our society. How much talent has been wasted because people with disabilities have not been given the opportunities and means to develop their gifts?</P>
    <P>This Bill gives an opportunity for these basic needs to be properly assessed, for the services to be put in place and for those rights to be vindicated. President McAleese continued:</P>
    <P>How much genius has been lost forever to our world because of this? That loss has not only been a personal tragedy, it has also immeasurably impoverished our society.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to take heed of these words and to support this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I compliment our spokesperson, Deputy Fitzgerald, on her very well researched presentation. I hope the Government will accept this Bill without division. I have no doubt that there is an incredible amount of goodwill in regard to people with a disability, but goodwill without good work will not bring about the improvements that we see as giving equality to people with a disability. That is all we are asking for, nothing more and nothing less. The Constitution, the law of the land and the administrative structures of the State do not offer a guarantee to people with disabilities that they will be treated as full and equal citizens.</P>
      <P>Often they do not have the voice to shout nor the strength to protest. Historically people with disabilities have stood at the back of the queue when resources were being given out. They need and are entitled to basic rights and the means to secure them.</P>
      <P>Recently I had reason to peruse the manual for people with disabilities seeking a disabled driver's grant. I was appalled, saddened and disgusted at the criteria set down when it should be clear to a qualified person such as a doctor or nurse that the person is entitled to what they are seeking. One had to state whether one's right hand was disabled, one's left hand was disabled, one had the use of one's left leg or one had the use of one's right leg. These questions are embarrassing and totally unnecessary. In regard to the improvements in the home, simple things are important and will provide a little comfort in life to those who seek nothing more and should expect nothing less. Again they have to contend with the application form from the local authority and answer questions concerning how many and who lives with them, as if that matters.</P>
      <P>If the person is disabled surely somebody will be living with them. Many will want their independence, with their own home specially adapted. However, they will have to answer a maze of unnecessary questions on financial matters. A person, such as the Minister would be capable of bringing that person to the local authority or going out to interview them and see at face value what these people are seeking. Nothing more and nothing less is required. People are becoming more independent. There are young people in the visitors' gallery with wheelchairs, some motorised, but where can they take them given all the obstacles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are looking to local authorities to provide simple things such as ramps and parking areas to be incorporated in ongoing developments but it is not happening. It is hassle all the way for these people who have to organise themselves. They have to stand outside chapel gates to fund raise That should not be necessary. They should not have to fund raise to bring about the improvements that will give them comforts in life. These people should be admired. They want to play their part in society, they want part-time work. If they have a disability pension and wish to take up <Col N="1063" /> part-time work they will experience difficulties. Should they succeed in getting part-time work their disability pension will be reduced. They cannot win.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister is listening. I plead with her to take the Bill on board and allow it pass through the House without division. If she does that she will have done a great service for the people in most need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is shameful that we are relying on outsiders to introduce a Bill to do this badly needed work, and I am dismayed that the Government is planning to vote it down. The Government has circulated a piece of paper saying it intends to introduce another Bill wider in scope. People have lived on promises made by successive Governments. Let us be honest, we are entering the last months of the Government and it will not get through the House a Bill that will provide the comprehensive response it needs. To say this is based on a philosophy of separation and segregation and opposing mainstreaming is incorrect. This Bill has been drafted by parents who have their children's interests at heart, and for a Minister to say the Government will not accept it for these bogus reasons is ridiculous.</P>
      <P>It is time to shift our approach to citizens. The citizens of this country have rights. For much too long the provision of services such as education depended on the convenience of administrators and providers. That is the shift the Bill is seeking to make. It is a profound shift and one that, as recently as last year when the Education Bill was passed, the Minister for Education and Science refused to accept. That is the record of the Government. The Minister refused the right of appeal in relation to children with special needs. He refused to have a legal right of assessment built into the Education Act. These were opportunities which he refused to accept. Do not ask me to believe that the Minister will come back with a better Bill. We are into the last year of the Government and nothing has come from it in this area. Instead its response has been &ldquo;No, No, No&rdquo; to sensible proposals put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science stands indicted in relation to provision for children with special needs. It has a constitutional right to provide primary care, but that is not being done. Fine Gael conducted a survey of parents of children with special needs. The reality is grim. It found that 65% of parents had to pay privately for the assessment, half of the parents found almost none of the additional supports in assessments was provided, they had to struggle for services for their children and schools were ignorant of the needs of children and were unable to provide the services necessary. Speech therapy is a good microcosm of the problem. The Department of Education and Science must recognise that speech therapy is essential to any education, yet it does not provide one speech therapist. The Minister for Education and Science is responsible <Col N="1064" /> for education, yet he will not provide a single speech therapist. He depends on another Department to come up with speech therapy.</P>
    <P>That is not right's based, that is meeting the turf wars of Departments. It is wrong that the Minister of State should hide behind civil servants who offer her weasel words in amendments, asking us to throw out a well thought out Bill which is workable and which, if necessary, can be amended on Committee Stage if bright ideas come from those Departments. I appeal to the Minister of State not to accept the advice given to her as grounds for rejecting the Bill. This is a sound Bill which is based on the principle of citizens' rights. It proposes an ombudsman so that people can vindicate their rights and those who are powerless will have someone in a position to take the necessary action. Too many parents have to go to court to get their constitutional rights, and that must be changed. The Bill has the support of parents with disabilities right across the board. It is a unique opportunity for the Minister to do something for which she will be remembered. Let this Dáil not end without such a Bill being passed. This is the opportunity to do so. I ask the Minister of State to take it on board and make the necessary changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak on this Bill but I am disappointed the Government will not accept it. I compliment Deputy Fitzgerald for bringing it before the House. People have been lobbying for this Bill for a long time.</P>
      <P>I have spoken on many occasions about people with disabilities. I ask the Government and civil servants why people with disabilities have to fight so hard for everything. Why have they to fight so hard for their rights in regard to housing, education, transport and so on? Why is there such resistance by Governments, councils and health boards to helping people with disabilities? The Bill is reasonable and would give people with disabilities a means by which their complaints would be dealt with. If enacted, it would provide for the appointment of a commissioner. There is no point in talking to health boards or the Ministers for Education and Science or Health and Children because these people are not being listened to. If the commissioner was appointed on a statutory basis he would deal with these Departments and Ministers and inform them that they are not doing what should be done, and those in the</P>
      <P>visitors' gallery would not have to be here tonight or on the streets of every town lobbying and fighting for their rights. Why have they always to fight for their rights? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first time since the foundation of the State that a Government actually has money and an opportunity to deal with many of the problems of these people. The Government is refusing to accept the Bill and that is outrageous. The Minister of State should accept the Bill and if it has faults she can introduce amendments on Committee Stage instead of saying &ldquo;No, No, No&rdquo;, as a famous person, Maggie Thatcher, once said in <Col N="1065" /> regard to everything. People with disabilities have had enough of that. What they want to hear is &ldquo;Yes, Yes, Yes&rdquo;. These people should have a statutory right to education and housing. The Minister should give them a chance and put pressure on the public institutions to provide facilities to help these people, so that they need no longer lobby politicians. A couple of months ago I saw people out in the worst weather lobbying politicians to obtain their rights. That should not happen. We are great at lecturing other countries about what is wrong with them and yet the greatest wrong is evident here, that is, the wrong being done to people with disabilities. We have an opportunity to right that wrong in the Dáil tonight by accepting this Bill. Let us begin to assist and people with disabilities. They have been left behind for too long.</P>
    <P>We are being told now that the Government may need to borrow again this year. We know well that cut-backs will start with the sick, the weak and the people with disabilities. The Minister of State should not let it happen. Tonight she should be brave enough to tell her colleagues that she will accept this Bill and deal with the amendments on Committee Stage. Let us put this commission on a statutory basis, once and for all, and give these people the rights they deserve. They are human beings, they are Irish people and they deserve to be supported. If they were from another country, we would run to enact legislation to deal with them if they were being discriminated against. Enough is enough. It is time they were supported and we set up the statutory commission to deal with their needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and congratulate Deputy Fitzgerald for introducing it. It is a timely and important Bill. The Minister of State should re-examine her decision not to accept it. It is necessary to ensure that people with disabilities have rights enshrined in legislation. They have a right to have their needs assessed and to services to satisfy those needs. That is not an unreasonable request.</P>
      <P>It is a simple measure which proposes to establish the right to assessment of need, and the establishment of a code of rights for people with disabilities. Surely nobody can refuse this basic request. It also proposes to introduce a disability commissioner with appropriate powers and the independence to ensure that those rights are vindicated, that the needs are identified and that the ways of ensuring those needs are satisfied are identified and implemented.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace that people with intellectual disabilities are inappropriately placed in mental hospitals. I will not make an impassioned speech but instead quote the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. Two months ago the inspector stated in his report for last year:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again, the Inspectorate feels compelled to mention the power of accommodating persons with intellectual disabilities in psychiatric <Col N="1066" /> hospitals. The situation has not improved during the past year. In addition to the specialised St. Joseph's Intellectual Disabilities service in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, persons with intellectual disability still remained in some psychiatric hospitals, notably in the South-Eastern Health Board. Such individuals often share wards with mentally ill persons and their clinical and accommodation needs were not adequately met. It is imperative that appropriate accommodation and resources be provided for this group of people. It is disappointing that year after year this matter has to be highlighted.</P>
    <P>We raise this every year following his report. While some improvements have been made, obviously there is no definite commitment to deal with people with intellectual disabilities who are not psychiatrically ill. Such people have a disability; they are not ill and a hospital setting is not the place for people in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I want to deal also with the participation of those with disabilities in the work force The main barrier to the participation of people with disabilities in the work force which must be highlighted again, is the lack of transport in the form of buses and taxis accessible to wheelchair users. There were supposed to be a large number of taxis accessible to people with disabilities but those who received the cheaper licenses for this purpose are instead transporting other people.</P>
    <P>People with disabilities are entitled to bus passes which are worse than useless because there are not enough buses accessible to people with disabilities. While there are some buses accessible to people with disabilities in urban areas, people with disabilities have no chance of getting to use such buses.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of that. It is sad that tonight the Minister has lost an opportunity to show good will towards people with disabilities. This Government has failed to act over the past five years and tonight it has been given an ideal opportunity to do something and accept the good work of the real practitioners in the area of disability. The parents and the families are the practitioners to which any Minister must be compelled to listen and the Minister has failed to listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 300,000 people with disabilities in Ireland. They are seeking their rights and are denied them by this Government. These are <Col N="1067" /> people of all ages and from all walks of life, all of whom experience difficulties in their daily living. It is time this Government ended the pain of these people and their families by accepting this Bill and I congratulate Deputy Frances Fitzgerald on bringing it forward tonight.</P>
    <P>The promises of the Minister for Education and Science in the recent past, and of his predecessor, to bring a disabilities Bill and proposals for training and education before this House, to appoint and recruit 70 additional psychologists to provide needs assessment and to establish a special needs forum in education have all failed to materialise. The Bill seeks to promote and protect the rights of people with disabilities and to secure a fair, speedy and effective resolution of complaints relating to infringement of these rights. It also provides for the appointment of a disability commissioner.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been drafted by the people who know the needs of these people and who know where their franchise has been impinged upon, and the Government still ignores the draft Bill before us. The Bill emerges from the frustration and hollow promises of the Government over the past five years and the National Parents' and</P>
    <P>Siblings' Alliance now calls on the Government to adopt this Bill if it is sincere in its stated concerns.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to honour its promises to address the needs of people with disabilities on many occasions. Worse than this, it has availed of every opportunity to thwart the legitimate efforts of concerned families to gain equal rights for their children.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this Bill. It is a matter of great regret that more than four years into the life of this Dáil we have not seen the publication of the substantive disabilities Bill promised by the Government. We are told it will be published before Christmas and that it will set out rights of persons with a disability together with means of redress for those whose rights are denied. We should have had the opportunity to debate such a Bill long before now. Any statute setting out basic rights requires thorough examination and full debate, including consultation with those directly involved. This is hardly possible now in the time remaining to this Dáil. Therefore, I support this Bill, which has been brought forward in the absence of the promised Government measure. The immediate back<Col N="1068" /> ground is the case of Jamie Sinnott. In October 2000, the High Court ruled that the State was obliged to provide primary education to Jamie Sinnott, an autistic adult. The High Court awarded £225,000 to Jamie and £55,000 to his mother Catherine, plus legal costs.</P>
    <P>The State appealed the judgment to the Supreme Court, which gave its verdict on 12 July 2001. The Supreme Court upheld the State's appeal, ruling that the High Court judgment had breached the principle of separation of powers between the Judiciary and the Oireachtas by telling the Government what education service to provide. The Supreme Court ruled that the right to primary education ended at 18 years. The verdict in the Sinnott case has caused grave concern and alarm to people with disabilities and special needs and to their carers and families. The context was described well by Carol Coulter in <i>The Irish Times</i> who stated that there has been concern in Government and some legal circles for some time at the increasing role of the courts in intervening in what are perceived to be matters of policy. This, however, could have been avoided by the State taking a more pro-active role in ensuring the rights of citizens to special education and other services were met. The most eloquent contribution of all came from the mother of Jamie Sinnott, Catherine Sinnott, who said:</P>
    <P>This case was about more than disability. It was about our relation to the State and we found it was not based on need. It was based on the State's willingness to spend money.</P>
    <P>Shame.</P>

      <P>being of the view that the present Bill</P>
      <P>(f2&gt;a) is based on a philosophy of separation and segregation for people with disabilities; and</P>

      <P>declines to give a second reading to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this debate on disability legislation and the wider issues being raised by the Opposition. It is interesting that the Opposition raised many issues during the debate even though it has not dealt with them in the Bill before the House. It raised issues with which we plan to deal in more comprehensive legislation which will be published before Christmas. This Bill deals with one par<Col N="1069" /> ticular issue. However, there are many other issues which members of the Opposition have raised in the debate tonight, but they do not deal with them in their own Bill. The Government will deal with these issues in its Bill.</P>
    <P>In a range of press releases, speeches and contributions to the House, various Opposition Members stated they see disability as a partisan issue which they hope will help them in next year's election. We are proud of what we have already achieved and the proposals which will be enacted before we complete our mandate. Much has been achieved, but we fully acknowledge much remains to be done. When we go before the people we will have passed more legislation &ndash; it is amazing that some members of the Opposition do not know about the Employment Equality Act, the Equal Status Act, the National Disability Authority or the Comhairle Act &ndash; expanded more programmes and provided dramatically more funding for dedicated services for people with disabilities than any previous Government. This work started in 1997 and will continue through the rest of our term. It is obvious that people with partisan interests will try to claim that we have done nothing. Any objective observer has to admit there has been significant progress.</P>
    <P>We are opposing the Bill before the House on the basic principle that it is too narrow and would represent a return to the old policy of mainstream disability issues being dealt with in a segregated and supplemental manner. In contrast, we will bring forward a fuller Bill which will deal with a wider range of issues, including access and transport, issues mentioned by Deputies, but not included in their Bill, and will require real action by the mainstream agencies whose job must be to provide for all people, including those with a disability.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is one which was produced earlier this year by the National Parents and Siblings Alliance. Like others, I wish to give it credit for its contribution. I received a copy of the Bill in July and have considered its proposals in great depth. The Bill, which is now in the name of Fine Gael, is focused on health care and related services for people with disabilities. It is important that Deputies are aware their Bill focuses on health care and related services, but they are raising other issues with which the Bill does not deal. Health issues are vital for people with disabilities, but the way they are dealt with in the Bill is not the best way to proceed. The Bill seeks to establish a series of new structures, including a disability commissioner, disability advocacy service and a director of proceedings, to implement the provisions in the Bill and investigate complaints. The Bill fails to take account of various developments in the last four years. Many of the arrangements proposed, especially the infrastructural proposals establishing new commissions and authorities, would involve reverting to the old policy of separate and supplementary provision for people with disabilities. <Col N="1070" /> I am sure a disability commissioner, once appointed, would engage with the issues under his or her remit with commitment, professionalism and energy, just as the National Rehabilitation Board did in the past, but that is not the point. We must build on the results of past experience. Past experience tells us that separate provision has tended to result in marginalisation.</P>

      <P>The legislation before us takes its form from the New Zealand Health and Disability Commissioner Act, 1994. There only remains the similarity between the two pieces of legislation. Deputy Bruton referred to the international situation to which I am now referring. The nature and scope of the New Zealand Act and the Bill are quite distinct. The New Zealand legislation establishes a framework for the delivery of health services generally in that country and provides protection in relation to data protection and privacy issues for the citizens of New Zealand. The legislation deals with the entitlements of all consumers of health and related services in New Zealand, including people with disabilities whose access to health services is specifically supported in the Bill. The legislation establishes mainstream institutions to ensure equity of service delivery for everyone in New Zealand, including people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>My goal since taking office has been to seek to place people with disabilities on an even footing with the rest of our citizens. That means avoiding approaches and actions that bear the hallmarks of separation and segregation for the disability sector. I am firmly opposed to some aspects of the Bill before the House on this account.</P>
      <P>The underlying principle of the Government's approach has been that of equality, and its principal objective the achievement of equal participation for people with disabilities. The Government has worked to develop the infrastructure on which this objective can be based. It has put in place a framework of innovative and progressive policy formulation and an unprecedented legis-</P>
      <P>lative programme.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Government has already enacted several major pieces of legislation in this area &ndash; Fine Gael does not seem to have heard of them &ndash; each of which has already had a tangible impact. The Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, ensure that people with disabilities cannot be discriminated against in the workplace and in the provision of goods, facilities and services.</P>

      <P>The Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations have been established as statutory bodies to promote and implement the provisions of these Acts. They operate in a mainstream environment where the organisations which support equal opportunities and redress for other citizens also support equal opportunities and redress for people with disabilities. Why should people with disabilities not be the same as other citizens?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Equality Investigations hears equality cases involving people with disabilities, resulting in the development of an integrated body of case law which encompasses discrimination on grounds of disability.</P>
      <P>I recently heard a number of people attempting to dismiss the significance of these pieces of legislation and the role of the Equality Authority and to suggest they will achieve nothing for people with disabilities. These comments take away from the opportunity to build a constructive and meaningful debate on the Government's forthcoming positive action legislation for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>A crucial feature of this infrastructure of equality and integration is the adoption of the policy of mainstreaming. Mainstreaming was a central recommendation of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. In a public service context mainstreaming means the public bodies which provide services for everyone else are the same bodies which provide services for people with disabilities. The focus of mainstreaming is maximum feasible integration, not segregation. The policy of mainstreaming services for people with disabilities is founded on the principle of equality and involves service providers in varying levels of positive action to support people with disabilities in accessing services. The National Disability Authority Act, 1999, enabled the establishment of the National Disability Authority as a statutory agency specifically tasked with advising the Government on disability policy and monitoring the standard of mainstream service provision for people with disabilities. It has set about its work well in serving people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Comhairle Act, 2000, established Comhairle as a new mainstream agency. In this context <Col N="1072" /> I wish to bring members of Fine Gael up to date. Before we came into government people with disabilities who wanted information had to go to the NRB while other citizens went to Citizens Advice Centres. We brought both together under Comhairle, and people with disabilities now go to the same place as every other citizen, which is surely what we want. We, on this side of the House, do not want segregation, but genuine mainstreaming of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is concerned primarily with health issues, including assessment needs and delivery of related services. It would be great if the Fine Gael Front Bench told its back-</P>
    <P>benchers that this is what is dealt with in the Bill and nothing else.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health and Children has already undertaken a very significant investment programme to enhance the level of support available to people with disabilities and their families. The Government was the first to provide a dedicated capital programme for these services, when my colleague, Deputy Brian Cowen, announced a three year investment programme from 1998, which was greatly extended under the national development plan. Between 1997 and the end of this year £213 million will have been provided to meet identified needs and improve existing services. While talking about millions of pounds may not register with people, it is important that they should know this has created over 1,600 new residential places, around 375 new respite places which will cater for at least 1,200 families and 2,300 new day places.</P>
      <P>The number of persons with an intellectual disability accommodated in psychiatric hospitals was raised by a Member. It is now below 600 from a figure of 970 when the Fine Gael led Government left office. This will continue to reduce as we invest further money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of support services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism will also require greater support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> The Opposition talks a lot about the waiting list for services. It is absolutely right: it is unacceptable to have such a waiting list. However, it also chooses to completely ignore the programme implemented already and the simple fact that we are the first Government to put in place a programme designed to end the waiting list. All around the country in most constituencies of Opposition Deputies new and better services are opening all the time. We are also implementing a specific programme to end the inappropriate placement of people with disabilities in psychiatric facilities and specialist support services for people requiring a more intensive level of support.</P>
    <P>For physical and sensory disability services some £110 million has been allocated, with over 50 long-term residential and 95 respite places, 400 new day care places, an additional 100 physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy posts, home support services and significant changes in the aids and appliances budget.</P>
    <P>In relation to services for people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities, emphasis has also been put on the provision of information, planning and monitoring structures at regional and national level. Once again, more must and will be done, but a constructive debate should start by acknowledging this real progress.</P>
    <P>In terms of mental health services, significant progress has been made in recent years in the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals and the provision of community facilities such as mental health centres and community residences. The child and adolescent psychiatric services have been and continue to be enhanced as have old age psychiatry services. The Mental Health Act, 2001, will provide a modern framework within which people who have mental difficulties and need protection, either in their own interest or in the interest of others, can be cared for. The main vehicle for change will be the Mental Health Commission, to be established under the terms of the Act. Therefore, there are changes on all fronts.</P>
    <P>It hardly needs to be said that a fundamental element in the provision of quality services for people with intellectual disabilities is health professionals delivering those services. A complex multidisciplinary approach has evolved during the years and those health professionals involved have never failed to demonstrate noteworthy drive and professionalism. The Opposition makes much of the shortage of many specialists. It of course refuses to acknowledge the failure of planning which caused this shortage and for which it shares the blame. They key thing is to get things done.</P>
    <P>Following on from the work of a dedicated expert group revised pay scales and enhanced career structures have been put in place for the professions which give positive recognition to the key contribution to the health service made by these groups. The continued implementation of <Col N="1074" /> the report of the expert group is being progressed through a series of working groups representative of all those with an interest in the further development of the professions. This is helping to create conditions which can attract and retain the best people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children has also moved on introducing systematic workforce planning within the health service for the future. He commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. People are encountering practical difficulties. The study, a rigorous and comprehensive quantitative assessment of the demand-supply balance for skilled personnel in the therapy health care sector, was published on 25 July last. It has supplied us with the agenda for ensuring we have the number and quality of professionals required to meet the existing and unmet needs of people with disabil-</P>
    <P>ities as well as the wider population.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science are working closely to ensure the rapid provision of these additional third level places as a matter of urgency. An inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of those Departments and the Higher Education Authority. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study. There is obviously strong interest within the education system in responding quickly to meet identified training needs in these professions. I am very confident that this process will swiftly yield the significant increase in the number of training places required.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is hoped to encourage, in line with the recommendations of the study, flexible and imaginative approaches to increase training provision in order to facilitate the availability of fully qualified graduates at the earliest date possible. These graduates in the different therapies will make a huge difference, especially to children with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In responding swiftly and effectively to the immediate need to fill outstanding vacancies in the health service the study emphasises the role of overseas recruitment, and health boards have travelled abroad to encourage therapists to work in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised the issue of education. My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, has addressed the House on this on a number of occasions. This is one area where the Opposition's position is especially hard to take. In area after area it has been playing catch-up and completely ignored its ongoing refusal to take any meaningful action when it was in a position to show its real commitment. On the day the Government took office there were 100 resource teachers for children with special needs: <Col N="1075" /> today there are over 1,000. There were 300 special needs assistants, today there are 2,000.</P>

      <P>When we came into government we put psychological assessments on the agenda. We ran an inclusive expert review and are expanding the service every year. It is not complete, but it will be and will prove a major accomplishment of the Government. The next step is to bring together the rights of children with special needs into a comprehensive Bill. At <Col N="1076" /> least Deputies recognised that is forthcoming. It will include a practical framework to provide for these rights. This must include relevant structures as well as appropriate appeals mechanisms. This is being done by the Minister and will be called the Education (Children with Disabilities) Bill which will be enacted before the next general election.</P>
      <P>The disabilities Bill proposed by the Government and under preparation in the Department will be broad based in its approach. This is a vital distinction to be drawn with the Bill before the House. Deputies tonight talked about a broad range of issues but do nothing about it in their Bill. The main focus of the Government's Bill will be on positive action measures to support access and participation by people with disabilities. This includes the issue of personal health services.</P>
      <P>Positive action means action to remove barriers where they exist and to provide supports where they are needed. The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, in considering proposals for a disabilities Bill, identified the failure of many public service bodies to make appropriate accommodation for people with disabilities as a serious barrier to people with disabilities and one which should be removed through legislation in the form of a disabilities Bill. This was mentioned by Fine Gael backbenchers tonight but not covered in their Bill.</P>
      <P>It is my intention, and that of my colleague the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to include a range of measures in the disabilities Bill to ensure that all public services are made accessible to people with disabilities. This was called for by Fine Gael backbenchers but not delivered by the Front Bench. I propose basing these measures on a broad interpretation of access and the range of disabilities, which give meaning to the term as well as an innovative approach to public services and what they may include, now and in the future.</P>
      <P>Clearly physical access to buildings and facilities will be an integral part of our approach. I believe that a meaningful disabilities Bill must include this area. The Private Members' Bill before the House tonight does not mention access to buildings. The first barrier to participation is the physical barrier, which prevents a person with mobility impairment from entering or traversing a building or a person with an audio or visual impairment from communicating with the service deliverer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the proposals under consideration in this regard would require information provided to the public to be made available in a range of alternative formats. These formats would include documents in Braille or on disk, a facility already becoming more widely available from public service bodies. The Government disabilities Bill will make the provision of such facility mandatory. The Government Bill will support e-accessibility measures and help minimise barriers to the equal participation of people with disabilities in the <Col N="1077" /> information society. All public service websites will be required by law to be accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us tonight fails to address the area of physical access. Deputies must realise we cannot talk about a positive action disability Bill without dealing with the barrier of physical access. I ask Deputies to consider the range of services and facilities from which people with disabilities often find themselves excluded. These are issues not dealt with in the Fine Gael Bill. They have not mentioned public and national parks, heritage sites, museums or art galleries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>These are all part of the built environment and it is the right of people with disabilities to be able to access those buildings. The Government Bill will also include provisions to support universal design principles and their adaptation by the key personnel who influence our built environment.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us also fails to address the issue of accessible transport. It was mentioned by the Fine Gael backbenchers, but it is not included in the Bill. Public transport is another key area where barriers to people with disabilities need to be removed. It is ironic that, if public transport was accessible to people with disabilities, they would probably have a higher ratio of usage of these services than other groups who can more easily avail of a range of transport options.</P>
      <P>This Government is making great strides towards a more accessible public transport system and is committed under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the national development plan to continuing this progress and I am grateful to my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, for their work in this regard. It is important that the disabilities Bill includes substantive provisions in respect of accessible public transport and I intend to bring forward a range of appropriate measures for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I assume Deputy Bruton can now see that the Government proposes to bring forward legislation that will be substantially wider in scope than what is in this Bill.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of this Government that the operators of all land public transport services, which fall under the remit of the Department of Public Enterprise, and especially State owned enterprises, will move to create an accessible transport infrastructure. Improvements can already be seen.</P>
      <P>There have been many changes since 1997. All DART cars are accessible and new DART cars are to have audio/visual announcements. Dublin Bus now has over 300 low floor accessible buses and will never again purchase inaccessible buses. I could not get that commitment from Deputy Bruton when he was in the relevant Department.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Fitzgerald appreciates the new accessible bus service operating in much of her constituency, but that was totally inaccessible when she left office. By the end of this year, the entire urban bus fleet in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Deputy Noonan's city of Limerick will be fully accessible. This was all completed by this Government.</P>
      <P>Access to necessary health services is a key issue for many people with disabilities and this is addressed in the Private Members' Bill. The Government disabilities Bill will make provision for supports to ensure that the needs of people with disabilities are properly assessed and that the needs identified are appropriately provided for within the health service or on an agency basis. I thank my colleague the Minister for Health and Children for his co-operation in this regard and his assistance in formulating important new provisions which will ensure that people with disabilities receive an appropriate assessment of need and the services resulting from such assessment of need to the maximum possible degree.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Government disabilities Bill in respect of assessment of need and related services, which make up one part of the proposed Government Bill, are reflected to a great extent in the entirety of the Private Members' Bill. What is contained in the Private Members' Bill are one part of a very much more comprehensive Bill that we will bring forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Use of genetic testing is another area not considered in the Fine Gael Bill but it is very <Col N="1079" /> important for some people with disabilities. I propose to consider in the context of the Government Bill the area of genetic testing and the commercial uses to which information obtained from this new area of technology may be put. As an issue that impacts directly on many people with disabilities, the Government Bill, and the proactive approach which will permeate its provisions, is an appropriate locus for these considerations. I am talking about insurance difficulties that people with disabilities have relating to genetic testing.</P>
    <P>A range of other legal issues is under consideration in the context of the Bill and will cut across areas as diverse as landlord and tenant obligations, public procurement procedures and measures to promote the employment of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>E-Government is a real part of our lives now, and will be increasingly so in the future. The</P>
    <P>eEurope Action Plan, adopted by the European Union in 2000, has identified &ldquo;participation for all in the information society&rdquo; as a key objective. The eEurope Action Plan is targeting specific measures which parallel the approach in the disabilities Bill in that they are intended to remove barriers to participation by people with disabilities and to provide support where necessary. I propose these that initiatives be included within the Government disabilities Bill.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the provisions in the Bill that will require public sector websites to be accessible to people with disabilities. Design for all is an important concept in the context of the built environment, information technology or any aspect of our daily lives. I want people with disabilities to be able to access all aspects of daily life equally with everybody else. I do not want them confined to the health services as outlined in the Bill before us tonight. I want people with disabilities to access all areas, buildings and transport systems and our Bill will provide for this.</P>
    <P>Information technology design for all means any electronic based process of creating products, services and systems that are usable by people with the widest possible range of abilities in the widest circumstances. The use of technology makes a huge difference for people with disabilities. It is my aspiration that Ireland will play a leading role in the new world of information technology and that Irish people with disabilities will have the opportunity to participate in the world on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>I stand on my record of delivering good, enforceable law to protect people with disabilities. I will be original in my thinking. The Fine Gael Members have copied the Bill that was published last July and they have confined themselves to one issue with regard to people with disabilities. We will be original in our thinking. Since this time last year, we consulted widely in terms of our disabilities Bill. When the Government Bill is brought forward, even the Members opposite will have to accept it is much more com<Col N="1080" /> prehensive than the one they have brought before the House tonight.</P>

      <P>I would accept anything that will assist people with disabilities, and the Opposition Members know that, but they must realise that some of the proposals contained in the Government's disabilities Bill are vastly more comprehensive and broad in its scope. It is well worth waiting for&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;because we have consulted widely. The Bill will recognise that positive action needs for people with disabilities are not confined to the health services. People with disabilities cannot get into buildings or get on buses and trains. People with disabilities want to access buildings by the front door like the rest of us. These are critical areas and I am determined to change them in our legislation. These areas are not even mentioned in the single issue Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>I want to legislate to improve and develop services for people with disabilities and to ensure the delivery of services to individuals with a disability in an equitable manner.</P>
      <P>The Government would have delivered its disabilities Bill at least two years ago if we did not have to deal with the two equality Bills drafted by the previous Government that were found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. I am making a promise to people with disabilities that we will deliver the Government disabilities Bill which I have outlined tonight, and it will be enacted. We will face the people having enacted five major disabilities Bills, delivered unequalled improvements in services and given unprecedented statutory underpinning to both the mainstream provision of services and expert services required to vindicate the rights of people with disabilities. We will stand on our record and go forward with a much more comprehensive Bill than the Bill before us tonight. We are unable to accept the Bill before us because the Bill to come is much better.</P>

      <P>It is on the list for introduction before Christmas. I raised this matter with the Taoiseach when we came back to the House last week. I asked him if he could give us a definite commitment that the legislation would be introduced before Christmas and he said that he hoped the legislation would be published before Christmas. I await that Bill. If the debate tonight has done nothing else it has fleshed out some of the detail of what the Government is proposing, and for that I thank the Minister of State. I won<Col N="1082" /> der, however, what will be contained in the Bill and why the issues in relation to transport and access to buildings could not have been dealt with in the equal status legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason given at the time &ndash; Deputy Fitzgerald can confirm this &ndash; was that it was because of constitutional restraints. When we proposed an amendment to the Constitution, it was rejected by the Government. I wonder how many more rights in relation to transport, access to buildings and access to employment will be contained in the Government's legislation in view of the fact that the constitutional provisions with regard to private property will not be rebalanced by the Government introducing a section in the Constitution which would guarantee the rights of people with disabilities to access the services and the various other aspects of living which the rest of us enjoy. We need an enabling environment for people with disabilities but I do not see it coming from this Government. I await the Government Bill with bated breath.</P>
      <P>Will the central aspect of the Bill before the House today, namely, the right to an assessment of needs and to the services that flow from that assessment, be contained in the Government's Bill? Deputy Fitzgerald outlined the response from the Department of Finance following the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which rejected that proposal because it would cost too much and might encourage other people to want the same. That is like saying if I get soup, somebody else will want soup also.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a reply I received on this issue from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the political person responsible for this area, on Tuesday, 27 March 2001, in which he stated that the proposal that the needs of individuals with disabilities should be dealt with on a statutory basis has not been accepted, as is made clear in the progress report on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities entitled Towards Equal Citizenship, and that the needs of those with disability are being met in more flexible ways. Will this assessment of need and the rights that flow therefrom be contained in the Government's Bill? The Minister did not spell that out clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>That letter is seven months old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a response from the Minister for Finance and is perhaps an indication that we do not have a Minister for equality at the Cabinet table. I respect the Minister of State but she is not a senior Minister. The Minister for Finance is a senior Minister and if one reads the judgment of Mr. Justice Barr in the Sinnott case <Col N="1083" /> one can see how the Department of Finance can become an obstacle with regard to the implementation of people's constitutional rights. We need a political commitment in relation to this specific issue which is centrally dealt with in the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said this Bill was only about one thing. There is a specific proposal that a charter of rights should be drawn up and under that charter of rights I assume that all these other issues &ndash; I accept there are many other issues that are not specifically dealt with in this legislation &ndash; could have been dealt with under that section by amendment. I agree with the Minister of State that there are broader issues that need to be addressed but this Bill specifically includes the drawing up of a charter of rights for people with disabilities. The Minister of State needs to address that and she particularly needs to address the question of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party proposes to insert a clause into the rights section of the Constitution which would recognise the rights of people with disabilities. To have a really effective disabilities Bill we need to amend the Constitution. It was interesting to hear the Taoiseach reply to questions today about whether he intended to introduce any other amendments to the Constitution. He said &ldquo;No&rdquo;, that he only intended to introduce the abortion referendum. That is an indication of the Government's priority and other priorities, for example, with regard to the Independent Members of this House whose urgent need to be members of their local authorities as well as Members of this House was more important than this issue. That is an indication of the importance of people with disabilities in terms of the priority list of the Government.</P>
      <P>What we are looking for is a rights-based approach which is about citizenship, access, creating an enabling environment for people with disabilities, control of one's own life and acknowledging the diversity of the various people who would be described as having a disability and society in general. Deputy Fitzgerald quoted Professor Gerry Quinn earlier. She stole one of my quotes but I will forgive her for that. I want to quote from an address by Professor Quinn, who runs the department in UCG which deals with the whole question of rights for people with disabilities. He states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The core question here is as old as the first city states of Greece. It implicates a moral vision of the political community &ndash; of who is &ldquo;in&rdquo; and who is &ldquo;out&rdquo;. It concerns our societies' attitude towards human difference &ndash; whether this difference is one of race, creed or ability. It follows that the modern human rights agenda in the context of disability (and more generally) is not so much about power and protecting people against power (although that is very important in institutional settings) &ndash; it is about admitting people to power over their own lives and conferring on them equal rights <Col N="1084" /> to belong and to participate. It is about re-engineering social support to serve the overriding goal of expanding the zone of freedom to include all and not to maintain people &ndash; whether in misery or in luxury &ndash; on the periphery; squatting anxiously forever on the edge.</P>
    <P>That is a profound description of what a rights based approach is about. It is concerned with treating people as individuals and not handing down services to them but involving them in the decisions that are made about their lives. That is included in this legislation in the context of the assessment of needs, where provision is made to consult people on an ongoing basis on their needs and provision for them.</P>
    <P>We also believe that the proposed social services inspectorate should cover situations where people are in institutional care. It is important to ensure that the highest standards prevail and that there is a body with the power to intervene on people's behalf. In this regard the legislation provides for an advocacy system for people with disabilities. In many instances this would amount to self-advocacy where people could argue for their own rights and decide what they need. In other cases the advocacy would be done on behalf of those who are not in a position to argue for themselves.</P>
    <P>We propose the category of people with disability should be broadly based. Over the summer I read a document published by the Forum of People with Disabilities which deals with the cost of disability payment. It is well worth reading. The document points out that there are a number of workable definitions of disability in use, both internationally and in domestic legislation. It also points to the need for dialogue among all organisations. This was addressed when the Bill to which I have referred was launched in Trinity College when other organisations were invited to debate the issues and propose amendments. There is no reason a similar exercise could not be done in this House.</P>
    <P>There is a need to address the issue of personal assistants. It has been addressed by the forum and other bodies. At present many people are dependent on CE schemes for personal assistants. The right to be able to participate fully needs to be dealt with in legislation. That would address part of the problem where approximately 70% of people with disabilities are unemployed. They do not have the same start in accessing employment as the rest of us. If we are to give meaningful rights to people with disabilities we need to ensure they are able to access employment in the same way as others by having their personal needs addressed in legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a poverty trap for people with disabilities in terms of accessing jobs. If they get a job they lose certain entitlements, for example, medical cards, that would help them with the cost of their disability. However, if they do not get a job they must live on £85.50 per week, the current disability allowance. It is a travesty that anybody is expected to live on that in this time of afflu<Col N="1085" /> ence, especially when people with disability must incur extra costs, be it for aids, travel or special foods or clothing.</P>
    <P>I support the proposal contained in the document produced by the Forum of People with Disabilities that a major study be undertaken to assess the various extra costs of disability. Many individuals approach us as public representatives with regard to these issues. A man wrote to me stating:</P>
    <P>I have been asking for a downstairs bedroom. They passed that I need it but I cannot get the 10% cost. Also, I have to get planning permission. But where can any of us get money when we are in wheelchairs? I asked in the county hall if we stayed inside the £16,000 grant but county hall said we would still only get 90%. It is a joke. I have to crawl up my stairs and come down on my backside.</P>
    <P>That is the experience of one individual who does not have an absolute right to a home appropriate to his needs. He has a right to 90% funding but he cannot find the remaining 10% that would bring his home up to the required standard to cater for his needs. This is a right specific to one individual but many people with disabilities have had similar experiences and these need to be addressed in a positive manner by the Government.</P>
    <P>I support what other speakers said about educational needs and the promises made following the Sinnott judgment, which have not been fulfilled with regard to the provision of services and the so-called open chequebook which the Minister for Education and Science indicated he had. In the four and half years the Government has been in office it should have been possible to put the necessary professionals in place to ensure children with special needs in education can access the necessary resources. Last week I was told that teachers who suspect children with dyslexia are attending GPs for assessment because there are not enough educational psychologists and there is insufficient support within the education system to access the assessment needed to enable them to claim the benefits that are apparently to be made available. While a commitment to funding has been made, accessibility is the problem that schools, parents and children face.</P>
    <P>There are many international guidelines, such as the UN standard rules and the conventions referred to by Deputy Fitzgerald both in the UN and the EU. All of these provide good definitions of what should be the rights of people with disabilities. The Labour Party believes that to be able to fully address these rights there is a need for an amendment to the Constitution. That is central to our thinking on this issue, having examined the issues raised by the Sinnott judgment and the judgments on the original Employment Equality Bill and Equal Status Bill introduced by the previous Government. It is necessary to rebalance the Constitution to insert a specific clause that will guarantee the rights of people with dis<Col N="1086" /> abilities to ensure they can fully participate in society.</P>
    <P>I have not been reassured by the Minister of State on the Government's intentions. When will the Government Bill be introduced?</P>

      <P>It is important that the legislation is enacted to ensure that people with disabilities can access their rights. I have serious doubts about the content of the legislation, especially with regard to the basic right proposed in this Bill, which is the right to an assessment of needs and the services that flow from that. This was a central proposal by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities but it appears the Government will not fully support that right. Was I being misled? Maybe the Minister for Finance has changed his mind, but I have not been given any indication that that is the intention of the Government. It is a central proposal on the basis of which can be developed the various aspects of a person's life allowing them to participate fully in society. We need absolute guarantees on it.</P>

        <b>:</b> Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a gabháil leis an Cheann Chomhairle gur thug sé cead dom labhairt faoin ábhar seo, faoi chóras scoile nach bhfuil ar fáil ag na phaistí scoile i gCeatharlach. When I first took up the problems of the school bus service as a young principal in 1962 my difficulties were not with CIE but with an ageing parish priest who would not sign the document to let the bus service start. I finish my career on much the same ground, but this time it is Bus Éireann that is at fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bus service has been wonderful to children and it is a pity when common sense will not prevail. In the case I raise the children were promised collection at the door because a school called Killoughternane, which is easily spelled, was closed. It can be done and mileage can be saved by doing so. The bus leaves Borris, comes to a crossroads and goes left. It travels for 2.4 miles and picks up nobody whereas if it turned right there are six children on the road. Not alone does the bus turn left and travel for 2.4 miles, it goes for another 1.7 miles to turn at a junction, which <Col N="1087" /> is 0.2 miles, giving a total of 1.9 miles, in order to go back down the same road and pick up children on the way back. I know, having had an old maths professor who used to teach geometry with his finger drawing a triantán anseo and an uileann anseo, that it is not easy to sit and listen to this. However, those are the figures and if common sense was ever over-ruled it is in this case.</P>
    <P>There should be a mini-bus on the service but there is a 52 seater instead. The excuse given is that the road to the right is unsafe. That is splitting hairs because the road to the left is just as bad, but I cannot argue with safety. If that is the rule that is given, I accept that. I am hoping that, as a common sense individual, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, will see to it that the children are picked up as promised by putting a mini-bus or something smaller on the route. That would save 2.3 miles each way, or five miles a day. That is over a 1,000 miles in the year. I have often argued, sensibly, for a bus service to be extended a half mile or a mile, but I was always shot down on the basis that I was costing money. The Government would not approve any extra money for buses. In this case I am saving almost 1,000 miles by giving people what they are entitled to. If the Minister of State has been told that it is not safe to have this bus on the route then it should never have been there. No arrangements should ever have been made to have a bus on the route. He cannot ignore my generosity in saving all those miles and in saving the country money. I look forward to hearing him say that common sense has prevailed and that these children will be getting the service they deserve.</P>
    <P>This is a service for children not for a bus or for an innocent bus owner who is caught up in this arrangement. What is happening is much like providing a jumbo jet to Kilkenny Airport. It would be stranded there for life. The big bus is the very same. It cannot go around the turn and it is time common sense prevailed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter because it gives me the chance to outline the position. I should explain that one of the main objectives of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from school and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending school regularly. As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that as far a possible no eligible pupil will have to travel more than 1.5 miles to the pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way or be brought to a convenient pick-up point along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as part of the scheme as the cost of providing such a service countrywide would be prohibitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application was made by four families from the Killoughternane &ndash; I hope I am pronouncing <Col N="1088" /> that correctly &ndash; Dunroe and Knocksquire areas for the school bus to be rerouted to the road on which their homes are located. A report was requested from Bus Éireann. The report indicated that the pupils in question reside between 0.2 and one mile from the current pick-up point. It was also stated that it is not possible to extend the service as requested as the proposed route is unsuitable for the large contractor's vehicle which currently operates the service. The alternative would be the provision of a smaller vehicle on the route to accommodate the pupils. This option is being examined at present and I have asked for a decision to be made as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have looked at this problem personally since Deputy Brown brought it to my attention this morning and the provision of a smaller vehicle seems to be an eminently sensible one. If there is no unforeseen and insurmountable difficulty I assure him that one will be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Health and Children and his officials for the reply to a parliamentary question of last Wednesday and the reports enclosed therein. However, a number of question marks still hang over the debate. The major one is that on 24 September 1973 Dr. Dunleavy of the Eastern Health Board wrote to Wellcome enclosing a list of lot numbers of Trivax which had caused severe adverse reactions. Included in this report were two lot numbers which corresponded to Tribovax T. It must be noted that this report was compiled at the request of Wellcome so they could investigate the reasons for these severe reactions. Surely the first step performed on receipt of these lot numbers was to check the analytical log books to find the corresponding batch number. At that stage it should have been clearly evident that these two lot numbers corresponded to a Tribovax T and not a Trivax vaccine batch. If this was a transcription error why was the Eastern Health Board not contacted and asked to clarify the error? Why has GlaxoSmithKline not furnished any information in relation to this investigation of these lot numbers in its eight page report? Not a word is mentioned in that report and one must ask why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the manufacturing procedures employed in the production of both vaccines it is the case that both vaccines were stored in the same cold store after their arrival in Dartford. Both vaccines were transferred to the filling room at approximately the same time due to the sequential lot numbers allocated to the batch of Trivax and Tribovax T. It is claimed in the <Col N="1089" /> GlaxoSmithKline report that the quality control procedures used to check the final product would have made it impossible to mistake the two vaccines. However, in 1991 Wellcome in the Best High Court case openly admitted its quality control procedures at that time were virtually non-existent. How can the company stand over its procedures in 2001 when it was not prepared to do so in a court of law ten years earlier?</P>
    <P>It is a fact that three separate medical practitioners in three separate clinics at Rathfarnam, Crumlin and Temple Street Children's Hospital recorded that Tribovax T was administered to children. It is a fact that these children reacted severely to the vaccine and it is a fact that Wellcome received reports of these reactions on 24 September 1973 for the purpose of carrying out an investigation into those reactions. The statistical probability of three separate and eminent medical practitioners in three separate clinics recording in error a Tribovax T batch number instead of a Trivax number, while the Wellcome investigative team failed to pick up on that transcription error, is the same as that of winning the lotto twice in one week.</P>
    <P>GlaxoSmithKline had a vested interest in ensuring that this was a transcription error yet the Minister has not provided a shred of evidence to support this claim. I ask him to reply to the following questions in his response. Does he agree that the formal record clearly states that these children were administered with an animal vaccine? Has he any evidence or record that states definitively that this vaccine was not an animal vaccine? Has he in his possession the results and conclusions of the Wellcome investigation into these severe reactions, which would have highlighted the transcription error, if that was the case? Have GlaxoSmithKline, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Department of Health and Children a copy of the correspondence that would have been sent by Wellcome to the Eastern Health Board pointing out that these batches were Tribovax T, not Trivax, and that this must have been a mistake?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister honestly believe that there was a transcription error and that, if it had been a transcription error, Wellcome would not have raised the matter with the Eastern Health Board in 1973? I suggest to him that, on the basis of all the currently available information, the conclusions drawn by GlaxoSmithKline, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Irish Medicines Board are supposition and conjecture. The Minister has not yet provided one scintilla of evidence to support the claim of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and apologise for the mishap last week. I was outside and got here one minute too late. Hence, I was not in the Chamber and my script was outside the door. It has taught me to be present and not to be distracted in the corridor on the way to the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> I am pleased to have this opportunity to clarify the issue. The background to it is the publication of reports in the <i>Irish Independent </i>on 28 and 29 June last which suggested that the veterinary vaccine Tribovax T was administered in error to Irish children in the early 1970s. Following publication of these reports I instructed my Department to take immediate action and investigations were initiated by the company concerned &ndash; now GlaxoSmithKline &ndash; the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    <P>A preliminary report was received from GlaxoSmithKline on 3 July last and a copy of this report was given to Deputy Naughten. The company's final report was received on 27 September and I have given a copy to Deputies Naughten, McManus and Gormley. The report is available to any Member of the House should they request it. I am also making it available to the media. I will briefly outline its conclusions for the House.</P>
    <P>The company's report has put the case that transcription errors in the lot numbers recorded in hand-written vaccination records are a much more probable explanation than the allegation put forward in the<i> Irish Independent</i> that a child had received Tribovax T instead of Trivax. The company argues that lot numbers of Tribovax T and Trivax are very similar, whereby the transposition of only one digit would be sufficient to result in the lot number of the human vaccine Trivax being incorrectly recorded, as if it were the veterinary vaccine Tribovax T manufactured by the same company.</P>
    <P>The company's report also sets out in considerable detail the manufacturing process for both Trivax and Tribovax T which, according to the report, were manufactured in separate buildings, then put in cold storage in separate buildings and released from storage into different sized bottles. The company states that the human vaccine Trivax was contained in ten litre, green labelled bottles and subsequently filled into 0.5 millilitre ampoules or five millilitre bottles, whereas Tribovax T was contained in 15 litre red labelled bottles and subsequently filled into 20 millilitre and 100 millilitre bottles.</P>
    <P>A Trivax vaccine would have been clearly distinguishable from Tribovax T when received by the health board clinic. In appearance, Trivax was a white precipitate in water white solution, whereas Tribovax T was a heavy precipitate in light brown solution. Furthermore, Trivax was in 0.5 millilitre ampoules and 5 millilitre round clear glass bottles whereas Tribovax T was in 20 millilitre and 100 millilitre square, clear glass bottles according to the report. The outer packaging of the vaccines was also clearly distinguishable. Trivax cartons were labelled &ldquo;Trivax &ndash; Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis Vaccine. Dose 0.5 ml&rdquo; and the Tribovax T vaccine was labelled &ldquo;Combined cattle vaccine. Dose 2 ml. For protection against blackleg and black disease.&rdquo; The company's report has concluded that:</P>
    <P>. . . given the manufacturing controls and quality checks described above coupled with <Col N="1091" /> the physical inspection necessary to complete the mandatory routine testing of filled bottles of Trivax vaccine, it is virtually impossible for Tribovax T to have been passed as Trivax, given the marked physical difference in appearance of the vaccines.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the alleged administration of the animal vaccine took place almost 30 years ago and the difficulties this has caused in terms of investigating the issue, the Irish Medicines Board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority consider that, on the basis of all currently available information, the most likely explanation is that the health professionals involved at the time may have made simple hand-written errors in transcribing the lot number from the vaccine to the individual vaccine record cards.</P>
    <P>The company, in its report, had indicated that should any further information of relevance come to hand, it would inform my Department immediately. Subsequently, on 4 October, GlaxoSmith-</P>
    <P>Kline wrote to my Department to state that it had also checked the lot numbers in all listings of reported adverse events to Trivax received from the Eastern Health Board to see whether all related to this product. Some additional information has come to light as a result of this exercise.</P>
    <P>The company has advised that three further discrepancies have been found, in which the batch numbers cited refer to products other than Trivax. Two of these corresponded to distilled water vials and the other to blackleg vaccine products manufactured by the same company. As in the other cases, the transposition of one digit in each instance would give a Trivax batch number corresponding to ones in use in the Eastern Health Board area during the 1970s. The company has stated that it appears that these cases also arise from simple transcription errors. As this information has only come to light in the past few days, I am now seeking further clarification and will keep the Deputy informed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am most anxious that public concern arising from these allegations should be allayed. Parents should continue to have confidence in the ongoing vaccination programmes and the benefits to children's health of such programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that restrictions in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, may be discriminatory and contrary to EU employment law. In order to study medicine in the United Kingdom or the North of Ireland, after completing a degree, a graduate cannot obtain a place as an intern in an Irish hospital because of the provisions under section 37(2) of the Act. We are discriminating against Irish nationals who want to work at home. In the past we did not have sufficient places for <Col N="1092" /> them to attend medical school in Ireland and they were forced to accept places in Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Ironically, non-nationals who pursue medicine in UCD, UCC, NUIG, TCD or the Royal College of Surgeons can obtain such places in Irish hospitals. UCD has a conferring arrangement for medical students in universities in Malaysia. It is possible for a Malaysian student conferred by UCD to come to Ireland to practise as an intern in Irish hospitals, even though an Irish person is debarred because he or she has trained in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Funnily, UK students who study medicine in Ireland can act as interns in Irish hospitals. Therefore, the Minister will understand the frustration, anger and sheer bewilderment of Irish parents with the provision in an Act which they believe favours non-nationals and discriminates against their son or daughter.</P>
      <P>One case has come to my notice. It pertains to a young girl who graduated in June 2000 with an honours degree in medicine. She already held an honours degree in physiology and is a graduate of UCC. She is a Cork native and married to a Corkman. She has been travelling to and from the United Kingdom at weekends to ensure her marriage survives. She applied for an internship in Ireland, but was refused on the basis of the appendix under the provisions of the Act. In June, if she applies for an internship in the United Kingdom, it means she will be away from her husband for another year.</P>
      <P>In June 2002 she will be unemployed, although, statistically, she has two honours degrees. The present section of the Bill is inequitable. It is out of date, nor is it in line with the tenets of any Anglo-Irish agreement put in place. Surely, it must be contrary to EU law pertaining to the freedom of movement of workers. Fortunately, it is possible through ministerial regulation for the Minister to change the appendix by declaring that medical students who qualified at recognised medical colleges in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom can and should be competent to act as interns in Irish hospitals. This is possible by regulation and by holding discussions with the Medical Council. It is not necessary to change the Medical Practitioners Act to allow fair play to an Irish person who is extremely competent and well trained and wants to come home and work here in a system which needs such outstanding graduates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Batt O'Keeffe for raising this issue because it gives me the opportunity to go through the various points he made.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a very strict regulatory regime which ensures only competent and properly qualified medical practitioners can work in this country. No doctor is allowed to practise medicine in Ireland unless he or she is registered on the Register of Medical Practitioners. The overriding rationale behind these requirements is to ensure the protection of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> Under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, the Irish Medical Council is the independent body charged with regulating medical registration. Under the Act a person who wishes to become a registered medical practitioner must first obtain a certificate of experience from the body that granted him or her his or her primary degree. To obtain a certificate of experience the applicant must have been employed in a training hospital as a medical resident or intern for a period specified by the Medical Council. The training hospital must also be approved as such by the council.</P>
    <P>The situation the Deputy referred to arises when a person wishes to carry out his or her internship training in Ireland having obtained his or her primary qualification abroad. Section 37 and the Fourth Schedule of the Medical Practitioners Act requires that the primary qualification required to qualify for internship must be obtained from an Irish university. Where a person does not hold such a primary qualification, he or she cannot be granted the provisional registration which allows him or her carry out his or her internship in Ireland. I have made inquiries of the Irish Medical Council in regard to the issue raised by the Deputy and it has confirmed that the situation is as I have outlined.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, we are conducting a review of the Medical Practitioners Act. In the 23 years since the Act was enacted many changes have taken place in the practice of medicine. The expectations of the public as regards the nature and quality of its medical care have grown, issues such as competence assurance, clinical audit, reaccreditation and evidence based medicine have come to the fore, the need for more accountability from public services and bodies has been acknowledged and the need for public confidence in the ability of the medical profession to regulate itself and the requirement to deliver a quality assured, patient centred service have become issues.</P>
    <P>The review of the Medical Practitioners Act is being carried out in light of these developments. Consultation has been widespread with many interested groups, including the Irish Medical Council, the training bodies and bodies representing the medical professions and patients. I assure the Deputy that I am aware of the issue he has raised and it will be addressed as part of this review. In light of his representations this evening, I will see if we can do something in the interim by way of regulation. We hope that draft heads of a new Medical Practitioners Bill will be published before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have been given the opportunity of raising the need to revoke the citizenship granted to Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfooz, an associate and supporter of Osama bin Laden. If Ireland is to have any credibility in the fight against international terrorism, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must <Col N="1094" /> immediately revoke the Irish citizenship granted in dubious circumstances by his Fianna Fáil predecessor in 1990 to Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfooz and his family.</P>
      <P>It now transpires that Sheikh Mahfooz is a brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden. Shortly after citizenship was granted and passports given to him by the then Fianna Fáil Taoiseach at a special luncheon in the Shelbourne Hotel, it became clear that Sheikh Mahfooz was wanted in America and elsewhere as a major international crook and swindler. The chickens have really come home to roost in that evidence has been produced that Sheikh Mahfooz has been a major financial backer of the international terrorist network headed by his brother-in-law, Osama bin Laden. The evidence is that Mahfooz and the financial institutions which he either owned or with which he was associated channelled millions of dollars by way of payments directly to Osama bin Laden or to bin Laden's front organisations Islamic Relief and Blessed Relief. One of his family served on the board of one of these front organisations.</P>
      <P>Citizenship was granted and passports issued to Mahfooz and his family in the most dubious circumstances. We do not yet have the report of the Moriarty tribunal which fortunately is inquiring into what may have been outrageously corrupt practices in the issue of some of these and other passports for sale between 1989 and 1994. What is clear at this stage is that, in about three days between 6 and 9 December 1990, the applications were completed, naturalisation finalised and passports issued, despite the fact the applicants did not comply with the requirements regarding residency or production of evidence of good character which were the basis on which the scheme was supposed to be run at the time.</P>
      <P>I demand on behalf of Fine Gael that citizenship in these cases be revoked immediately. The Minister has power under section 21 of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act to revoke the certificates of naturalisation. It is bad enough that the name of Ireland should have been besmirched by granting citizenship to international crooks. It is totally unacceptable that we should issue passports and give citizenship to those who are associated with and financially support Osama bin Laden.</P>
      <P>Members of the Government, some of whom were also involved in Government when these applications for citizenship were granted, must be aware that the circumstances surrounding the applications were fraudulent. That in itself is a ground for revocation. The Minister is also entitled to revoke when the person to whom citizenship has been granted has by any overt act failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State. Surely the support given to international terrorism by Sheikh Mahfooz provides grounds for revocation under this heading. In any event, the fact that the applicants never resided in Ireland is in itself a ground for revocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> There is a political imperative to take action now in this matter. How citizenship was granted and passports issued by the Fianna Fáil Government at the time has yet to be fully explained. Whatever the circumstances, this country cannot be associated with those who have supported international terrorism, especially those supporting Osama bin Laden. The citizenship in these cases should be revoked now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who cannot be here tonight and for the benefit of the House in general, I am pleased to respond to the matters raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The shock of the horrendous attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001 reverberated throughout the world. It created a firm determination on the part of governments to redouble their efforts to co-operate in combating terrorism. Ireland will not be found wanting in this regard. On behalf of the Minister, I assure Deputies that the Garda Síochána is co-operating fully with current worldwide investigations into these atrocities, but I am sure they will appreciate that it would not be prudent to comment on specific aspects of them at this time.</P>
      <P>While the Deputy's concern about these matters is understandable, the basis of his support for the revocation of the citizenship of Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfooz and his family would appear to be based on speculative reports in the media which are based simply on a family connection. While it would not be appropriate for the Minister to comment on these reports about named individuals, he has asked me to give some background information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfooz and a number of family members were approved for naturalisation by a previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986. Given the ministerial discretion embodied in that Act regarding the granting of certificates of naturalisation, it is not for the Minister to determine the basis on which that discretion was exercised. The names and addresses of the individuals concerned appeared in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on 1 and 8 September <Col N="1096" /> 1992. It has been long standing practice in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that details of individual applications for naturalisation, apart from those which are published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, are treated as confidential and it is not intended to depart from that practice on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the issue of revocation. Section 19 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 empowers the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to revoke a certificate of naturalisation in a number of specified circumstances some of which were referred to by Deputy O'Keeffe. There are four different situations: the issue of the certificate was procured by fraud, misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent, or concealment of material facts or circumstances; the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State; the person to whom it is granted is also, under the law of a country at war with the State, a citizen of that country; the person to whom it is granted has by any voluntary act other than marriage acquired another citizenship.</P>
    <P>Before revoking a certificate of naturalisation the Minister must give notice of his intention to the person to whom the certificate was granted, stating the grounds therefor and the right of that person to apply to the Minister for an inquiry as to the reasons for the revocation. If the person in question so requests the Minister is obliged to refer the case to a committee of inquiry appointed by him consisting of a chairman having judicial experience and such other person the Minister may think fit. Thereafter the committee must report its findings to the Minister with a view to informing his decision.</P>
    <P>I hope it is clear therefore that the revocation of a certificate of naturalisation is a serious matter and one in which the Minister must be in a position to show that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. However, the Minister has asked me to assure Deputy O'Keeffe that if the circumstances of any particular case warrant revocation under these provisions, he will have no hesitation in doing so. I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for raising this matter.</P>

      <P>In recognition of the difficulties which students have been experiencing and following consultation with third level colleges, this Government introduced a special tax incentive to encourage the provision of student rented residential accommodation in section 50 of the 1999 Finance Act. The most up to date results of a survey undertaken earlier this year indicate that already there are 2,260 additional places provided as a result of the tax incentive scheme. A further 14,523 bed spaces are under way and due for completion under this scheme. The tax relief gives 100% deduction of construction, conversion or refurbishment expenditure, which can be offset against all rental income whether derived from the premises in question or other lettings and is available for expenditure up to 31 March 2003.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, this Government will evaluate the impact of the tax incentives and will consider further action in the light of the results of the evaluation. As part of this evaluation, a survey was undertaken earlier this year and is currently being updated to establish the existing and future supply of student accommodation.</P>
      <P>In addition to the section 50 tax incentive scheme, this Government introduced &ldquo;rent a room&rdquo; relief in last year's budget. It allows home owners rent out a room in their homes and have rental income of £6,000 a year tax free. The initiative has boosted the market for lodgings and encouraged householders, who would not have considered it in the past, to think about taking in students.</P>

I intend to put in place supports to encourage completion of the leaving certificate and to enable advancement to localised higher education opportunities. Following further consideration of the matter, it has recently been decided to proceed with plans to develop centres in Wexford and Kilkenny. Proposals for similar initiatives in other areas, including Skibbereen, will be reviewed in the light of the experience gained from the development of the centres in Wexford and Kilkenny and in the context of the resources which are available to me.</P>

      <P>There are 365 mainstream primary schools and 12 special schools in County Cork. The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, which is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment on 30 September 2001 will determine the staffing for the school year 2002-03. The data in relation to the number of pupils enrolled on 30 September 2001 will be forwarded to my Department by the boards of management of the individual schools in the near future. On receipt of all the data from the individual boards, my Department will determine the staffing position of all schools by reference to the current staffing schedule.</P>
      <P>The number of posts arising from the demographic dividend will also be determined. Discussions will then commence with the education partners with regard to the staffing schedule for the 2002-03 school year. On completion of the staffing discussions, my Department will issue a new staffing schedule for the 2002-03 school year. Schools will then be able to determine their mainstream staffing for the coming school year.</P>

      <P>The Irish experience in relation to the examination performance of young men and women in the leaving certificate examination mirrors international experience. The difference in the examination results between young men and women is not unique to Ireland.</P>
      <P>My Department and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, have commissioned educational research by research agencies on this matter. This research has included an analysis of the possible factors contributing to the performance of young men and women in this examination. Do Schools Differ, was a research project undertaken by the Education and Social Research Institute for my Department which explored the impact of schooling factors on a range of pupil outcomes at junior and leaving certificate levels. This research confirms the different levels of examination performance by gender and also indicates that females make greater progress relative to their initial ability. Girls apply themselves better to homework and study and have higher educational aspirations.</P>
      <P>The longitudinal study of the 1994 junior certificate candidates who took the leaving certificate examination in 1996 or 1997, carried out by the Education Research Centre for the NCCA, demonstrated that boys are underrepresented in the group achieving top marks. At the request of the equality committee in my Department, the equality studies department in UCD has been engaged since 1998 in a detailed two phase quantitative analysis of performance of boys and girls in the junior certificate examination in all subjects but with particular attention to mathematics. The report of this research is being prepared for publication by the end of 2001 and its findings will be considered by me in formulating policy in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While some of the above research had a focus on attainment at junior certificate level, nevertheless differences in levels of attainment by gender are maintained right up to leaving certificate level as was shown for the results in 2001. Arising from the ongoing concern raised in relation to the growing disparity in the attainment of boys and girls across all subjects at leaving certificate level, I have asked the equality committee of my Department to commission a detailed analysis of past examination results from the time my Department began to issue disaggregated results by gender in the late 1980s. This will be followed by a research project which will involve a detailed examination of all possible causes of the differ<Col N="1100" /> ences in the examination results of young men and women.</P>

      <P>My Department has been engaged with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, in an ongoing reform of the leaving certificate examination since the early 1990s. Syllabi for the modern languages, Gaeilge, accounting, business and music have been revised. The implementation of the revised syllabi has, in each case, been supported by extensive in-service provision for teachers. The revised syllabus for leaving certificate English was examined for the first time on 6 June 2001. Revised syllabi for the physical sciences, home economics and biology will be implemented over the next few years. A significant feature of this reform of the leaving certificate is the vocationalisation of curricula, that is, an increased emphasis on those aspects of a subject that will be applicable in the work place.</P>
      <P>As well as revisions to the established leaving certificate, new and innovative leaving certificate options are now provided for students. The leaving certificate vocational programme caters for students who want a leaving certificate qualification that prepares them consciously for the needs of the workplace. The leaving certificate applied is provided for students for whom the established leaving certificate is inappropriate. Revised leaving certificate applied syllabi were implemented in the current school year.</P>
      <P>The NCCA has currently in place a senior cycle review committee, on which my Department, teacher unions, school management organisations, third level education and the world of work are represented. When its deliberations are completed, comprehensive advice regarding the future shape of senior cycle, including leaving certificate, options and assessment will be presented to me. The advice given to me by the NCCA will then be examined within my Department and discussed with the partners in education before any action is taken. Meanwhile, schools are encouraged to offer as many of the programmes as possible and to take a more holistic view of senior cycle within the school. This approach is supported by the work with schools undertaken by the second level support service funded by my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>The Jamie Sinnott case related to the educational entitlements of a young man over 18 years of age who has suffered from autism and profound mental and physical disability since infancy. There are currently ten cases before the High Court which relate to the educational entitlements of persons with special needs who are over 18 years. The persons in question suffer from a variety of special needs, including autism.</P>
      <P>As I have previously indicated to this House, I regard it as entirely unacceptable that any parent and, in particular, a parent of a child with special needs, should find it necessary to resort to litigation to secure their child's educational entitlements. While this Government has presided over an unprecedented level of development in special education services, I am fully aware that much work remains to be done.</P>
      <P>In August of this year I announced a range of new measures aimed at further enhancing the scope and quality of our special education services. These measures include the holding of a special needs education forum, the introduction of a Disabilities (Education and Training) Bill, the accelerated development of the national educational psychological service, the accelerated development of the National Council for Special Education and the establishment of a group of senior officials in my Department to examine education services for students with special needs at second level.</P>
      <P>These measures, coupled with the action already taken by this Government in the special needs area, will ensure the delivery of a quality education service for all who need it and remove the need for parents to have recourse to litigation to have their children's educational entitlements addressed.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year I extended the early education provision for children with autism to three year olds, and extended their school year to include July. In August this year I announced a further range of important new measures in the special education area. These included the holding of a special needs education forum, the introduction of a Disabilities (Education and Training) Bill, the accelerated development of the national educational psychological service, the accelerated development of the National Council for Special Education and the establishment of a group of senior officials in my Department to examine <Col N="1102" /> special education services for students with special needs at second level.</P>
      <P>Arrangements to hold the special needs education forum are proceeding in my Department. My objective is that the forum should take place in early November 2001. The discussion at the forum will be considered in the context of the debate on the Disabilities (Education and Training) Bill which I hope to publish as soon as possible. This Bill is being treated as a priority by the Government. The objective of the Bill will be to clarify and copperfasten the entitlements of people with disabilities to appropriate support services and to facilitate the delivery of those services in an effective manner.</P>
      <P>The original development plan for the national educational psychological service envisaged the service achieving nationwide coverage by the end of 2004. The Government has now approved proposals for the accelerated development of the service with the objective of achieving nationwide coverage by the end of next year. Arrangements to recruit additional psychologists to the service are proceeding.</P>
      <P>The Government has also approved the accelerated establishment of the National Council for Special Education. The intention is that the council, which will be responsible for the provision of research, expert advice and certain operational functions in the delivery of special education services, will be set up this year and will be operating on a full statutory basis as soon as feasible thereafter.</P>
      <P>A group of senior officials in my Department has already commenced work on reviewing our current approaches to addressing the educational needs of students with disabilities at second level. I expect this group to report soon and it is my intention to seek Government approval for any measures considered necessary to improve services for the students in question.</P>
      <P>The measures to which I have referred, coupled with the substantial development in special education services which have already been undertaken by this Government, will ensure that all children with special needs receive the best possible quality of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The funding arrangements for our post-primary schools have evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and reflect the sectoral division of our second level system. I have already made it clear in the House that I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post-primary schools and is a <Col N="1103" /> valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach.</P>
      <P>The recommendations made in the steering group's report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, and I am committed to bring greater equity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools.</P>
      <P>I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. The introduction of this support fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. In addition, schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and by £10 from September this year, bringing the standard <i>per capita</i> grant over £200 for the first time. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
      <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity raised by the voluntary secondary schools.</P>

      <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Bill is part of the Government's overall strategy of <Col N="1104" /> addressing in a meaningful way widespread public concern about abuse of children while they were in institutional care, in particular, in orphanages, industrial schools and reformatory schools. The institutions concerned were those over which the State had significant supervisory or regulatory responsibilities, mainly arising under statute. While in a legal sense the Government cannot accept liability for acts of abuse in the institutions, there nevertheless remains the fact that some children did suffer abuse while in State care. Apart from these considerations there is also the fact that the children concerned were separated from their parents and, therefore, did not enjoy the care and protection which children in the care of their parents normally enjoy. They relied to a significant extent on public bodies to protect them and it is now all too clear that notwithstanding that duty some children were abused.</P>
      <P>The payment of public moneys as financial redress for abuse suffered in such cases is, therefore, appropriate. These considerations do not apply to day schools where public bodies did not have the kind of supervisory functions, powers or duties which applied in the residential institutions and the children themselves were resident with their families.</P>
      <P>People, who as children suffered sexual abuse in schools, have other remedies. Amendments to the Statutes of Limitation recognise that a person who suffered sexual abuse in childhood may not have been in a position, due to the abuse suffered, to take legal action against the abuser. Normally, a person would only have three years from the date on which he or she attained his or her majority to bring such an action. The statute now provides that the normal period of three years within which a person can bring an action will not apply where the delay in bringing the action resulted from the abuse itself, for example, suppressed memories of abuse.</P>
      <P>Following an amendment to the Statutes of Limitation made by this Government, provision was made for a person who suffered sexual abuse and who was advised that their claims were statute barred. To assist such people in bringing a claim, provision was made for a special one year period, from June 2000 to June of this year, to allow such a person to commence actions against his or her abusers. As regards other kinds of abuse and the application of the statute, the Law Reform Commission has published a discussion document on the broader issue of limitation periods in those cases and is considering the issues further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the functions laid down in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000, requires the commission to advise the Government on the actions that may be taken to alleviate the damage suffered by persons who were abused in childhood. The commission process is open to all people who suffered abuse in childhood, except where the abuse occurred in a family home. The commission may have views on how <Col N="1105" /> issues of compensation for abuse in ordinary schools can be dealt with.</P>

Since then the number of special needs assistants allocated by my Department to cater for special needs children in primary schools has increased from less than 300 to approximately 2,500. Further special needs assistant posts will continue to be allocated in response to professionally assessed needs.</P>
      <P>In many cases the required support can take the form of a special needs assistant who supports the class teacher in meeting the needs of the child or children involved.

      <P>The appeal results for the 2001 leaving certificate examination were issued by my Department on 4 October. In the processing of appeals the work of each candidate was fully re-marked question by question.

The details on a subject by subject basis are:</P>

      <P>There are two principal routes to qualification as a science teacher. The first route is the concurrent model, which comprises the B.Sc. in Science Education at Dublin City University and the B.Sc. (Education) in Biological Sciences and B.Sc. in Physical Sciences at the University of Limerick. In 2002, the University of Limerick also launched a B.Sc. in Physical Education with a chemistry elective.</P>
      <P>The main route for qualification is via the consecutive model, whereby students gain a relevant primary degree followed by a Higher Diploma in Education, HDip. The HDip is a one year postgraduate qualification programme which is offered by five universities: Trinity College Dublin and the four constituent universities of the National University of Ireland at Cork, Dublin, Galway and Maynooth.</P>
      <P>My Department is continuing to monitor overall supply and demand in relation to second level teachers, and also any shortages which may arise in particular subject areas. In October 2000 I established the task force on the physical sciences which is examining issues in relation to the declining uptake of the physical sciences at second and third level. The task force submitted its interim report to me in July 2001 and I expect the task force to submit its final report to me in early 2002. I understand the task force is addressing a range of issues in relation to the teaching of science at second level.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding <Col N="1109" /> towards ancillary services in schools in the form of assistance to schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. This assistance is provided under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools and caretakers in primary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme. The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>
      <P>In addition to the funding arrangements outlined, I have provided funds so that schools at second level now also receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund. While provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund schools themselves are given discretion as to how precisely the funding is applied.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes, CE, come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to make significant progress in the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for the re-distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post-primary levels are now almost finalised and I expect to be in a position to launch them within the next week. My Department is arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and post-primary schools. These circulars, which will be available shortly, will outline details of the new funding arrangements. I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more <Col N="1110" /> gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
    <P>Schools that used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from special education section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>The achievements of students in higher level mathematics this year were better than normal, at foundation level they were about the same as in recent years, while at ordinary level they were below normal. The award of low grades in engineering has not increased. In fact the percentage obtaining a low grade in higher level engineering is lower than that for the last two years while the percentage obtaining a lower grade in ordinary level engineering is on a par with the figures for the last two years. The overall results for engineering as well as for mathematics at higher level and foundation level are satisfactory.</P>
      <P>I have already expressed my concern at the incidence of low grades in leaving certificate ordinary level mathematics this year and have asked the Inspectorate to prepare a report on the matter. On the basis of the report I will then take appropriate action. I draw the Deputy's attention to the chief examiner's report for leaving certificate mathematics for 2000 as well as reports on junior certificate mathematics for 1998 and 1999 which are available on my Department's website or directly from my Department. A number of strengths and weaknesses are identified in these reports together with detailed recommendations for teachers and candidates. In addition, the current in-career development programme for teachers of mathematics at junior cycle should have the effect of improving the teaching and learning of mathematics at all levels, as teacher skills are enhanced and the range of classroom teaching strategies is broadened.</P>

      <P>In June of this year the Government approved major structural reform of my Department. One of the major elements of this reform was the establishment of an examinations commission. The commission will be a body independent of the Department. It will be established under the terms of the Education Act, 1998, and will be headed by a board of commissioners. The commission will have overall responsibility for the certificate examinations within the general policy framework set by the Minister. Its work will include administering examinations, ensuring best practice and advising the Minister as required. It is envisaged that the commission will be headed by a chief executive and will have dedicated administrative and professional staffing.</P>
      <P>The creation of an examinations commission with operational responsibility for the running of the examinations will bring us into line with international practice. Critically it will also allow the Department to focus to a greater extent on policy and evaluation as the commission takes over the day-to-day running of examinations. The planning process, including an intensive consultation process with staff, is already well advanced in my Department with a view to having the initial recruitment of top level staff commence in the early new year.</P>

      <P>On my appointment as Minister for Education and Science I expressed my concern in regard to the number of school children with low literacy levels. I am aware from the national English reading survey of fifth class pupils in primary schools that about 10% of these pupils have serious reading difficulties. These surveys, conducted in 1993 and 1998 indicated that there has been no significant change in reading standards over the past 20 years. I have already expressed my deep interest in the area of literacy and I am taking steps to raise the standards of literacy among school children. A large number of measures have already been put in place to address the problem of low literacy levels among school children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment, discussions in my Department about this issue including this proposal from the INTO are in progress. I attach great importance to the development of literacy within the education system and within the adult population in <Col N="1112" /> general. The national reading initiative, established by my Department, conducted a campaign to raise awareness in the community generally of the importance of literacy development. Many groups and agencies within the education sector and in non-governmental organisations and associations are co-operating successfully to improve literacy standards. A considerable number of these groups have had long experience and have been engaged in a range of innovative, pioneering developments. A partnership approach among these various groups could make a positive contribution to improving literacy standards and make a valuable input to policy formulation. Consideration is already being given to establishing such a committee as proposed by the INTO under the national anti-poverty strategy for the next six to seven years. I have, therefore, asked officials in my Department to draw up proposals to see how the experience and creative energies of a variety of groups and individuals can be harnessed to improve literacy standards. I will be making a further announcement on this matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>The establishment of the public service benchmarking body was agreed under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It is a totally independent body, chaired by a high court judge. The public service benchmarking body drew up an operational plan which it agreed with all the parties and this is progressing on schedule. The procedures adopted by the benchmarking body are as envisaged in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and are the same for all groups being examined. These procedures commenced with the delivery of written submissions by both the employers and the relevant trade unions and was followed by the completion of job evaluation questionnaires by a number of randomly selected teachers representing the grades of principal, deputy principal, assistant principal, special duties teacher and teacher. That stage has now been completed and the benchmarking body is currently finalising its own independent research. The findings of this research will be supplied to each party not less than three weeks prior to the commencement of oral hearings by the benchmarking body. The oral hearing for teachers has been scheduled for 4 December 2001. The submissions, research and oral hearings will inform the benchmarking body's deliberations and they will recommend rates of pay for all of the groups, including teachers. One of the essential features of the benchmarking process is that it will look at all of the key public service groups as part of one exercise and that there will <Col N="1113" /> be one comprehensive report. The public service benchmarking body has been asked to produce their report by the 30 June 2002.</P>
      <P>Although employers and unions will have to negotiate the how and when of implementation, they will not be renegotiating the recommendations themselves. An agreement reached between the Government and the trade unions in December 2000 provides for payment of 25% of any increase with effect from 1 December 2001. This will be paid immediately on receipt of the report of the benchmarking body.</P>

      <P>The report of the National Social Work Qualifications Board of July 2000 provides baseline information on social work posts in Ireland, based on a survey of the position as at 1 September 1999. The survey concluded there were not enough qualified social workers available to fill available posts and that an increase in the number of graduates from professional social work courses would be required in order to meet future demand. The report outlined how any increase in training places is intrinsically linked to practice placement opportunities. Quality practice placements are at the core of social work training and constitute some 50% of course time. The report noted a crisis in supply of practice placements due to a lack of formalised structures and resources.</P>
      <P>On foot of this report, my officials are in ongoing discussions with the Higher Education Authority, the Department of Health and Children and the National Social Work Qualifications Board in regard to training places for social workers. The Department of Health and Children is putting arrangements in place to ensure an adequate supply of quality practice placements. A considerable expansion in provision has been agreed, with an extra 35 places being provided for the current academic year and a further 50 places planned for the following academic year, to bring the total number of places available to some 194 with effect from the 2002-03 academic year. The National Social Work Qualifications Board is currently undertaking a follow-up survey on the position pertaining at 1 September 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of a shortage of therapists, the Department of Health and Children commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and <Col N="1114" /> speech and language therapists. The report was launched in July 2001 and it concluded that a major expansion in the numbers of therapy professionals was essential over the next 15 years. In relation to training places, the report recommends an annual increase of 75 training places for both speech and language therapy and occupational therapy and an additional 25 training places in physiotherapy. These increases are in addition to the extra number of places provided by the colleges in the last academic year in response to the request of the Higher Education Authority to expand provision in the light of perceived shortages. The Higher Education Authority invited institutions to submit proposals for the expansion of existing courses and/or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes. The closing date for receipt of such proposals is 15 October.</P>
    <P>I will continue to liaise with my colleague the Minister for Health and Children to ensure an adequate supply of qualified personnel in the three therapy professions and in social work. As to the role of the Higher Education Authority, I can advise the Deputy that the authority is statutorily required to maintain a continuous review of the demand and need for higher education.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the need for regular review and updating of the content and methodologies outlined in school curricula so that young people have opportunities to acquire and develop a broad range of knowledge, skills and attitudes to equip them for adult life in a rapidly changing social and economic environment. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is responsible for the review of curricula and the provision of advice to me on all matters pertaining to curriculum and assessment. The council's structures ensure that consideration of curriculum matters is informed by best educational practice and takes cognisance of the views of educationalists, teachers and parents as well as representatives from business, trades unions, universities and other interests. The Government has recognised the importance of the role played by the council and, in the Education Act 1998, has placed the council on a statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant curricular reform has been undertaken by the NCCA and implemented by my Department in recent years. A revised primary school curriculum was issued to all primary schools in September 1999. The content of the curriculum has been extended and it is firmly grounded in the needs of a changing society. <Col N="1115" /> While core areas such as literacy and numeracy continue to be stressed, important skills and attitudes that equip children to be effective in a changing world receive due emphasis. At every stage of the revised primary curriculum, the emphasis is on group and teamwork, on the personal engagement of the child with his or her learning, and on problem solving. These are all qualities much sought after by employers and are applicable in all aspects of young people's lives.</P>
    <P>Such changes in emphasis have also informed revisions of the post-primary syllabi. The transition year programme helps pupils to attain a level of personal maturity and to acquire personally appropriate learning skills that will serve them through senior cycle and in the workplace. The leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied aim to give students a controlled introduction to the workplace, and to equip them with the skills they will need when they enter the world of work permanently. These programmes help to develop the flexibility required of workers in today's society. All of these programmes also help to ensure that students develop a broadly-based range of competencies in areas of language, mathematics, sciences and arts as well as personal and social skills. Specific attention has been paid to the development of personal and social skills through the development of social, personal and health education and civic, social and political Education. These initiatives have been designed to foster skills and attitudes such as a spirit of citizenship, respect for others, healthy self-esteem and interpersonal skills. These skills enable young people to live fully in the increasingly multi-cultural environment that characterises Irish society and equip them to withstand undesirable peer pressure. Curricular reform has also helped to address issues such as early school leaving. The junior certificate school programme is designed to encourage students to remain in school so that they have opportunities to acquire some qualifications and training &ndash; attributes that are essential requirements for employment in present-day society.</P>
    <P>Considerable curricular reform has been achieved in recent years and curricula are being adapted as necessary. The focus of the work of the NCCA is changing gradually from large-scale review to a smaller-scale rolling review that aims to be responsive to societal change. This will ensure that the need for changes in curricula may be identified and responded to even more speedily than heretofore.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent findings by IBEC that the percentage of males dropping out of school before the leaving certificate is rising; and if so, his response to these findings.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent report published by IBEC entitled &ldquo;Actions For A Learning Society on Lifelong Learning&rdquo; which pointed out, among a range of conclusions, that more males than females leave school early. I assure the Deputy that I share his concern about early school leaving.</P>
      <P>The recently enacted Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 replaced and reformed school attendance legislation. The Act provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service with responsibility for school attendance being given to a newly established body &ndash; the National Educational Welfare Board. The focus of the national authority will be the provision of assistance and support, through locally based educational welfare officers, to schools and families rather than on penalties for non-attendance at school. The Act also includes specific measures for the early identification and support of children at risk of dropping out of the school system. The Act provides measures designed specifically with early school leavers in mind. Section 29 provides that a young person, in most cases 16 and 17 year olds, may register with the National Educational Welfare Board if they leave school before their 18th birthday. The board will then, following consultation with the young person, parents and others, prepare a plan for the young person's continuing education and training. Once that is done the board will issue a certificate to the young person concerned. The overall thrust of the provisions is to place meaningful restrictions on the process whereby young people who are encouraged by an immediate earning potential to leave education and training and take up often low-skill work. The provisions do not prevent young people taking up employment but seek to ensure that a balance is struck between their employment rights and their future educational, training and social needs. My Department is in the process of implementing the Act.</P>
      <P>However, legislative solutions are not in themselves enough. For that reason it is important that we also have in place strategies to encourage and support schools in retaining pupils to completion of senior cycle. In this regard the &ldquo;8-15 Year Old Early School Leavers Initiative&rdquo; was introduced in 1998. One of its key objectives is to test models of response to the problem of early school leaving, with a view to the integration of such models, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice. The projects strand of this initiative currently involves 17 specific projects in 14 areas and is to be expanded later this year to 60 further specific projects. The current initiative was originally introduced for the school years 1998-99 and 1999-2000 and was extended in the existing 17 projects from the period 1 July 2000, until 31 August 2002. Funding of £6.68 million was allocated to this initiative for the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1999 the &ldquo;Stay in School Retention Initiative&rdquo; at second level was launched initially in 58 schools. This marked a significant departure <Col N="1117" /> from traditional policy in that funding of up to £40,000 per annum is being granted to targeted schools, on the basis of plans which they were helped to design themselves. The purpose of this initiative is to prevent early school leaving and raise senior cycle completion rates. There are now 118 schools participating in this initiative. Funding of £10 million was allocated to this initiative for the year 2001.</P>
    <P>The focus of these two initiatives, which form part of the school completion programme, is to target resources at those schools experiencing the greatest difficulties with early school leaving to ensure that the resources are targeted at the schools through which they should reach the greatest possible number of young people at risk. Within the schools involved in the programme, resources are then targeted at the pupils most at risk of early school leaving, irrespective of gender. The prevention of early school leaving is not a simple matter to resolve and in order to have a real chance of success the solutions must be wide-ranging and include strategies for identification, balancing of rights, statutory safeguards and school empowerment.</P>

Work is at an advanced stage within my Department on draft terms of reference for the commission, which will cover a wide range of issues including legal and management structures, developments in education and learning, the role of the teacher, teacher training and accreditation, support systems for schools and teachers and lifelong learning. I will consult shortly with the education partners in relation to these terms of reference as well as the composition and timescale of the commission. It is my intention that the commission would be established once these consultations are completed and I will announce the membership of the commission at that time.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that this question refers to <Col N="1118" /> a vehicle registered in 1983 rather than 1988, as given by the Deputy in the details. The latest information available to my Department regarding the maintenance record of the vehicle since 1998 is given in the following statement. The narrow country roads and pot-holed terrain, over which school buses typically travel, subject the coaches to considerable structural stress, which is a contributory factor in their failure rate. When the bus was off the road, for any reason, other arrangements were made to ensure that the service operated. This vehicle was included in a programmed schedule of preventative maintenance procedures, designed to keep these occurrences to a minimum.</P>
      <P>The question of upgrading the school bus fleet is primarily a matter for Bus Éireann and the private contractors who provide a high proportion of the school bus fleet. As part of its ongoing policy of improving the age and condition of the school bus fleet, Bus Éireann has arrangements in train to purchase more modern vehicles for school transport purposes with an emphasis on replacing the oldest buses in the fleet. In addition, more modern vehicles are being introduced into the school bus fleet on a phased basis as new buses are being introduced on road passenger services. My Department is awaiting details from Bus Éireann of the timescale for the allocation of these more modern vehicles and the implications for the replacement of the vehicle in question. These initiatives will result in a further general improvement in the age and condition of the fleet.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>Since taking office the Government has made very substantial capital investments in the education sector. More than £200 million was allocated for primary and post-primary school capital projects in the year 2000. This was increased to more than £220 million in 2001. The equivalent figure in 1993 was £46.5 million and in 1997, £72.3 million. The Deputies will therefore appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by the Government to the schools building programme at all levels.</P>
      <P>There are currently more than 850 major school building projects at various stages of planning. Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of these projects will be taken in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes in 2002 and subsequent years. In addition, there are in excess of 200 school building projects currently under construction or nearing completion. These projects when completed will result in a substantial improvement in accommodation for the schools in question.</P>

      <P>The ASTI is the only teacher union which is in dispute with my Department at present. The Labour Court issued its recommendation on the ASTI dispute on 9 March and clarified aspects if its recommendation later that <Col N="1120" /> month. The ASTI rejected the findings and are in the course of consulting their members on further action. One of the issues raised during the dispute was supervision and substitution. Discussions on this issue have recently been concluded with the Teachers Union of Ireland and the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland on arrangements for post-primary schools and a final formal offer was put to the two unions on 28 September. The offer included the following elements: additional payment will be made to teachers already employed in the school who volunteer to undertake supervision duties during break times and immediately before and after school; additional payment will be made to teachers already employed in the school who volunteer to provide substitution cover for casual absences of colleagues on sick leave or school business; schools will be provided with funding on the basis of a requirement of 37 hours supervision and substitution per teacher; participation in these duties would be voluntary and payment will be on verified delivery of the service. Payment will be at the rate of £27 per hour inclusive of the 5.5% payable from 1 October 2001. Payments will be made twice yearly.</P>
      <P>The TUI executive has decided to put the offer to a ballot of their members without a recommendation. The result of that ballot will be known on 26 October. The ASTI central executive rejected a recommendation from the standing committee that the &ldquo;Final Offer on Supervision and Substitution&rdquo; should be put to a ballot of members. The central executive also rejected the offer. The CEC decided instead to ballot their members on the withdrawal from all voluntary supervision and substitution. The motion also asks for approval that the <i>status quo </i>continue in relation to voluntary supervision and substitution in schools until a directive is issued pursuant to the outcome of the ballot. A ballot will take place at ASTI branch venues on Tuesday 9 and Wednesday 10 October. The ballots will be counted on Friday 12 October. Discussions with the INTO are continuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of students in third level courses in institutions aided by my Department in 1995-96 was 95,099. The corresponding figure for 1999-2000 was 115,696, an increase of 22%. Specifically at third level, the Government has funded a major increase in the number of places in public colleges and that continues to be a priority. My approach in relation to the maintenance grant schemes has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable <Col N="1121" /> income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. Last June, I approved an increase of 6.5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2001-02 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1999 to March 2000, which was 5.9%. I also increased by 6.5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
      <P>In November last I announced that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third-level students. The project team consists of officials from my Department and the Department of Finance. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has also been commissioned to carry out research including projections for the increased number of grant holders and the cost involved, were the income thresholds to be significantly increased. This review, which is at present in progress, is a wide-ranging review covering many topics. These include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
      <P>There is a provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period 2000 to 2006, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities to third level education. In September 2000, I established the action group on access to third level education to advise me on the most effective ways to increase participation by the three target groups. The group's report, which I launched in July 2001, makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students. The special rates of maintenance grant are aimed at students in disadvantaged circumstances. In order to target those most in need, eligibility is confined to students where family income comes from long-term social welfare payments or from specific schemes such as the community employment scheme.</P>

      <P>The latest information available to my Department regarding the maintenance record of the vehicle in question since 1998 is given in the following statement. The narrow country roads and pot-holed terrain, over which school buses typically travel, subject the coaches to considerable structural stress, which is a contributory factor in their failure rate. When the bus was off the road, for any reason, other arrangements were made to ensure that the service operated. This vehicle was included in a programmed schedule of preventative maintenance procedures, designed to keep these occurrences to a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of upgrading the school bus fleet is primarily a matter for Bus Éireann and the private contractors who provide a high proportion of the school bus fleet. As part of its ongoing policy of improving the age and condition of the school bus fleet, Bus Éireann has arrangements in train to purchase more modern vehicles for school transport purposes with an emphasis on replacing the oldest buses in the fleet. In addition, more modern vehicles are being introduced into the school bus fleet on a phased basis as new buses are being introduced on road <Col N="1123" /> passenger services. My Department is awaiting details from Bus Éireann of the timescale for the allocation of these more modern vehicles and the implication for the replacement of the vehicle in question. These initiatives will result in a further general improvement in the age and condition of this fleet.</P>

The children had been availing of a transport service provided by the local health authority prior to the start of the current school year.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann, which is contracted to operate the special school transport service, is now providing transport for the children in question. I understand that the school authorities have recruited an escort to travel on the service and that this arrangement is working satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>Government policy recognises the need to ensure that pupils in every school have the opportunity to become computer literate. In order to achieve this objective it is necessary to put into place the ICT infrastructure required; ensure that teachers have the appropriate ICT skills; and integrate ICT into the curriculum.</P>
      <P>Since 1998 significant funding has been made available to schools in order to allow them to improve and develop their ICT infrastructure and a large-scale teacher training programme has been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent of the progress to date is highlighted by a recent survey carried out by the National Centre for Technology in Education which shows that the average primary school now <Col N="1125" /> has 8.7 computers, up from 3.8 in early 1998; the average second level school now has 42.7 computers, up from 31 in early 1998; more than 95% of schools state that they are using the Internet, up from only 25% in early 1998; and at least 34,000 teachers have attended one or more IT training courses since early 1998.</P>
    <P>While I am very pleased with progress to date, I am conscious of the need to continue to develop the process. I recently announced significant additional funding which will allow for further ICT infrastructure development in schools and the development of a teacher ICT training programme which will provide a progression path for teachers in developing the skills required for the integration of ICT into the curriculum. The details of this new initiative will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) distinguishes between three types of provision for ICT. First, using ICT as a tool for learning in classrooms; second, specifying desirable levels of competence which students should reach in using ICT; and third, providing a dedicated subject in the curriculum.</P>
    <P>The NCCA has already piloted guidelines for primary schools on integrating ICT into the teaching and learning environment. These are currently being revised, taking account of comprehensive feedback from teachers. The next stage of the process of developing provision for ICT will be to identify, in conjunction with the NCCA, the range of skills and conceptual understanding that pupils should attain through their engagement with ICT right across the curriculum at different levels of education, particularly by the end of the period of compulsory education. This will draw on the best of international practice in this area.</P>
    <P>The NCCA is in the final stages of preparing advice to me on the advisability of introducing a computer based subject at leaving certificate level. This advice will draw upon a feasibility study conducted by the University of Limerick. The purpose of the study was to ascertain the desirability of such a subject, its possible delivery format, potential content and the impact introducing it would have on the current programme at leaving certificate level.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that plans will be developed to evaluate progress as regards computer literacy in schools.</P>

      <P>The report of the Information Commissioner on the implementation of the FOI Act noted that on the whole, the procedures adopted for the processing of requests have been satisfac<Col N="1126" /> tory. However, the commissioner noted a number of instances where practices across public bodies have not met the standards set out in the Act.</P>
      <P>In relation to my Department, the commissioner noted the exceptional circumstances prevailing in regard to the level of requests being received from persons who were formerly resident in industrial or reformatory schools. These requests now account for over 2,000 of the approximately 3,500 requests received by my Department to date.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently working with an external agency to establish a new system to process these requests. This system is intended to ensure that requests made will be answered in a timely manner, that the manner of release of the information is sensitive to the circumstances and history of the individual making the request, and will be able to assist individuals with any further searches that they may wish to carry out, depending on the circumstances and wishes of the requester. There remain some legal issues which require clarification but I hope that the new system can be put in place in the near future.</P>
      <P>The commissioner also noted some other general difficulties in the operation of the Act in my Department, in particular in relation to the dealings with his office. These difficulties have stemmed from the fact that given the heavy volume of requests being received by my Department, the central FOI unit, which also handles liaison with the Office of the Information Commissioner has been under severe pressure to meet all the demands being placed upon it. In terms of dealing with this issue, over the longer term the establishment of a new system to handle requests relating to industrial and reformatory schools will relieve this pressure; in the short term the staffing position in the FOI unit is being reviewed.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn, sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for children aged up to six years. Following its publication, my Department undertook an extensive post-consultation process with interested parties in the sector followed by detailed discussions with specific third level institutions on the implementation of the main proposals in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were no significant delays during this process and I am pleased to say that I have recently appointed St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, and the Dublin Institute of Technology, both of which have considerable expertise in the <Col N="1127" /> area, to undertake a major project to develop and support the provision of quality early childhood education in pursuit of the objectives of the White Paper. The project, which will run for up to three years, will involve the establishment of a centre for early childhood development and education which will be jointly managed by the two institutions and staffed by a suitably qualified professional team. The centre will develop appropriate quality standards in relation to the wide range of issues affecting early childhood education including equipment and material, staff qualifications and training, teaching and learning methodologies, curriculum, guidance for parents and related areas. It will also design and pilot measures to encourage compliance with those quality standards by early education providers.</P>
    <P>A key function of the centre will be to examine and develop appropriate forms of early intervention and support for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and children with disabilities, building on the experience of existing programmes.</P>
    <P>The work of the centre will be undertaken in <Col N="1128" /> close consultation with my Department and the various agencies, advisory bodies and providers in the sector. Funding for the project will be met from the £74 million allocation provided by the Government under the national development plan for the implementation of the White Paper.</P>

    <P>The figures have risen from 1,222 or just under 2% of the total cohort in 1995-96 to 4,250 or 7.3% of the total cohort in the 2000-01 school year. While I do not believe the leaving certificate applied is being taken, as yet, by the full number of students who could benefit from it, the fact that figures have more than tripled since the inception of the programme is very heartening. Efforts are being made by my Department and by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in a variety of ways to increase participation in this excellent programme. These include additional teaching supports, the continued work of the eight person support service in schools, the constant adaptation of the programme to make it more student friendly and the launch of a promotional video.</P>
    <P>Overall, evidence indicates that the leaving certificate applied is impacting positively on retention rates. There is little doubt that in the absence of the programme, many students currently taking it would not complete senior cycle.</P>

The Government has now approved my proposals to accelerate the development of the service to achieve nationwide coverage by the end of next year. This will mean an increase in the number of psychologists employed by the service to 200 by the end of 2002.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that all children with special needs in education are being accommodated; if children with more serious disabilities are accommodated in one of the special schools or special classes attached to ordinary primary schools; if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties that parents experience when their child is recommended for a special school which cannot make the required provision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Children with special needs have access to a range of special education services. My policy is to maximise the extent to which such children can be placed on a fully integrated basis in ordinary schools. However, the extent to which this can be achieved is ultimately determined by the level of special need involved in each individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> In many cases, children with special needs can be accommodated in ordinary schools with the support of the resource teacher or special needs assistant service, or both. The Government has decided that all children with special needs in primary schools should have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. As a result of this development the number of special resource teachers supporting children with special needs in integrated settings in primary schools has been increased from 104 to approximately 1,000. The number of special needs assistants supporting children with special needs has been increased from less than 300 to approximately 2,500 over the same period.</P>
    <P>Where the disability involved is of a more serious nature, the required response may take the form of placement in a special school or a special class attached to an ordinary school. There are more than 100 special schools and approximately 400 special classes in place at present. Each of these is dedicated to a particular disability group and all such facilities operate at the reduced pupil teacher ratios recommended by the Special Education Review Committee. The precise model of provision made available in each case is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
    <P>While every effort is made to arrange appropriate school placements for children with special needs as speedily as possible, I am aware that difficulties arise from time to time in individual situations. My Department will continue to make every effort to resolve any such difficulties so as to ensure that all children with special needs receive the support they require when and where they require it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In answering the Deputy's question, I am including portfolio work, task based work and assignments within the category of project work but not practical tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, project work is an integral part of leaving certificate engineering, construction studies, agricultural science and agricultural economics. In addition, there is a significant amount of project work within the compulsory links modules which are a key feature of the leaving certificate vocational programme. The leaving certificate applied is based on students accomplishing a required number of tasks in the course of the two year programme. All of the above categories of assessment require the student to engage in the achievement of a task or a certain number of tasks. These forms of assessment, which can broadly be regarded as project work, are also included as assessment components, where <Col N="1130" /> appropriate and feasible, in all revisions of syllabi in the established leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>In including project work, practical work and other forms of non-written assessment, for example, oral assessment, in the leaving certificate, due account must be taken of the cumulative burden of assessment on the individual student. Depending on his/her subject choices, a student could find himself/herself with an excessive number of tasks to complete.</P>
    <P>Another major consideration in the introduction of project work, as an integral part of the leaving certificate examination, is the need to ensure that any additional assessment component introduced to any particular subject enjoys the same level of reliability and validity as the modes of assessment already in use. The NCCA, National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, is currently examining the most up to date research in this area. I await the outcome of this research.</P>
    <P>Consideration must also be given to the impact of any increase in the frequency of practical/project assessments on schools in terms of teacher absences to conduct such assessments during the school year.</P>
    <P>I have asked that my Department, in considering an increase in the level of project work, in the context of the revision of the leaving certificate syllabi, to pay particular attention to these considerations and to consult widely with the partners in education before making final recommendations to me.</P>

      <P>One of the indicators set out in the 2001 edition of the OECD's &ldquo;Education at a Glance&rdquo; is the ratio of students to teaching staff based on 1999 data. Ireland's students to teaching staff ratio for all tertiary education is 17.3. This ratio can be compared to a country mean ratio of 15.3. The range in the reported ratios of students to teaching staff is from a low of eight in the case of Iceland, to a high of 26 in the case of Greece.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should note, however, that the OECD advises that such international comparisons at tertiary level should be treated with some caution as it experiences difficulties in calculating full-time equivalent students and teachers on a comparable basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Education Act, 1998, provides that each school board of management must publish the policy of the school concerning admission to and participation in the school, including the policy of the school relating to the suspension or expulsion of students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated, while acknowledging the right of <Col N="1132" /> each child to education in a relatively disruption free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils.</P>
    <P>My Department has issued guidelines to boards of management to assist them in discharging their obligations in the area of school discipline. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of expulsion only as a last resort.</P>
    <P>Under the rules for national schools, no pupil can be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.</P>
    <P>As the issue of suspension and expulsion from school is a matter for each school authority, my Department has no information on the numbers of pupils who may have been expelled or suspended indefinitely since September, 2000.</P>
    <P>The Education Act has also made provision for new appeal procedures, which provide for appeal to the Secretary General of my Department, in order to address grievances at school level, including suspension for more than 20 school days in any school year, or expulsion. These procedures will bring a greater transparency to decisions by schools in relation to long-term suspensions or expulsion and also promote fair procedures at school level. In particular, the right to appeal to a national appeals committee in relation to such decisions by schools will bring a better balance to the rights and obligations of all concerned.</P>
    <P>I have also brought forward a comprehensive range of legislative measures in the Education (Welfare) Act to address generally issues related to school attendance and discipline in schools. The legislation provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board with responsibility for monitoring school attendance on a countrywide basis. The board will employ educational welfare officers, who will be deployed locally to assist all recognised primary and second level schools.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Act provides that where a student is either suspended for a period longer than six days, or misses more than a cumulative total of 15 days in a school year, or displays what the school principal considers to be irregular attendance patterns, the principal shall inform the local educational welfare officer.</P>
    <P>The Act also requires schools to report to their educational welfare officer before expelling any student. In such instances, the role of the educational welfare officer will be to bring together the relevant parties to try and identify a mutually agreeable solution to provide for the education of the student concerned.</P>
    <P>My Department gives assistance to parents <Col N="1133" /> where children are suspended indefinitely or expelled from schools. In cases when its assistance is sought, my Department endeavours, through a process of consultation with the schools and through the inspectorate, to secure a suitable school placement.</P>

      <P>Our higher education system is a binary system, comprising the university sector and the institute of technology sector.</P>

      <P>Prior to October 1998 there were no special classes for children with autism in primary schools. As part of my policy of mainstreaming where possible, 89 special classes dedicated to children with autism are now in place in the primary school system. Each class caters for a maximum of six children and each has the support of a teacher and two special needs assistants. The classes in question can cater for up to 534 pupils with autism. Further such classes are being established in response to identified needs.</P>
      <P>My Department also supports a pilot project in Cork which caters for 30 pupils with autism. This project, which delivers an applied behavioural analysis, ABA, model of response, was established in 1999 and is operating on a five year pilot basis.</P>
      <P>My Department has also sanctioned funding for two further pilot projects using the ABA model of response. These projects have been sanctioned for a three year period and will each cater for 12 children with autism.</P>
      <P>In October 2000 I established a special task force on autism to advise me on the future development of services in this area. I expect that the task force will submit its report by the end of this month.</P>

      <P>While I have not had direct discussions with the management of third level institutions, <Col N="1135" /> there has been considerable progress towards the development of college alcohol policies.</P>
      <P>A joint working group of the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology and the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities was established in 1999 to examine alcohol consumption and to liaise directly with the drinks companies. The work of this group led to the establishment of the national working group which was set up to formulate a framework for college alcohol policy in higher education and to facilitate research being undertaken by the University of Limerick and funded by the Higher Education Authority.</P>
      <P>The national working group operates under the guidance of the Department of Health and Children and has representatives from the universities, institutes of technology and the Union of Students of Ireland. Individual working groups have also been established in each institution supplementing existing work, which many of them have done on this issue. The results of the national working group's deliberations are being made publicly available and a &ldquo;Framework For Developing A College Alcohol Policy&rdquo; is being launched by my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, each of the universities will be launching individual alcohol awareness campaigns later this month, which will complement the national alcohol awareness campaign by the Department of Health and Children which targets young people generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Children (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 157 and 489 together.</P>
      <P>My approach in relation to the maintenance grant schemes has been to follow the practice of recent years and increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage in the previous year. Last June, I approved an increase of 6.5% in the reckonable income limits for the 2001/2002 academic year. This exceeded the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1999 to March 2000, which was 5.9%. I also increased by 6.5% the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly in relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation. Last June, in line with this <Col N="1136" /> policy, I approved increases of 6% in the rates of maintenance grant. The reference value for inflation is the annual percentage increase in the CPI to mid-February 2001. The increase of 6% in grant rates for 2001/02 was higher than the reference value, which was 5.3%.</P>
    <P>Last November, I announced the setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures.</P>
    <P>Some of these topics are, of their nature, complex and require detailed research. For example, costings of the effect of changes in the income limits, below which applicants become eligible for a grant, have been commissioned, and carried out, for the special review.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>

      <P>The Final Report of the Commission on the Points System, which was published in December 1999, represented the culmination of two years of intensive research, discussion and debate on the system of selection for entry to third level education.</P>
      <P>The report recommends that the points system be retained on the basis that it is well established, is broadly fair and transparent and is generally accepted by the public at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All third level institutions set down basic entry requirements for courses they offer and the Commission on the Points System noted that these basic entry requirements differ somewhat in different colleges. In this regard, the commission <Col N="1137" /> recommended that, as far as possible, the institutions should endeavour to ensure that the basic entry requirements across the system are similar. In addition, entry to a small number of courses requires specified grades in certain subjects. The commission recognised that the setting of entry requirements is a key part of the academic freedom of third level institutions. Nevertheless, it recommended that special subject requirements for similar courses should not differ to any great extent and that there should be consultation between my Department and/or the National Council for Curriculum Assessment and the Higher Education Authority before new special entry requirements are introduced by the institutions.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority has been requested to pursue these recommendations with the relevant institutions and I expect to receive a progress report in this regard shortly. In the circumstances, I am sure the Deputy will agree that there is no necessity at present to reconstitute the Commission on the Points System.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries <Col N="1138" /> in primary and secondary schools, and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grants scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and care-</P>
      <P>taking services are provided.</P>
      <P>At second level, in addition to the arrangements outlined above, schools currently receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund. Provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school based community employment, CE, schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post-primary levels are now almost finalised and I expect to be in a position to launch them within the next week. My Department is arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and post-primary schools. These circulars which will be available shortly will outline details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and therefore reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools that used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the <Col N="1139" /> services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from special education section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>The report of the action group on access to third level education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students. The action group considered that the target group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of claimants of long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education, that is, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>The action group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is, students aged 23 and over, but subject to specific conditions, he or she must qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants; total reckonable income, in the tax year to 5 April 2001, must not exceed £7,400, as at 1 April 2001, the applicant's spouse or partner must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments and be in receipt of full rate qualified adult allowance, or similar entitlement, in respect of the applicant, or the applicant must be in receipt of one of the specified social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>It is clear that, in order to target those most in need, the action group wished eligibility for the special rates of grant to be confined to students where family income comes from long-term social welfare payments or, alternatively, from specific schemes such as the community employment scheme.</P>
      <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the higher education <Col N="1140" /> grants scheme is to assist eligible persons, pursuing full-time study, to attain one undergraduate degree and one postgraduate degree. This restriction stems from the objective of promoting equity of access opportunities for students for further and higher education.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, under the terms of the higher education grants scheme funding is not extended to students pursuing a second qualification at the same level. However, there is provision for progression whereby a student may advance from certificate to diploma level and continue to receive grant assistance. Similarly, students progressing from a certificate or diploma to degree level may also continue to be funded.</P>
      <P>In October 2000, I amended the student support schemes to provide for similar progression at postgraduate level. From the 2000-01 academic year, students who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained, may continue to receive grant assistance.</P>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme and the vocational education committees scholarships scheme also provide funding for eligible second chance students who, having attended but not successfully completed an approved course, are returning, following a break of at least five years, in order to pursue an approved course at the same level.</P>

      <P>The group's report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers.</P>
      <P>The report acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level and one of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
      <P>However, included in this report was a recommendation that my Department should examine the feasibility of providing for appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers. Accordingly, the building unit of my Department is examining the possibility of incorporating storage facilities in the provision of furniture in the future. In relation to second level schools, my Department continues to afford schools the option of lockers for book storage in the case of new schools or new extensions for existing schools in line with the report's recommendations. Any applications to my Department for the provision of lockers from existing second level schools that have not applied for any other building work are treated on their own merits and issues such as the possibility of safely incorporating locker space and competing priorities for the funding available for capital work in second level schools must be considered.</P>

The report was launched in July 2001 and it concluded that a <Col N="1142" /> major expansion in the numbers of therapy professionals was essential over the next 15 years. In relation to training places, the report recommends an annual increase of 75 training places for both speech and language therapy and occupational therapy and an additional 25 training places in physiotherapy.

      <P>Recent statistics do not indicate that there has been any decline in the overall numbers entering third level education. Within the university sector the numbers enrolled in full-time undergraduate courses have increased steadily over the past five years. Enrolments have risen from 49,623 in 1996-97 to over 60,000 for the 2000-01 academic year. Similarly, the number of enrolments in full-time courses in the technological sector has increased from 39,260 in the 1996-97 academic year to approximately 48,000 in the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
      <P>It is anticipated, however, that due to declining birth rates there will be a drop in the 17 and 18 year old age cohort. It is also anticipated that the drop in this cohort will be compensated for by increased participation from mature students, students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and students from ethnic and other minority groups. Access initiatives funded by my Department are being directed towards increasing the participation of these groups.</P>
      <P>Academic standards in third level institutions are the subject of ongoing quality assurance procedures and I do not see any danger to academic standards in enrolment trends.</P>

      <P>The applied behavioural analysis, ABA, method is one of a range of models of approach to the education of children with autism. The appropriateness of any approach depends on the assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently funding on a pilot project basis the annual operating costs of three facilities using exclusively ABA based approaches. One such facility, which is based in Cork, was established in 1999 and is operating on a five year pilot basis. Two further ABA based facilities were established, one in Dublin and one in Kill, County Kildare. Both the latter facilities are being funded. The facilities in question are capable of catering for a total of 54 children with autism. The operation of these facilities is being evaluated to determine their effectiveness as models of response to the educational needs of children with autism. The funding to be provided in 2001 for the three facilities in question is estimated at £9,670,000.</P>
      <P>The role of ABA models as a response to the educational needs of children with autism is one of the issues being addressed by the special task force on autism which I established in October 2000 and which is due to report by the end of this month.

      <P>A total of £2.46 million has been provided by my Department in 2001 for child care to support access by early school leavers and unemployed adults to the vocational training opportunities scheme, Youthreach, and senior Traveller training programmes. The measure was introduced in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> A flexible approach has been adopted under which funds are allocated to vocational education committees for direct provision of crèche facilities, including staffing, overheads and refurbishment; purchase of places on existing crèches, with payment of up to £50 per child for full sessions, and <i>pro rata</i> adjustments for shorter sessions; and payment to child minders of up to £50 per week, subject to compliance with tax requirements, and registration as required under the Child Care Act.</P>
    <P>The latest figures available show that 1,050 students on VTOS, Youthreach and senior Traveller training programmes, and 1,308 children are currently benefiting from this scheme. This child care funding is targeted at programmes for early school leavers and unemployed adults. Educational institutions can make applications for child care support in respect of other adult education and training programmes to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which provides crèches directly.</P>
    <P>Feedback initially on the Department of Education and Science scheme has, in general, been very positive. The numbers availing of the programme have risen each year since the scheme's inception and better information regarding tax and welfare implications, together with increased provision of community-commercial crèches has improved the situation in relation to the availability of child care facilities.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Adult Education, Learning for Life, recognises that a national child care programme is an essential pre-requisite to the establishment of a comprehensive adult education programme nationally. Such a national child care infrastructure is now being developed to ensure wide availability of quality, affordable child care. In addition to the funding provided by my Department, as outlined above, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been given responsibility for the co-ordination of the equal opportunities child care programme as part of the National Development Plan, NDP, 2000-2006. A sum of £250 million has been allocated to child care under the NDP, with an additional £94 million of Exchequer funding. The objectives of this strategy are to improve the quality of child care to increase the number of child care facilities and to introduce a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care service.</P>

      <P>The joint declaration of the European Ministers of Education convened in Bologna in June 1999, which was signed by 29 countries, is a commitment to establish the European area of higher education and to promote the European <Col N="1145" /> system of higher education in a global context. The goals of the declaration are to increase the competitiveness of European higher education and to increase mobility and employability within the European area. Recognising the fundamental principles of autonomy and diversity, the establishment of the European area of higher education will be achieved by greater compatibility and comparability of the European systems of higher education.</P>
      <P>The declaration commits the signatories to engage in co-ordinating their policies to achieve the following objectives within the first decade of the third millennium adoption of a system of easily readable and comparable degrees; adoption of a system based on two main cycles, undergraduate and graduate; establishment of a system of credit accumulation and transfer &ndash; such as in the ECTS system &ndash; to promote student mobility; promotion of mobility of students and teachers; co-operation in quality assurance; and promotion of the necessary European dimensions in higher education.</P>
      <P>European Ministers in charge of higher education, representing 32 signatories, met in Prague on 18 and 19 May 2001 in order to review the progress achieved in relation to the Bologna Declaration and to set directions and priorities for the coming years of the process. The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the objective of establishing a European higher education area by 2010.</P>
      <P>The twin principles of institutional autonomy and diversity emphasised in the Bologna Declaration and the Prague Communiqué are well developed in Ireland where our higher education institutions, along with their European counterparts, will be active participants in the achievements of the broad objectives of the declaration. Our higher education system is based on the binary system with complementary roles for the university sector and the technological sector. The diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained so as to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements.</P>
      <P>A steering group representative of all the relevant interests has been established to assist in the formulation of our priorities, in the follow-up to the Bologna Declaration and the Prague conference of Ministers. In that context a national conference on the Bologna Declaration was held on 9 May 2001 and involved all partners in higher education and the wider social partnership.</P>
      <P>The steering group is currently drawing up a questionnaire for distribution to all third level institutions to evaluate the position of each institution <i>vis-à-vis</i> the goals set out in the Bologna Declaration, to identify issues arising and to disseminate information on the Bologna Declaration.</P>

      <P>The financial provision in my Department's Estimates for the general running costs of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has grown from IR£3.42 million in 2000 to IR£7.483 million in the current year. The current year's provision includes a special allocation of IR£1.25 million for a new scheme that I have introduced for the purchase of urgent psychological assessments from private practitioners pending the full development of the NEPS.</P>
      <P>I recently announced plans for the accelerated development of the NEPS whereby additional psychologists will be appointed to bring the number employed by the service to 200 within the next 12 months. I am committed to ensuring that adequate funding will be made available to meet the needs of the expanding NEPS service.</P>

      <P>I established the task force on the physical sciences at both second and third level in October 2000. The brief of the task force is to identify the issues contributing to the falling uptake of the physical sciences and to recommend additional measures to address these issues. The task force submitted its interim report to me in July 2001, and I expect to receive a final report early in the new year.</P>
      <P>A number of institutes of technology have initiated a variety of schemes to encourage students to pursue third level science related courses. These initiatives include local advertising campaigns, career talks at second level schools, induction science days, taster summer school for fifth year students, tutorial support in specific science subject areas and a range of advisory services. Another interesting development is the physics website operated by the Department of Physics in Trinity College Dublin which aims to counter the negative image that physics has among schoolchildren.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, the uptake of science in the junior cycle has remained constant at just under 90% for a number of years. I have undertaken the following steps to address the decline in uptake of the sciences at senior cycle. Revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry were introduced in September 2000, for first examination in June 2002. A new biology syllabus will be introduced in September 2002 for <Col N="1147" /> first examination in June 2004. A new format of examination paper in ordinary level junior certificate science was introduced in the 2000 examination. In leaving certificate physics and chemistry the structure and layout of questions on the ordinary level papers has been revised. A comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry was put in place in September 1999 and is designed to run for three years. An in-career development programme for teachers of biology has been put in place in the current school year. Additional grants for the purchase of laboratory equipment, including ICT equipment, are being provided for schools. Schools that currently have a capital project in architectural planning will have their science laboratories upgraded as an integral element of the capital project. A special annual<i> per capita</i> grant of £10 for pupils taking leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry has been introduced. A revised structure for the junior certificate science syllabus is under consideration by an NCCA course committee. This revision is giving particular attention to the physics and chemistry content of the course. It is proposed that the revised syllabus will be implemented in September 2002.</P>
    <P>The percentages of candidates obtaining less than a D grade in junior certificate science and in each of the three main leaving certificate science subjects, chemistry, biology and physics, are shown in the following table. The table shows the data for the higher level, HL, and ordinary level, OL, in each of the four subjects for the years 1999 to 2001.</P>

    <P>The table shows that, in junior certificate science, the percentages of candidates obtaining less than a D grade are significantly lower this year than in the previous years. This is particularly so in relation to the ordinary level, reflecting the impact of the revised format examination paper introduced in 2000.</P>
    <P>In leaving certificate chemistry and leaving certificate physics the percentages obtaining the lower grades on the ordinary level papers this year are significantly below the 1999 figures. The 1999 figures were in turn much lower than the historical figure for these two papers, which on average was of the order of 20%. This reflects improvements to the structure and layout of the questions on these papers, which were designed to make them more accessible to the candidates. At higher level the percentage for chemistry is very similar to previous years. In physics the per<Col N="1148" /> centage is higher than in the previous years; however, it is still below the historical average of approximately 11%. New syllabi in these subjects will be examined for the first time next year.</P>
    <P>In leaving certificate biology the percentages obtaining the lower grades this year are somewhat higher than in the previous two years, though in the case of the higher level the figure is still below the historical average of approximately 10%. It is expected that the new biology syllabus, to be examined for the first time in 2004, will prove more accessible to candidates.</P>

      <P>Discussions on the issue of supervision and substitution in post-primary schools have recently been concluded with the teachers' unions and a final formal offer was put to the unions on 28 September. The offer included the following elements: additional payment will be made to teachers already employed in the school who volunteer to undertake supervision duties during breaktimes and immediately before and after school; additional payment will be made to teachers already employed in the school who volunteer to provide substitution cover for casual absences of colleagues on sick leave or school business; schools will be provided with funding on the basis of a requirement of 37 hours supervision and substitution per teacher; participation in these duties would be voluntary and payment will be on verified delivery of the service. Payment will be at the rate of £27 per hour inclusive of the 5.5% payable from 1 October 2001. Payments will be made twice yearly.</P>
      <P>The TUI executive has decided to put the offer to a ballot of their members without a recommendation. The result of that ballot will be known on 26 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ASTI central executive has rejected a recommendation from standing committee that the final offer on supervision and substitution should be put to a ballot of members. The CEC has decided to reject the offer. Instead, the CEC decided to ballot its members on the withdrawal from all voluntary supervision and substitution. The motion also asks for approval that the <i>status <Col N="1151" />quo </i>continue in relation to voluntary supervision and substitution in schools until a directive is issued pursuant to the outcome of the ballot.</P>
    <P>A ballot will take place at ASTI branch venues on Tuesday and Wednesday, 9 and 10 October. The ballots will be counted on Friday, 12 October.</P>
    <P>Discussions with the Irish National Teachers Organisation are continuing.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that teachers who are being offered £27 per hour for work which was previously done on a voluntary basis will not opt for a course of action which will lead to disruption in the schools. In the event that teachers opt to withdraw from supervision and substitution, there will be difficulties in schools. However, I will assist school management in every way possible to deal with the situations that arise and to minimise disruption to pupils. My officials are in regular contact with the school management bodies on the most appropriate arrangements to deal with any difficulties which might arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools, and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grants scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per</i></P>
      <P>
        <i>capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and care-</P>
      <P>taking services are provided.</P>
      <P>At second level, in addition to the arrangements outlined above, schools currently receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per school under the school services support fund. Provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently <Col N="1152" /> secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school-based community employment schemes, CE, come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the redistribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post-primary levels are now almost finalised and I expect to be in a position to launch them within the next week. My Department is arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and post-primary schools. These circulars, which will be available shortly, will outline details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and, therefore, reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>
    <P>Finally, schools that used CE participants as classroom assistants to assist with the care of pupils with disabilities should note that my Department has a special needs assistant scheme in place for such purposes. School authorities may apply for the services of a special needs assistant to assist in catering for pupils with special care needs arising from a disability. Further details on the operation of the special needs assistant scheme are available from the Special Education Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, County Westmeath.</P>

      <P>It is already the case that certain decisions of the Labour Court are enforceable. Decisions of the court in relation to appeals of decisions of rights commissioners under the Organisation of Working Time or National Minimum Wage Acts, appeals of decisions of equality officers under equality legislation, dismissal cases under equality legislation and complaints of breaches of registered employment agreements are binding on the parties.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court also operates as an industrial relations tribunal in trade disputes. In such cases, including the one to which I understand the Deputy is referring, the court hears both sides and then issues a recommendation setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it considers the dispute should be settled. While these recommendations are not binding on the parties concerned, the parties are expected to give serious consideration to the court's recommendation. Ultimately, however, responsibility for the settlement of a dispute rests with the parties.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to make the recommendations of the Labour Court in industrial relations disputes legally enforceable.</P>

      <P>The insurance compensation fund levy was introduced on 1 January 1984 following the collapse of PMPA in 1983. The levy ceased to apply from 1 January 1993 as it was felt that sufficient funds had been collected to enable the successful completion of the administration of Primor plc, formerly known as PMPA Insurance plc.</P>
      <P>Levies were paid by all non-life insurers at a rate of 2% of gross premium income until 31 December 1991. The rate was reduced to 1% from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1992. Some £148 million was collected by way of the levy, which is used to finance the administration of Primor plc. The administrator is continuing to run off claims incurred prior to that date under the name Primor plc.</P>
      <P>The Government levy, which at present applies to insurance policies, is a general stamp duty, the proceeds of which go to the Exchequer and not to the insurance compensation fund. Any review of this levy, therefore, is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Experience has shown that a small number of individuals continue to experience difficulties in getting jobs following their participation on community employment. This is usually due to barriers such as age, health, literacy, numeracy or a lack of suitable jobs locally. In recognition of this, I have removed the three-year limit on participation for people over 50 years of age in certain cases. In the future, people over 50 who, having spent three years on the programme, continue to experience difficulties in getting employment, may have their participation in the programme extended. For such participants, FÁS will have discretion to offer a further period on the programme on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>FÁS has also been given the flexibility to offer a further period of participation of up to one year for those in the younger age groups who are also experiencing difficulty in obtaining employment. This flexibility will apply in those cases where it is clear that an extension would be of benefit to the participants in terms of improving their prospects of progressing to a job in the open labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following guidelines on the operation of the changes in CE policy have been issued to FÁS by my Department: over 25s on part-time integration option &ndash; current FÁS discretion to give participants an extra year is increased from 10% to 20% to meet the needs of individuals who would clearly benefit from such extension in <Col N="1165" /> terms of their future employment prospects; 35s to 50s on part-time job option &ndash; FÁS will have discretion to give 20% of participants in this age group extensions of up to one year to meet the needs of individuals who would clearly benefit from such extension in terms of their future employment prospects; over 50s on part-time job option &ndash; FÁS will have discretion to give 20% of participants in this group a further year on CE, with provision for review at the end of that year. Further discretion will apply to extend participation beyond this on a case by case basis, subject to continued annual review; and FÁS discretion to provide extensions on a case by case basis will be applied only to those participants who, on reaching the end of their period of normal entitlement, still experience difficulties in getting jobs, whether due to age, health, literacy, numeracy, or a lack of suitable jobs locally.</P>
    <P>The new rules for the operation of CE will be applied strictly within existing budgetary constraints and the overall target for restructuring the programme, as required under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>Section 32 of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1999, already enables certain companies, which meet specific criteria, to avail of an exemption from the requirement to have their accounts audited. In brief, the exemption is available to certain private limited companies, including those formed by community groups, which meet the following thresholds: a turnover not exceeding £250,000 per annum; a balance sheet total not exceeding £1,5 million; a number of employees not exceeding 50 persons; and other specified qualifying criteria.</P>
      <P>While I propose to monitor the extent to which the exemption is availed of, I do not have any proposals to amend the criteria or extend the scope of the exemption at this time.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that as many community groups receive financial assistance or grants from State bodies, they may be required to have their annual accounts audited as a condition of receiving this financial assistance and, therefore, may not be in a position to avail of the audit exemption.</P>

I would point out that insurance cover is provided through the marketplace by individual private insurance companies that offer cover on the basis of their assessment of the risk.</P>

      <P>There are currently in the region of 31,500 participants on community employment schemes &ndash; CE. Following a restructuring of the programme approved by the Government in 1999, participation levels are gradually being reduced to 28,000 by the end of 2003 as part of a phased reduction reflecting the falling numbers of the long-term unemployed. The mainstreaming of schools services currently under way and the proposed mainstreaming of other essential services, including health and environmental sectors, will further reduce the numbers employed on the programme. Mainstreaming of CE services will provide new employment opportunities for CE participants and other long-term unemployed persons.</P>

      <P>I understand that Mr. Ray Jackson of KPMG was appointed as liquidator to Irish ISPAT Limited on 28 June 2001 and that the liquidation process is under way. My Department has paid over £1.5 million in statutory redundancy to the former employees of Irish ISPAT. Minimum notice claims in respect of former employees were heard by the Employment Appeals Tribunal in Cork on 18 September 2001, and the decision of the tribunal is expected in the very near future. Claims for outstanding wages and holiday pay to a total of over £432,000 have also been paid under the insolvency payments scheme. The claims for minimum notice compensation and outstanding occupational pension fund contributions are expected shortly.</P>
      <P>Following the closure of Irish ISPAT, the Government approved, at my request, a proposal to seek funding from the European Coal and Steel Community &ndash; ECSC &ndash; to enhance the statutory entitlements of workers made redundant as a result of the closure of the steel plant. My Department then applied to the European Commission for ECSC re-adaptation aid under Article 56(2)(f2&gt;b) of the ECSC treaty for the ISPAT workers and also for certain on-site contract workers who were made redundant as a result of the closure of Irish ISPAT and who qualify for aid under ECSC rules. It is expected that a formal decision on the application will be made by the European Commission in November. Part of the conditions for receipt of ECSC aid is that the member state concerned should pay a special contribution to the redundant workers which would at least match the amount to be paid by the Commission. The Government has agreed to the provision of this matching funding.</P>
      <P>There are currently 132 IDA Ireland assisted companies in Cork employing a total of 18,174 people. The Cork area has become a major centre for the software development industry. The major focus of IDA Ireland for 2001 and beyond will be to attract new business to regional locations such as West Cork Technology Park, Clonakilty, Charleville, and to continue to promote the IDA Ireland site at Ringaskiddy. IDA Ireland currently owns 400 acres of serviced land at Ringaskiddy and this is being promoted for future foreign direct investment including the pharma and biotechnology industry.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has extended its industrial site in Carrigtwohill by 70 acres and this is in the catchment area of Cobh. Last year two of the foreign companies there announced expansion projects, Millipore, 220 jobs, and Stryker Corporation, 200 jobs. Both of these companies are currently recruiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key feature of Enterprise Ireland's regional development strategy, which I launched last Feb<Col N="1169" /> ruary, is creating and sustaining enterprise in the regions. There is a strong upward employment trend in Enterprise Ireland companies in the Cork city and county area. The figures for last year, which are the latest available, show a net gain of 1,903 jobs in the area in these companies. Over the past three years there has been a more balanced regional dispersal of investment with new and expansion projects locating in Carrigtwohill, Bandon, Mallow, Dunmanway and Clonakilty. IDA Ireland's work of promoting the region has been well supported by the excellent third level educational facilities in the region, the vastly improved physical infrastructure in the greater Cork area and some peripheral towns, the improving telecommunications services and supportive local authorities.</P>

I cannot therefore legally introduce controls on scales of premiums.

The high transaction cost of claims, particularly legal costs, has been identified as one of the major factors driving up the cost of personal injury settlements. The decision of the Government to establish a personal injuries assessment board, seeks to address the issue of the high cost of settling claims, by achieving a reduction in the delivery cost of personal injury compensation.</P>

I understand that over a long period of time the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has drawn attention to a number of deficiencies at this particular company's premises. It resulted in the Department issuing a notice temporarily suspending production at the plant. However, that Department is prepared to co-operate in every possible way with the company's efforts to re-open its plant. This was reiterated to the company by that Department at a meeting last Friday.</P>
      <P>I have discussed the employment situation in the county with the industrial development agencies. The availability of an advance factory is important and IDA Ireland has secured planning permission for a 25,000 sq. ft. factory. The objective is to secure a client at the earliest date. Enterprise Ireland is focusing on the development of County Monaghan's food processing sector and the development of an integrated food enterprise park will enhance the county's reputation in this regard.

      <P>Bray coastal protection scheme consists of three phases. Phase 1 consisted of the construction of a rock groyne and breakwater and was completed in July 1999 at a cost of £1,839,446.20, including VAT. Phase II consisted of the placing of beach nourishment on Bray beach and was completed in January 2001 at a cost of £2,286,493.32, including VAT. Phase III consists of repair and remedial work to south pier wall at Bray Harbour and is currently in progress at a contract cost of £973,190.93, including VAT.</P>
      <P>Planning permission was received for the placing of a total volume of 250,000mf7&gt;3 of sand and gravel on Bray beach. In the event, a total volume of 234,767mf7&gt;3 was placed on the beach. I am advised by the engineering staff who worked on this project that ceasing filling at the exact limit of the planning permission would have left a discontinuity on the beach surface which would have been a public safety hazard. In addition, the realities of beach engineering are such that stopping work of this nature at a particular artificial line is extremely difficult because of the dynamic nature of beach sediment and the manner in which the nourishment material is placed, that is, as a pumped mixture of water and gravel. For safety and technical reasons therefore an engineering decision was made while the contractor was still on site to rework material at the southern limit of the works to merge smoothly into the existing beach material and this work of necessity took place on the area of foreshore south of the bandstand beyond the technical parameter for which planning permission was received. There were no cost implications for the project.</P>

      <P>The primary impacts of this scheme are that it secures the structural stability of Bray promenade which was at risk of collapse due to undermining and that it effectively eliminates wave overtopping of Bray promenade which was a significant danger to the public and gave rise to flooding which caused severe disruption to the town of Bray. In relation to swimming safety, I am advised that beach slopes on the new beach are as anticipated and are similar to the slope on the north beach, Greystones. Following an inspection at low tide this summer no steep drops, <Col N="1173" /> which could pose a hazard to swimmers, were observed on the new beach. Wave generated local currents and local scour can arise at the head of the rock groyne and rock breakwater and could prove a hazard to swimmers. Bray Urban Council has been advised of this matter. I am advised that the coast protection scheme is not a contributing factor in any way to the current blue flag status of Bray beach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The coastal protection scheme at Bray seafront has only been in place for eight months and it is too early to draw conclusions about its performance. Beach nourishment schemes by their nature require regular maintenance works. My Department's engineering division advises, that in the case of Bray, because of the relatively contained nature of the replenishment scheme, it is expected that routine maintenance will be restricted to minor redistribution or recycling of material. What may appear to be erosion is merely the adjustment of the new beach to prevailing conditions.</P>
      <P>A natural beach will have been reworked over time by wave action leading to a stable structure with finer material at the water's edge grading up to coarser material at the upper beach. A nourished beach has a range of material at all positions on the beach and reworking of this material, particularly by storms, will be the dominant behaviour mechanism and, in time, will yield an equilibrium beach profile. This process will take a number of years and in the case of Bray beach will move the beach crest back towards the promenade. My Department is putting a regime in place to monitor the response of Bray beach to storms. About one year of data will be required to make definitive statements in relation to actual performance.</P>

      <P>The original application related to a total area of 22.7 hectares of which of 16.7 hectares was described as unenclosed land and six <Col N="1174" /> hectares was described as enclosed land. Unenclosed land attracts a lower rate of forestry premium. Following discussions between the applicant's professional forester and the forest service inspector it was agreed that unenclosed was the correct classification for all of the land. However, in the formal letter of approval issued by the forest service it was incorrectly stated that six hectares of the 22.7 hectares was enclosed, as described in the original application. The grant and premium claim was submitted by the applicant on the basis of the factual position, that is, all of the area was described as unenclosed, and was paid accordingly. It is a matter of regret that the formal letter of approval was inaccurate, no doubt this led to some confusion. There is no doubt, however, on the basis of discussions between the applicant's professional forester and the forest service inspector, and also from the claim submitted by the applicant subsequently, that the land was all classified as unenclosed.</P>

However, the Government proposes to provide Exchequer funding for increases in all forestry premia for recipients who planted during the period 1993 to 1999, subject to the approval of the European Commission. The Commission's decision is expected shortly.</P>

Under this scheme, citizenship by means of a certificate of naturalisation could be conferred on foreign nationals by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in return for substantial investment in the State. Persons who were granted citizenship in this way were eligible to apply for and obtain Irish passports.

      <P>I, along with my EU partners, have raised our concerns with the Indonesian authorities on a number of occasions. Most recently, at the General Affairs Council on 14 May 2001, we called on and encouraged the Indonesian Government to make further urgent efforts to address and resolve peacefully the various conflicts in Indonesia, including Irian Jaya. We have been closely monitoring the situation in Irian Jaya, particularly since Mrs. Megawati Sukarnoputri took over as President of Indonesia. Later this year EU heads of mission in Jakarta plan to undertake a fact finding mission to the province to evaluate at first hand the situation there.</P>
      <P>In order to address the fundamental causes of tension in Irian Jaya, the Government, as well as the EU, supports an approach aimed at promoting greater decentralisation and autonomy, based on dialogue and negotiations between the local authorities and the authorities in Jakarta. This should include an effort by the Indonesian authorities to exercise full and proper control over the security forces in Irian Jaya to ensure that the human rights violations of which they are accused are investigated and the perpetrators prosecuted, and above all, that such abuses be brought to an end.</P>

An <Col N="1177" /> evaluation carried out by Bord Gáis has determined that this would require grant aid, as the demand for gas in the long-term would not be sufficient to pay for the capital cost of extending the system. Such grant aid would require State aid clearance from the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>Last month the Government announced that it was moving ahead with the next stage in the project, which is to conduct a detailed study on extending the gas network to Sligo <i>via</i> Ballina from the proposed Mayo/Galway pipeline and to Letterkenny from Derry, which is expected to be served by a pipeline from Belfast. Bord Gáis is being asked to carry out this study, the purpose of which is to fully define the pipeline extensions and to give an accurate assessment of the levels of grant aid necessary.

      <P>On the evening of the attacks on the US, members of the Cabinet were briefed by the security committee on the security precautions which had been put in place arising from those attacks. They were also briefed on the Department of Foreign Affairs humanitarian efforts to trace relatives who might have been caught up in the attacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The security committee includes the Secretaries General to the Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of <Col N="1179" /> Defence, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and the Garda Commissioner. A high level contact group, chaired by Department of the Taoiseach and comprising representatives of the Garda, the Defence Forces and the Departments immediately concerned, was set up to monitor developments and emergency services were asked to ensure their arrangements were fully up to date.</P>
    <P>Since then the security committee has met on a number of occasions and the high level contact group has also met regularly. At the Government meeting on 18 September 2001, arising from a report of the contact group, Ministers were asked to ensure that all necessary measures were being taken to monitor and respond to the evolving international situation.</P>
    <P>In support of the emergency planning authorities in updating their emergency plans it was arranged that the contact group would seek to identify specific additional threats which needed to be taken on board in revised emergency plans. At a meeting in the Department of the Taoiseach of key Departments and agencies involved in emergency planning, arrangements were made for Defence Forces ordnance experts to assist planning authorities in their review of existing plans to take account, as appropriate, of the chemical and biological weapons threat.</P>
    <P>A review of the structures under which emergency planning is conducted has taken place. The attacks on the US have clearly changed the context for such emergency planning. Since the 1980s, the emphasis in planning was on peacetime emergencies, whereas now we are faced with new threats arising from global terrorism. In those circumstances the Government has decided to set up an office of emergency planning in the Department of Defence. The new office will take the lead role in emergency planning to meet the new threat from international terrorism and from any escalation in international tensions, including co-ordination of the responses by the various agencies involved, and exercise an oversight role in relation to peacetime planning in order to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements. The existing lead role of Departments in respect of specific emergency planning arrangements will of course continue. I am, accordingly, the Cabinet Minister with responsibility for the foregoing.</P>
    <P>While there is in place an extensive framework of peacetime emergency plans, it is now clear that the assumptions on which emergency planning are currently based need to be reviewed to take into account the possibility, however remote, of chemical and biological attacks on this State and its people or on neighbouring countries which could indirectly impact on this State. The lead responsibility for specific emergency planning functions will remain with the relevant Departments and the high level contact group, established in the wake of the events of 11 September, will in future be convened by the Department of <Col N="1180" /> Defence to support the office of emergency planning.</P>

      <P>A comprehensive integrated action area plan was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. That plan provides for a wide range of community, amenity, residential and commercial uses for the property. The development of the Murphy Barracks lands will be critical in the future overall development of the town of Ballincollig.</P>
      <P>My Department submitted the integrated plan to Cork County Council in April of last year for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork County development plan. I understand that the matter was on the agenda of a recent meeting of the council and no objection was raised to the adoption of the plan. A final decision on the matter is expected in the near future.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Clancy Barracks was advertised by the selling agents, Hamilton Osborne King, for sale by public tender on 14 June 2001.</P>
      <P>Prior to advertising the property for sale, meetings were held between my Department and Dublin Corporation and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The view of the corporation and the Department of the Environment and Local Government was that the optimal solution would be to sell the land on the open market rather than have it purchased by the local authority for housing purposes. The corporation submitted a tender which was too low to permit its acceptance.</P>
      <P>My Department is, of course, prepared to talk to any party interested in purchasing the property, which remains on the market. It is my intention to generate the maximum return from the site for re-investment in essential Defence Forces needs.</P>

      <P>The Government's response to the final report of the commission on public service pensions was announced by the Minister for Finance on 28 September 2001. The Government has decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and intends to establish the working group to advise on implementation as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operational details of the implementation <Col N="1182" /> of the commission's recommendations will be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from the implementation working group, to be made within six months of this decision. Parallel structures, subject to the same time frame and remit, will be established in the case of members of An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces. Arrangements will also be made to facilitate pensioner group representation in relation to the commission's recommendations on pensions increase policy.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department of Finance is in discussion with the public services committee of the ICTU regarding union representation on the implementation working group. My Department is keeping in touch with developments in that regard with a view to progressing the establishment of the parallel structures for the Defence Forces as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of reckoning military service allowance, MSA, in the calculation of the pensions of pre-August 1990 Defence Forces pensioners, the position is that the approach adopted when MSA was first made pensionable was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners. The commission on public service pensions specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances, including MSA, and the consequences for pensioners generally in its final report but, having assessed the arguments involved, did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned. No change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised in the context of the Government's consideration of the commission's final report.</P>

This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third, for search and rescue purposes, as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
      <P>Tenders were invited on 5 March 2001 and the closing date was 19 April 2001. Four tenders were received. The four companies involved are Sikorsky from the USA, EH Industries Limited from England, Eurocopter from France and CHC</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The tenders received are being subjected to a comprehensive evaluation process which included visits to each of the four companies involved.

The team's report will be examined by my Department to ensure policy and procedural compliance, after which negotiations will be entered into with a selected contractor.</P>
    <P>The tender competition for the supply of the helicopters is being carried out under EU contracts procedures. The award of contract criteria set out in the tender documentation states that the contract will be awarded on the basis of the most strategically and economically advantageous tender applying the following award criteria, not necessarily in order of priority: functional characteristics; technical merit; all maintenance and on-line technical support; after sales service and warranty terms on offer; cost and ready availability of spare parts; tender prices; life cycle costs over a nominal 20 year period.</P>

      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land <Col N="1184" /> parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
      <P>The new area based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped, lowland &ndash; £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped, lowland &ndash; £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; mountain type land &ndash; £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named has been paid a total of £2,782.33 under the area based compensatory allowance scheme in respect of 3.29 hectares of more severely handicapped lowland at £70 per hectare and 56.71 hectares of mountain type land at £45 per hectare. As the amount paid was greater than his average headage payment of £1,046.00 over the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, no compensation for loss under the area based scheme is due.</P>
      <P>The scheme is currently under review with a view to finding the most equitable arrangements with particular reference to farmers with mountain type land.</P>

      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing <Col N="1189" /> suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes. However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place.</P>
      <P>The new area based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped, lowland &ndash; £70 per hectare up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped, lowland &ndash; £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; mountain type land &ndash; £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
      <P>The person named was paid £2,200.57 on 24 September 2001 in respect of 48.90 hectares of mountain type land at £45 per hectare. As the amount paid was greater than his average headage payment of £1,640.00 over the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, no compensation for loss under the area based scheme is due. The scheme is currently under review with a view to finding the most equitable arrangements with particular reference to farmers with mountain type land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1997, a review of mountain type grazing lands for sheep headage purposes in the more severely handicapped areas and the less severely handicapped areas was carried out by my Department. All land classified as mountain type grazing was subsequently identified as such on the land parcel identification system. This designation as mountain type grazing suited most farmers, especially those engaged in sheep production, allowing them to be paid headage grants on mountain type ewes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in designating the areas concerned on the land parcel identification system regard had to be had to certain natural boundaries such as rivers and roads and it was not possible to exclude certain farms where sheep production did not take place. The new area based compensatory allowance scheme agreed in July 2000 and approved by the European Commission in the context of the CAP rural development plan provides for area related payments as follows: more severely handicapped, lowland &ndash; £70 per hectare <Col N="1194" /> up to 45 hectares; less severely handicapped, lowland &ndash; £60 per hectare up to 45 hectares; mountain type land &ndash; £45 per hectare up to 60 hectares.</P>
    <P>The person named was paid £687.15 on 24 September 2001 in respect of 15.27 hectares of mountain type land at £45 per hectare, together with an additional sum of £80.09 under a compensation package agreed with the European Commission for farmers experiencing losses under the 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme. The additional sum is equal to 90% of the difference between the average sum of the headage payments under the 1998, 1999 and 2000 headage schemes and the amount paid under the 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme is currently under review with a view to finding the most equitable arrangements with particular reference to farmers with mountain type land.</P>

      <QRef>[23135/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265, 266 and 269 together.</P>
      <P>The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland &ndash; ECBI &ndash;  aims to use its resources as cost-effectively as possible. To this end, the ECBI uses independent professional surveys on public awareness to inform the content of its public information, including advertising, campaigns, and to identify groups most at risk of low awareness of the euro. The ECBI also uses a specialist media-buying agency in selecting the media to be used to convey its advertising messages in the most cost-effective way, both to the public generally and to low awareness groups. The board uses television, radio, press and outdoor advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the press area, the ECBI was advised by its media buying agency that it is more cost-effective to use the mass circulation of national newspapers to communicate messages on the euro to the public as a whole, and low awareness groups, and so the focus of press advertising has been on the national press. The paid provincial press has been used on occasion to supplement the com<Col N="1200" /> munication of key messages, in view of the role of such press in regional areas. As regards Dublin, not all households receive a local newspaper, so that use of the newspapers suggested by the Deputies would still have to be accompanied by national newspaper advertising, with a resultant impact on cost effectiveness. In addition, the ECBI is advised that its advertisements are already seen by an extremely high proportion of Dublin people. It is also relevant to point out that the board has received over 150 requests for print advertisements.</P>
    <P>Finally, the board provides information extensively by non-advertising means, including direct to households as well as through other mechanisms. In this context, I would point out that the board has sent a leaflet to every household every year since its establishment in 1998 and is distributing a 24 page handbook on the changeover to every household in the State during October.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the level at which VAT is levied on hurleys; the amount that was collected by the State on the sale of hurling sticks in 2000; the projected amount in 2001; the plans he has to reduce or eliminate VAT on sporting items such as hurleys; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. The 20% standard rate of VAT applies to the purchase of hurleys and to a wide range of goods and services. Information is not collected in respect of VAT which would allow for the VAT yield from hurleys to be determined. It is not possible therefore to give an indication of the yield in 2000 or 2001.</P>
      <P>Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates they had in place on 1 January 1991, but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates. As hurleys were not zero rated on 1 January 1991, it is not now possible to apply a zero rate to them. EU VAT rules also determine the extent to which items can be reduced rated. While the directive provides for reduced rating of certain goods and services, in certain circumstances, this does not apply to the purchase of sporting items such as hurleys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department is involved in several measures relating to the issue of under-age drinking.</P>
      <P>Education programmes have been developed so that young people may be more informed and better equipped to make informed decisions when faced with the issue of alcohol. Children are targeted through the substance misuse prevention programme called &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo; which was developed and delivered in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science and the health boards and of course the teachers. Training in this programme has now been received by 95% of primary schools. Adolescents are targeted through the substance abuse prevention programme &ndash; SAPP &ndash; called &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; which forms part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. To date, two-thirds of post primary schools have received training in this programme. The SAPP programme is also available for youth leaders working in local communities and at risk youth groups. Training is available for professionals and parents at community level through the regional health boards, with the purpose of helping long-term prevention of alcohol and drug misuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A training initiative developed in association with the drinks industry on the responsible serving of alcohol has been established. This is a training course for those in the pub trade and hospitality industry and was developed in co-operation with the drinks industry group and <Col N="1203" /> CERT. Some of the issues addressed in this programme are the prevention of serving those under-age, those who are going to drink and drive and those who are already intoxicated.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit commissioned the first national lifestyle surveys, &ldquo;Survey of Lifestyle, Attitudes and Nutrition&rdquo; and &ldquo;Health Behaviour in School Aged Children&rdquo;. They provide a profile of health related behaviours including current drinking patterns. The first report was published in 1999. Follow-up surveys will be conducted at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>Research material is currently being finalised in relation to the impact of alcohol advertising on young people, the results of which are expected in the near future. This research will inform future policy in this area.</P>
    <P>As part of the &ldquo;Less is More&rdquo; alcohol awareness campaign, the health promotion unit of my Department held a special seminar which was attended by over 100 stakeholders: health professionals, youth groups, teachers, parents, community groups, vintners and the Garda. At local level, the Department is working with youth leaders and health professionals in each of the health board areas to identify best practice initiatives within communities that promote awareness of alcohol to young people. Many of the health boards have already developed successful programmes to tackle some of the issues and my Department will be supporting the continuation of these.</P>
    <P>Part of this campaign involved a phase which focused on those who buy or supply alcohol to those under-age. It comprises of a poster which was displayed at alcohol outlets nationally and a series of radio messages. The theme is keeping children safe from drink and alerts people to their part in dealing with this problem. This phase coincided with the summer holiday season and examination results.</P>

      <P>Other service providers receive an annual capitation grant in respect of each sheltered worker.

In recent years my Department has recognised the need to increase funding to the providers of sheltered work. In this context, additional funding was provided to the health boards as follows: 1999, £2.1 million &ndash; 2.666 million; 2000, £2.1 million &ndash; 2.666million; and 2001, £3.35 million &ndash; 4.253million effective from 1 April, with a full year cost of £5.35 million &ndash; 6.793 million in 2002.</P>
      <P>My Department will shortly be undertaking a review of funding of sheltered workshops. I expect this review to be completed early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up until December 1999 capital funding for sheltered workshops was provided by a combination of European Regional Development Fund  <Col N="1205" />&ndash; ERDF &ndash; and Exchequer funding. Since January 2000 capital projects for sheltered workshops are provided through national development plan funding.</P>

      <P>The guidelines governing the recruitment and selection of students for the nursing registration-diploma programme provide that meals will be available to students on a seven day per week basis without charge in designated health board-hospital restaurant(s). Under the previous apprenticeship training programme, first year student nurses were provided with meals and accommodation; therefore, there was funding in the health board-hospital base allocations to meet part of the costs of providing meals to the students on the nursing registration-diploma programmes. Prior to the commencement of the diploma programmes the health boards-hospitals agreed to meet the remainder of the costs themselves.</P>
      <P>The integrated school of general and psychiatric nursing at Castlebar was established last year. Since Castlebar was a greenfield site in terms of nursing training, there was no funding in the hospital base to meet the cost of providing meals. My Department entered into negotiations with the Western Health Board and agreed to provide £1,000 &ndash; 1,269.74 &ndash; per student per annum to be paid to the students in lieu of meals. A similar funding arrangement was put in place at Tralee General Hospital and at St. Brigid's Hospital, Ardee, County Louth, both of which also commenced the nursing diploma programme in 2000. Funding for meals has also been provided for St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire which commenced the nursing diploma programme in 2001.</P>
      <P>I understand that some of the schools of nursing have entered into a local arrangement to provide a cash or voucher alternative to the provision of meals within their existing resources. My Department has no objection to such arrangements provided that the agreement of the nursing students and the relevant nursing unions is obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Western Health Board recently decided to pay nursing students at University College Galway Hospital a meal allowance because it was not in a position to provide them with meals due to building works at the hospital. The health board has informed my Department that this is an exceptional temporary measure as a result of the closure of the canteen facilities. The nursing <Col N="1206" /> students in the University College Galway Hospital will revert to the usual situation of free meals in the canteen facilities as soon as the building works are completed.</P>

      <P>As I have previously informed the Deputy, the provision of housing modification grants for people with physical disabilities is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local <Col N="1208" /> Government and they are provided through the relevant local authority. The criteria for this scheme are set out in the Department of the Environment and Local Government's Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant) Regulations, 1993.</P>
      <P>The housing modifications-adaptations required vary according to the level of disability involved in each particular case. It is, therefore, necessary for a trained professional, that is, an occupational therapist, to identify the most suitable modifications which will allow the individual to function adequately within the home. Without these modifications, some everyday functions may be difficult or impossible to carry out due to the nature of the particular disability. Health boards are involved with these grants to the extent that an assessment of the individual case must be carried out by an occupational therapist from the health board, in order for the grant to be approved.</P>
      <P>The assessment procedure involved in the processing of these grants is entirely a matter for discussion between the local authority and the health board concerned. A copy of the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board for his attention.</P>
      <P>In response to my concern regarding current labour shortages affecting the therapy professions nationwide my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists including occupational therapists. The study, a comprehensive quantitative assessment of workforce requirements for qualified personnel in this area to 2015, was published on 25 July last.</P>
      <P>The report concludes that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years, including an increase of over 150% in occupational therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 course places for occupational therapy. Other key recommendations of the report include:</P>
      <P>Provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; </P>
      <P>Need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; </P>
      <P>Concerted recruitment from overseas; </P>
      <P>Establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; </P>
      <P>Career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions, published in April 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1209" /> I am working closely with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science to ensure the rapid provision of the additional places as an urgent priority. To this end an inter-agency working group has been established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority &ndash; HEA. The Higher Education Authority has initiated a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions to respond to the training needs identified in the study.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million  &ndash; 6.729 million &ndash; has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million  &ndash; 4.698 million &ndash; is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million  &ndash; 2.971 million &ndash; this year for orthodontic services of which £1.61 million  &ndash; 2.044 million &ndash; was for the orthodontic initiative. The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised me of the following developments in the authority in relation to its initiative to improve its orthodontic services: two additional consultant orthodontists have been appointed. The first has been assigned to the East Coast Area Health Board and the second has been appointed to the South-Western Area Health Board; the recruitment of a consultant orthodontist for the Northern Area Health Board is currently in train; two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and a further recruitment drive is in progress to recruit four more; the recruitment process for three man<Col N="1210" /> agers to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards has been completed and the successful candidates have taken up their duties; interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board have been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidates is almost finalised. A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards will be organised in the near future; a competition to fill the post of dental hygienist in the East Coast Area Health Board has been completed and the recruitment of the successful candidate is currently in train. A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health hoards will be organised in the near future; the previously vacant post of superintendent radiographer at the regional orthodontic unit in St. James's Hospital unit has been filled. A similar post for the Loughlinstown unit has been filled on a permanent basis; a six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is now open. The treatment of patients there has commenced; the equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St James' Hospital orthodontic unit is being completed and it will be operational in the near future; the Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial Hospital; validation of existing waiting lists is currently in progress; agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics. Four dentists for the ERHA will commence training in 2001.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the chief executive officer of the ERHA that at the end of the June 2001 quarter, there were 3,297 patients in orthodontic treatment in the authority. I am further informed by the chief executive officer of the ERHA that there were 4,456 patients on the assessment waiting list in the SWAHB at the end of the June 2001 quarter.</P>

      <P>On 1 August 2001 I published the new Public Health (Tobacco) Bill, 2001, to give effect to the proposals in the Government's policy document Towards a Tobacco Free Society. I propose to introduce the Bill in the Dáil at the earliest possible date. I intend using enabling powers under section 46 of the Bill to extend environmental controls on smoking to a range of public areas and public facilities not already covered by existing legislation and regulation, including pubs.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned over the involuntary exposure of persons to environmental tobacco smoke or passive smoking. Numerous studies have shown that environmental tobacco smoke &ndash; ETS &ndash; is a cause of acute and chronic diseases in non-smokers. There is no evidence of a safe exposure level. Only 15% of the smoke from cigarettes is inhaled by the smoker and the remainder is released directly into the air. Tobacco smoke contains about 4,000 chemicals of which at least 60 are known carcinogens. Nobody should be involuntarily exposed to the hazards of ETS.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I met representatives of one of the vintners associations and made clear to them the need to provide smokefree areas for customers and staff.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 293 and 294 together.</P>
      <P>The hospital in-patient waiting times, the numbers on waiting lists and the number of patients awaiting orthodontic treatment in the Midland Health Board as at 30 June 2001 are being communicated separately to the Deputy. Out-patient waiting list data are not routinely collected by my Department.</P>
      <P>National waiting list information is collated by my Department from data supplied by health agencies and is broken down by the total number of adults and children waiting for procedures at the hospitals within their respective areas. Cardiac surgery is performed in three Dublin hospitals and at Cork University Hospital. The total number waiting for cardiac surgery at 30 June 2001 was 420.</P>
      <P>The overall number of patients on waiting lists at 30 June 2001, as reported by health agencies, was 26,659, a drop of 5,192 or 16% on the comparative figure for 2000. The number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for treatment and the number of children waiting more than six months for treatment in the target specialities have both fallen by 20% in the same period. Reductions in waiting lists have been achieved across each of the eight health board regions in the period June 2000 to June 2001 with a reduction of 28% being achieved in the Midland Health Board area.</P>
      <P>Hospital waiting lists must be viewed against the background of a hospital system which discharged some 870,000 in-patients in 2000. The number of people currently on hospital in-patient waiting lists represents just 3% of all in-patient discharges in 2000. I will continue to focus on waiting lists and waiting times in order to ensure that services are available and accessible to those who most need them.</P>

      <P>My Department with the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority are currently addressing the issue of radiography staff shortages within the public health sector in the context of the provision of additional places on existing radiography courses. This has resulted in an increase of 150% &ndash; +15 places &ndash; in therapeutic radiography places in Trinity College Dublin this year and discussions are continuing regarding the provision of additional places in 2002. The expert group report on radiography grades published in July 2001 endorses this important step and reaffirms the need to assess the requirement to further increase student places.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a significant increase in the level of overseas recruitment of radiographers has taken place in recent months to address difficulties in filling current vacancies. In order to facilitate this development my Department is working to streamline the process of validation of foreign qualifications and is continuing to identify and address any impediments to successful recruitment.</P>

      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal produced a review of paediatric surgery services in 1998 which recommended the location of certain specialties and the structure of consultant paediatric surgery posts in the three Dublin paediatric hospitals. However, a disagreement at hospital level in relation to the recommendations has impacted on plans to further develop the level of surgical services for children.</P>
      <P>My Department wrote to Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Eastern Regional Health Authority in recent months with suggested minor modifications to the recommendations in relation to the structure and sessional commitment attaching to specialist paediatric surgery posts in the three hospitals. The Eastern Regional Health Authority was asked to take the necessary steps, in conjunction with the hospitals concerned, to give effect to the notifications as a matter of urgency. The authority has been in discussion with the three hospitals with a view to resolving the matter. I understand that these discussions are at an advanced stage at present and the authority expects that agreement will be reached in the near future. I am hopeful that these modifications will lead to a resolution of the present difficulty in the interest of improved service delivery and enhanced patient care. Finally, I wish to confirm that I received a letter from the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, on this matter in recent months.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the post-registration training programme which was offered to registered psychiatric nurses &ndash; RPN &ndash; and registered mental handicap nurses &ndash; RMHN &ndash; who wished to train as general nurses.</P>
      <P>More than 300 additional nursing training places have been created since 1999, in response to the current shortage of nurses. In order to provide more training places in the Dublin area where the shortages are concentrated, the school of nursing at St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, was redesignated as a pre-registration school of nursing, with an annual intake of 40 general nursing students.</P>
      <P>In view of the success of recent competitions to select nursing students for the general nursing diploma programmes and the increased number of places available on the programme this year, I do not see the need at present for a post-graduate general nursing course. It is important to bear in mind that such a course is primarily designed to cater for practising registered psychiatric and mental handicap nurses and, as such, would have the effect of withdrawing nurses from the existing workforce which would add to the difficulties hospitals and agencies in the mental health and learning disabilities section are experiencing in recruiting nurses.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, the recent tragic events in the United States have focused attention internationally on the need for enhanced co-operation between countries to counter international terrorism and its effects. In so far as the health services are concerned, the threat of terrorist incidents must now be taken into account in our emergency plans. I am advised that the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is reviewing its business continuity plan in the light of the potential threat of international terrorism. The aim of the plan is to ensure the continuity of services in the event of contamination or other serious disruptions and the threat of terrorist actions will now be factored into the plan. I understand that contingency planning will have an international dimension and that there is support among European transfusion services to extend and develop co-operation. In that regard, the IBTS is well placed to secure the support of other transfusion services in Europe and it is likely that this will lead to arrangements for emergency back-up support on a reciprocal basis. This will be facilitated by the introduction of common European standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing and processing of blood components which are being developed in anticipation of an EU directive which is expected to be completed later this year. This major initiative in blood safety in Europe will support further co-operation among member states.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the IBTS have agreed to establish a three person committee of international experts of standing in the field of blood transfusion to review the board's decision to consolidate testing. The membership of the committee will comprise a nominee of the IBTS and of the Southern Health Board and the third person to be jointly agreed. This is an important development which is being progressed.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness outlined the commitment of the Government to review bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors. A comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review has focused primarily on the emerging need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and longer terms. The review will inform the finalisation of the forthcoming health strategy.</P>
      <P>The next phase of the review will include an assessment of the regional bed requirements and related staffing needs across each health board, including the Midland Health Board area.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the article, Physical activity in Dublin children aged 7-9 years, published recently in the<i> British Journal of Sports Medicine</i>. The survey of 786 Dublin children between seven and nine years highlighted that: 14% of boys and 25% of girls in this age bracket exercised less than the minimum recommended levels necessary to benefit the cardiovascular system; irrespective of gender, 43% of the children failed to engage in even moderate levels of physical activity, such as walking and cycling and girls (28%) are about half as physically active as boys (53%) when it comes to regular vigorous exercise (at least 20 minutes of hard exercise three or more times a week).</P>
      <P>Although direct comparisons with other studies are difficult because of the different methods used, many of the findings of this study are similar to those in many other published reports, including the SLÁN survey. While the survey supports the evidence that boys are more frequent exercisers than girls, this research highlights that the difference in activity levels between the sexes, already known about teenage years, is evident from an earlier age.</P>
      <P>In response to inactivity levels among the population, this year I launched a major national media campaign, Get a Life, Get Active. The campaign message is that for health benefits we are recommended to take at least 30 minutes of moderate activity most days of the week. School children are among the key audiences as well as older people and the workplace. As well as national TV and radio advertising a settings approach at local level has been adopted in schools, workplaces and communities.</P>
      <P>This campaign is the second phase of Ireland Needs a Change of Heart and was developed in association with the Irish Heart Foundation and the health boards to address physical inactivity. National media advertising has been developed in co-operation with the Health Promotion Agency for Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The campaign included the publication of a leaflet and a 20-page publication, A Handy Guide to Physical Activity for a Healthy Heart, which provide a range of suggestions and handy hints on how to achieve better health by making physical activity an important part of daily life. These publications are widely available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses.</P>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-medical card holders and people with conditions other than those covered under the long-term illness scheme can avail of the drug payment scheme, which was introduced on 1 July 1999 and replaced the drug cost subsidisation scheme and drug refund scheme. Under the drug payment <Col N="1224" /> scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The primary aim of the drugs payments scheme is to bring about important improvements over the previous schemes and it is designed to be more streamlined, user friendly and significantly to improve the cash flow situation for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</P>
    <P>Policy in relation to eligibility for health services will be outlined in the forthcoming health strategy.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers is Inequalities in Health in Ireland &ndash; the Hard Facts, by Joe Barry <i>et alia</i>, Department of Community Health and General Practice Trinity College, Dublin. One of the main issues highlighted in the report is the link between social economic group and health status, in particular the fact that death rates for men in lower socio-economic groups such as unskilled manual workers are much higher than for men in higher professional and managerial positions. This issue has been addressed in the national health strategy, currently being finalised, and in the report of the working group on the national anti-poverty strategy and health. The implications of the report in relation to inequalities in health will be taken on <Col N="1225" /> board in the implementation of both these strategies. The report also noted that death rates seemed to be higher in medium sized towns than in larger urban areas or rural areas. The implementation of the strategy for health research launched recently and the national health information strategy now in course of development should improve our knowledge of the reasons for such variation.</P>
      <P>I have asked the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board to reply to you directly in relation to the specific local issues raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 322 and 326 together.</P>
      <P>The motorised transport grant is a meanstested payment administered by the health boards. It was introduced in 1968 by way of Circular 7/68. The guidelines were reviewed and modified in letters of 19 February 1974 and 15 March 1974. The purpose of this allowance is to provide assistance to persons with a disability who may need a car to obtain-retain employment or to provide assistance to persons with a disability who are living in very isolated circumstances and have serious transport problems.</P>
      <P>To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: their disability must impede their use of public transport; they must hold a driving licence; they must be physically and mentally capable of driving; the motorised transport must be a necessity in order for the person to obtain-retain employment or the person must have a transport requirement because of very isolated circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications may also be considered in cases where persons with severe disabilities are incapable of managing the controls of a car or where on medical opinion it is inadvisable for them to drive and therefore they must be driven to and from their place of employment. In such cases, the car must be purchased by the person with a disability and the name of the person who <Col N="1226" /> will drive this person to and from his-her place of employment must be notified to the relevant health board. The maximum motorised transport grant is currently £3,300 &ndash; 4,190.14 &ndash; with effect from 1 April 2001.</P>
    <P>Apart from the normal annual financial adjustment to the motorised transport grant, in line with social welfare increases, the only other change of any significance has been the extension of eligibility to holders of a provisional driving licence, clarified to the health boards in 1997. A national working group is currently examining the disability related allowances which come under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children and are administered by the health boards. In this context, issues relating to the motorised transport grant are being considered.</P>
    <P>I have had inquiries made of the health boards regarding the processing of applications. The health boards have advised me that although there is a procedure to be followed, that is, reports to be completed by the senior area medical officer and the community welfare officer, and information has to be provided to the board in relation to the purchase and registration of the vehicle, there does not appear to be undue delay in the processing of applications. However, if the Deputy is aware of a delay in any particular case, perhaps the information could be made available to me and I will ensure that it is investigated by the relevant health board chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question relating to the availability of the grant to people in the North-Western Health Board, I can confirm that the grant is available to eligible people in all health board areas, including the North-Western Health Board. The number of persons who received the motorised transport grant in 2000 is 296 of whom 136 were from the North-Western Health Board area.</P>

My Department is currently undertaking an examination of the disability related allowances which come under its aegis and are administered by the health boards, including mobility allowance. Any changes to the scheme proposed will be considered in the light of available resources. There are no plans to remove entitlement to the lower rate of mobility allowance from eligible people who benefit from the disabled drivers and disabled passengers &ndash; tax concessions &ndash; scheme.</P>

      <P>The nursing careers centre, which is managed by An Bord Altranais, handles arrangements for the annual intakes of students, both school leavers and mature, to the nursing diploma programmes. From this year, in line with a recommendation of the Commission on Nursing, the application system for places on those programmes is being administered by the central applications office &ndash; CAO &ndash; in close co-operation with the nursing careers centre &ndash; NCC.</P>
      <P>The NCC administered the special requirements for entry to nursing for mature code applicants. Included in the special requirements was a written assessment and a pass/fail interview. The outcome resulted in 717 applicants reaching a satisfactory standard and these were deemed qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NCC and the CAO very much regret the error which occurred during the initial offer of places to mature applicants. In round one, approximately 200 applicants who had scored lowest in the application process, were erroneously offered preferential places. The error was discovered immediately and following joint discussions between the NCC and the CAO it was decided first, to honour the offers made in error and second, to re-run the file to offer places to all those who were entitled to receive an offer. This ensured that no mature code applicant was disad<Col N="1228" /> vantaged due to the administrative error. The offer process will continue up until the 17 October 2001.</P>
    <P>My Department was informed of the error immediately it was discovered, and An Bord Altranais has kept it fully up to date on developments. An Bord Altranais has assured my Department that the decisions taken by the NCC and the CAO in the management of the error were fair and just and sought to ensure that all those who were entitled to an offer received one.</P>
    <P>The number of places available for student nurse training in 2001 is 1,559. Some 1,045 places are available in general nursing, 314 places are available in psychiatric nursing and 200 places are available in mental handicap nursing.</P>
    <P>Each year, a quota of places in each of the three diploma programmes is specifically allocated for mature applicants. The approximate quota available for mature applicants in 2001 is 156 places in general nursing, 15% &ndash; 121 places in psychiatric nursing, 35% &ndash; and 70 places in mental handicap nursing &ndash; 35% &ndash; a total of 347 places. As of the 26 September 2001, 549 mature applicants have been offered a place with 482 accepting same. In general nursing, 291 places have been accepted, 35 above the original quota, 124 places in psychiatric nursing, three places above the quota and 67 places in mental handicap nursing, three places less than the quota. As I mentioned earlier, the process of offering places to all applicants for nursing continues up to 17 October 2001 when the result of the last round of CAO offers will be known.</P>
    <P>An Bord Altranais and the admissions officers of the higher education institutions are continuing to monitor the situation closely. In the meantime, the nursing careers centre is available to provide information to any applicant who wishes to have his or her position clarified.</P>

Applications for approval in respect of a number of projects in this category that are sufficiently advanced are at present being prepared by the National Roads Authority. Applications for European Regional Development Fund aid in respect of smaller national road projects are made as expenditure is incurred. An application has been made to the EU for assistance from the trans-European transport network &ndash; TEN-T &ndash; fund towards the cost of the planning and design of parts of the N1, N7 and N8 routes.

      <P>Carraroe sewerage scheme was included as a longer-term objective &ndash; 2007-2018 &ndash; in the list of sewerage schemes submitted by Galway County Council in 1999 in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme, 2000-2002, announced in July 2000. Given the priority afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it has not been possible to include it in the programme.</P>
      <P>In a revised priority list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by the council last January, the Carraroe scheme was placed fifth on the list of sewerage schemes for the period 2002-06. The revised list will be taken into account in the context of the next phase of the water services investment programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In February 1994 local authorities were advised by my Department that full central heating should be provided in new local authority housing as part of the overall cost of the scheme. The management, maintenance and improvement of older local authority rented dwellings, including the installation of central heating, is the responsibility of local authorities to be defrayed from their own resources. Where capital funding is provided under the remedial works scheme to assist authorities to carry out major structural works to designated estates, the installation of central heating in houses may form part of the works undertaken. Local authorities may also seek approval of the use of internal capital receipts, surplus to the requirements of the local authority housing programme and remedial works scheme, for improvement works such as the provision of central heating to their dwellings. My Department is keeping the issue of central heating in local authority dwellings under review.</P>

      <P>The question of introducing a scheme whereby certain categories of dog owners could obtain a dog licence at a reduced rate has been examined. While it is recognised that a dog can provide a sense of security and companionship to many elderly people and those living alone, it is not, unfortunately, feasible to introduce such an exemption scheme without incurring substantial administrative costs and a loss of revenue to the local authorities who rely on the revenue from the sale of dog licences to finance their dog control activities.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the appropriate licensing authority, in this case Galway County Council, acting under the relevant regulations, to determine the eligibility of a person for a driving licence and to issue licences. As regards the general question of the obligation to undergo the driver theory test, my Department announced the arrangements involved in April 2001 in prospect of the commencement of the driver theory testing service on 11 June 2001. The announcement made it clear that the obligation to do the theory test would apply to anyone applying for a first provisional licence on or after 25 April 2001. For a transitional period, it was left open to new provisional licence holders to proceed if they wished, to take the practical driving test in advance of the driver theory test. It was however stipulated that a full driving licence would be granted to such persons only upon the passing of both tests. Since <Col N="1237" /> 11 June 2001, first time applicants for a provisional licence must have earlier successfully completed the theory test.</P>

      <P>The Government road safety strategy, 1998-2002, indicated that changes to speed limit regimes, which were comprehensively reviewed some years ago, were not proposed in the immediate term. The strategy indicated that a much higher level of compliance with existing speed limits should be the priority. However, the option of revising speed limits downwards is not ruled out if enforcement of existing limits does not show progress towards the strategic goal of reducing the present excessive levels of speeding. I intend that the situation will continue to be monitored in line with this approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general speed limit of 60 mph normally applies to all roads outside built up areas, with the exception of motorways. However, a local authority may apply special speed limits, such as 50 mph or 40 mph, or extend the application of the built up area speed limit, 30 mph, to any road in its functional area by making by-laws, following consultation with the Garda Commissioner and with the consent of the National Roads Authority in the case of national roads. Irrespective <Col N="1238" /> of the particular speed limit applying, there is a general obligation that a vehicle shall not be driven at a speed exceeding that which will enable its driver to bring it to a halt within the distance which the driver can see to be clear.</P>

      <P>Statutory provisions governing roadside trees and other potentially dangerous objects are contained in Section 70 of the Roads Act, 1993. These provisions oblige landowners and occupiers of land to take all necessary care to ensure that trees, shrubs, hedges on their lands are not, or could not, become a danger to road users.</P>
      <P>If a local authority considers that a hazard exists, it may serve notices on landowners and occupiers of land requiring action to be taken to remove the danger or potential danger. The local authority itself may carry out the works specified in the notice in any case where the person on whom the notice was served fails to comply with it. The authority may also carry out additional works which it considers necessary. Where there is an immediate and serious risk to road users, the local authority may act at once, without serving a notice, to remove or reduce the danger. I am satisfied that these powers, together with the general powers vested in local authorities to maintain roads, are adequate to deal with potential hazards such as mentioned in the question.</P>

      <P>The need for children to develop good road safety habits at the earliest possible age was recognised in the Government's road safety strategy. Road Accident Facts 2000, the most recent of the annual reports published by the NRA, is available in the Oireachtas Library. It indicates that of 415 people killed in road accidents in 2000, 22 were under the age of 15, representing 5.3% of the total number of road deaths. In the second progress report on the Government road safety strategy, published in July 2000, the high level group on road safety recommended that vulnerable road users, of which children form a part, be added as a further area of focus for the strategy and <Col N="1239" /> additional measures and resources be directed at this new target area.</P>
      <P>As part of its leading role in the Government strategy, the National Safety Council was asked to develop a resource pack on road safety for the social, personal, health and education programme in the new primary school curriculum. The resource pack, called Be Safe, was launched in September 2000 and over 30,000 copies of it have been distributed to primary school teachers, principals and boards of management. The NSC has also developed a secondary school transition year resource project on road safety. It has been pilot tested in 20 secondary schools throughout the country and was launched on 10 September 2001. This resource will complement existing activities in secondary schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 348 and 349 together.</P>
      <P>Current road traffic regulations require the fitting of seat belts in all forward facing front seats in all minibuses, including those used as school buses, which have a design gross vehicle weight not exceeding 3500 kg and were first registered on or after 1 January 1992. Under EU Directive 96/36/EC, member states may require that all seating positions in new passenger vehicles with seating for more than eight persons excluding the driver, are fitted with seat belts, although vehicles designed to accommodate standing passengers are excluded. The adoption of this requirement would,<i> inter alia, </i>involve the phasing out of the present 3:2 rule which applies to school buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is at present finalising a working paper on school bus safety, in consultation with the Department of Education and Science and Bus Éireann. It is intended that this paper will address the provision of seat belts in school buses. The analysis will take account of EU directives regarding the provision of seat belts in certain new buses on an optional basis, as well as further Commission proposals for an approval specification for buses in general and the mandatory use of seat belts in all vehicles in which they are fitted. The paper will also seek to clarify the benefits as well as the operational and economic <Col N="1240" /> implications of requiring seat belts to be fitted in school buses. I intend that the forthcoming paper will support a public consultation process to provide all interested parties with the opportunity to respond and assist in developing practical improvements in relation to school bus safety.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354, 355 and 368 together.</P>
      <P>An application seeking inclusion in my Department's community development programme was received from Youghal and District Community Development Group in December 1997. A similar application was also received from another community group in Youghal. As my Department was committed to expanding the community development programme under Partnership 2000, in 1998 I approved the commissioning of research to identify 30 priority areas for inclusion in the programme. To ensure that resources could be targeted at the most disadvantaged areas, it was decided to await the outcome of this research before proceeding with either application from the Youghal area. This research or pro-active targeting exercise identified Youghal as an area in need of assistance under the community development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Regional Support Agency, which is contracted by my Department to undertake the necessary pre-development work for groups or areas approved for inclusion in the community development support programmes, was engaged to begin the process of establishing a community development project in Youghal. This project was to be a broad-based community project serving <Col N="1242" /> the community development needs of Youghal rather than being made up solely of the members of either of the applicant groups.</P>
    <P>The pre-development work, which included consultations with both groups, resulted in the formation of a management committee for the CDP to be funded by my Department. This project, now known as Cumann na Daoine, has a management committee which comprises members of Youghal and District Community Development Project and other local groups and individuals in the area. The pre-development work with this group to establish a CDP in Youghal is in progress but is not yet complete. My Department is awaiting receipt of a three year workplan which I understand may be concluded by the end of the year. Funding of up to £43,100 in respect of core costs, such as staff, programme and operating costs will be made available to Cumann na Daoine in its first year of operation, once a satisfactory workplan has been received, a contract has been agreed with the project and the group have completed a recruitment process.</P>
    <P>As my Department is committed to supporting Cumann na Daoine as the community development project for Youghal, it is not possible to provide funding for an additional project in the area. My Department is, however, anxious that the pre-development work and preparation of the workplan necessary for Cumann na Daoine's full participation in the programme, be progressed, so that a contract can be issued and a worker employed at an early date. Cumann na Daoine has been advised that incidental expenses, including room hire, where appropriate, deemed necessary to conclude the pre-development phase, will be considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>My Department has contracted with a number of regional support agencies to provide support and advice for projects in the community development support programmes, CDSPs, in order to promote good practice and set standards for their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All support agencies are responsible for initial, pre-programme work in particular areas, bringing new projects and areas into the programmes and working with them in drawing up a three year workplan and negotiating their contract with my <Col N="1243" /> Department, providing ongoing advice and support for existing projects and promoting the overall development of CDSPs in the region.</P>
    <P>Prior to this year, this work was carried out on behalf of my Department by another agency in the southern region. However, over the course of last year, it became clear that the broader structure within which the support agency function was located was not conducive to the best development of the CDSP within that region. In order to address this situation, my Department agreed to a proposal from that agency that the community development support function would become a separate entity from the overall work of the agency. As managers of the CDSP, my Department considered that this proposal would ensure continuity in the support and pre-development work in the region. My Department's primary concern in this process was to ensure that adequate and acceptable arrangements for a support agency were in place as quickly and as efficiently as possible. As a result of these considerations, Teamworks Support Agency was established and was given a one year contract which will be reviewed at end of 2001 with a view to renewal in line with procedures applying to all support agencies in the programme.</P>
    <P>The support agency is currently supporting 14 established projects in the region as well as working with seven projects which are in pre-development phase. These projects are included in the following tabular statement which lists all projects currently operational or at pre-development stage in the southern region. Core funding of £265,500, 337,115.46, annually is currently paid to the Teamworks agency to cover salaries, overheads and programme costs.</P>

      <P>My Department has for a number of years operated a range of grant schemes and community development support programmes which concentrate on a wide range of supports for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs.</P>
      <P>A technical group was established by my predecessor to assist in the task of selecting new areas and assessing applications for inclusion in community development support programmes. The group's functions were to advise me on applications received from groups for funding under the community development programme, CDP, the family and community services resource centre programme, FRC, and the core funded community and family support groups programme, CFG, collectively known as the community development support programmes, CDSPs. The group also provided ongoing advice on relevant matters arising from the establishment of new CDSP projects and on the identification of new areas for future pro-active targeting exercises. The group assessed and advised on applications from existing CDSP projects for enhanced funding, as in the CDP funding framework and as may be provided for from time to time in the annual budget. It advised generally on my Department's overall package of support for community development, such as matters relating to linkage between the different schemes and support and progression routes for groups as they develop from one level to the next, but not advice on individual applications under LEVEL I and LEVEL II grant schemes.</P>
      <P>It was intended that establishment of the group would facilitate greater transparency to the selection procedures for inclusion in the community development programme and bring expertise in community development from outside the Department to bear on the process. The group's membership was drawn from, among others, departmental officials, representatives of the projects already funded under the CDSPs along with representatives from the Combat Poverty Agency and Area Development Management. The original group was appointed for a two years. When the group's term of office expired at the end of 1998 I, having considered the operation of the group and the very worthwhile input and expertise provided by members during their term, approved the renewal of the group for a further two years. As the technical group appointed at that time completed its term earlier this year, I will shortly appoint a new group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> Membership of the new group will be similar to that of the last group but will include the participation of individuals who can bring experience and expertise that reflects the current context of its operation. There will be participation from the regional assemblies and county development boards. While not a representative body, it is proposed to draw the new membership in the same proportion from the various interests in the CDSPs as applied heretofore. The terms of reference for the group, though remaining broadly the same, will also reflect the current context in which the group will operate.</P>

      <P>The telephone allowance scheme is intended primarily to provide security and social contact for those eligible, living independently in their own communities. Depending on circumstances, however, persons who move into sheltered housing accommodation may be entitled to telephone allowance, including instrument and line rental and a certain amount of calls every two months, plus the related VAT charge. The scheme does not cover the initial cost of transferring or installing a telephone line.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for the allowance depends on whether the applicant is living independently in the sheltered housing and whether they require nursing care. The allowance is not payable where such care is provided, on the basis that there is someone available to provide help in an emergency. Each application is dealt with on an individual basis and it may be necessary for a local officer of the Department to visit the relevant accommodation and assess whether the applicant concerned is eligible for the allowance in the particular circumstances.</P>

    <P>The person concerned was refused carer's allowance on 26 January 2000 on the basis that <Col N="1247" /> her means, which were derived from her spouse's income, exceeded the statutory limit. She was notified of this decision, the reason for it and of her right of appeal. Arising from further improvements made in the scheme this year, the person concerned qualifies for a carer's allowance at the weekly rate of £34.50, 43.81, with effect from 5 April 2001. It is, however, financially more beneficial to her to remain as a qualified dependant on her spouse's invalidity pension.

      <P>The 2001 budget provided for an increase of £15, 19.05, per week in respect of a qualified adult who is age 66 years or over, on old age contributory pension, retirement pension and invalidity pension. The increase was the first step in the process of increasing the qualified adult rate, QAA, to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension. The increase in the QAA rate was given in order to improve the position of women who do not qualify for a pension in their own right and is designed to complement administrative individualisation which will allow for direct payments to a qualified adult. Administrative individualisation is being examined by a working group set up under the PPF and comprises representatives of the Department, the social partners and the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>For people whose old age contributory pension, OACP, entitlement commenced on or after 6 April 2001, the rates of pension and qualified adult allowance, QAA, are as follows:</P>

      <P>Old age contributory pension is paid on the basis of contributions paid over a person's working life and blind or visually impaired people can qualify for pension on the same basis as other claimants. The pension includes increases in respect of adult and child dependants together with living alone, over 80 and fuel allowances as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Blind person's pension is a means-tested payment for people aged 18 years and over who are blind or visually impaired to such an extent that they cannot perform any work for which eyesight is essential or cannot continue in their ordinary occupation. The pension is equivalent to the rate of old age non-contributory pension. There are currently 2,182 people getting a blind person's pension from my Department, of which 589 people are over 66 and 1,593 people are under that age.</P>
      <P>All people who are resident in the State are entitled to a free travel pass from age 66. Recipients of a blind person's pension are entitled to claim a companion free travel pass. This enables the passholder and a companion age 16 or over to travel free of charge on most public, and many private, transport services throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 70 or over may claim an electricity or gas allowance, free television licence and telephone allowance. Contributory old age pensioners between ages 66 and 70 may also claim these benefits provided they reside alone or only with certain excepted categories of people. A person over age 18 who is getting a blind person's pension may claim these benefits subject to satisfying certain household composition rules.</P>
      <P>In addition to the benefits outlined above, blind or visually impaired contributory old age pensioners may qualify for additional benefits from the local health board. These would include a medical card, rent or mortgage interest allowance, exceptional needs payments and diet and heating supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>The free electricity allowance covers 1,500 units each year, 200 units per billing period in the summer and 300 units per billing period in the winter, in addition to the normal standing charges. VAT due on this standard allowance is also covered. The value of the allowance, if fully taken up, is £156.57, 198.80, per annum. Approximately 86% of recipients use their full allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the free electricity allowance <Col N="1250" /> is to provide for a basic standard of electricity usage. As it is a unit-based allowance, the recipient is protected from price increases in so far as they apply to that element of their electricity bill covered by the allowance. The Deputy's proposal to increase the number of units available under the scheme would have expenditure implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme, payment of a weekly or monthly supplement may be made in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient. The SWA scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by health boards. Neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>Rent or mortgage interest supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to the family circumstances, less £6, 7.62. This amounts to £78, 99.04, per week in the case of a single person and £132, 167.61, per week in the case of a couple, with an additional £13.20, 16.76, for each dependent child in each case.</P>
      <P>The £6, 7.62, referred to represents the minimum contribution which people are required to pay from their own resources towards their accommodation cost. In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate SWA rate. The terms of the SWA scheme also provides for a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income to be made by the health boards. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments, ENPs. Eligible people are normally in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. There is no automatic right of entitlement to such payments. ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of each individual case. The principal consideration in paying an ENP to address a particular need is that the need is of an exceptional nature. Payments should arise only under abnormal conditions and should not become a regular or standard practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> There is no provision for paying an allowance in respect of house insurance as such but ENPs have been granted in respect of house insurance costs in individual cases. Where a person feels that they may qualify for assistance by way of an ENP in respect of house insurance costs, they can make an application by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policies pursued by this Government since coming into office have been designed to maximise the supports available to low paid workers with families, including working mothers, with a view to increasing the reward for work. In this regard, enhancements to the family income supplement, FIS, scheme have included the introduction of net income assessment for the purpose of calculating FIS entitlement and progressive increases in the FIS income limits, culminating in increases of £25, 31.74, at each point from April 2001.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Government has heavily invested in the child benefit scheme as part of a strategy of making child income support more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents. This policy was intensified with the provision, in this year's budget, of a three year programme of investment in child benefit which will see the value of the payment rise almost threefold, by 2003. In addition, the tapering arrangements which apply to the qualified adult allowance have been improved, to provide for a more gradual reduction in the payment when the spouse or partner of a social welfare claimant takes up work or gets a pay increase. These reforms, together with the substantial increases in qualified adult allowances from April 2001, have improved the financial gain from employment for working mothers in welfare dependent households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding supports for lone mothers in employment who earn above the £230, 292.04, threshold for entitlement to one parent family payment, OPFP, due to the much improved income limits I have already mentioned, a person in this situation may still qualify for a payment under the family income supplement scheme. In regard to recipients of one parent family payment, OPFP, who subsequently exceed the upper earnings limit, transitional arrangements apply <Col N="1252" /> whereby 50% of the payment may be retained for a further 12 months. The £1 billion child benefit investment package I have already referred to, together with the substantial resources committed to developing child care services under the national development plan, are a measure of this Government's commitment to supporting working parents with children, including more vulnerable groups such as lone parents.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that there is no statutory limit on the length of time a caution may remain registered on a title. The only statutory requirement on the cautioner to act within a specific length of time is set out in Rule 132 of the Land Registration Rules, 1972, which provides that, once a registered owner applies to discharge a caution or a dealing of which the cautioner requires notice is presented for registration, notice shall be given to the cautioner warning him that his caution will lapse after the time stated in the notice. In practice, the time stated is usually 21 days after receipt of the notice. However, if the cautioner replies before the expiration of the notice period and makes a case for the continuation of the caution, such a case will be considered by the registrar who has the discretion to rule that the caution be continued, either indefinitely, or for a specified period, or that its entry be cancelled.</P>
      <P>I can also inform the Deputy that in order to lift a caution, an application by a registered owner for the discharge of a caution shall be furnished to the registry, in writing, stating the grounds of the application, and shall state the facts alleged in support thereof. Thereafter, the procedure outlined in the second paragraph above will apply. The Deputy may be aware that the procedure for dealing with cautions are set out in Land Registry Practice Direction No. 11, which is available from the Land Registry's offices and on the Land Registry's website, www.landregistry.ie.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, capital grant schemes for self-employed and private providers of child care are part of the Government child care funding initiatives administered under my Department's equal opportunities child care programme, 2000-06. In March 2001, I approved a grant of £12,424 (15,775), to the applicant in question, under my Department's capital grant for self-employed child care providers scheme. This funding was allocated towards the cost of purchasing equipment for the child care service. The applicant had also sought funding for building work which had been carried out prior to September 2000. As the building work had been carried out prior to the application for funding in mid-December 2000, the costs involved were not eligible for funding. As the Deputy may be aware, funding under the equal opportunities childcare programme is EU co-financed and under EU rules, retrospective funding is not allowable. In April 2001, a revised application was received in my Department's equal opportunities child care section. I understand that additional funding was sought towards the costs of tarring (surfacing) the entrance and surrounding area of the creche. Following an assessment by Area Development Management Ltd., this application was then considered by the programme appraisal committee.</P>
      <P>The committee noted, in their consideration of this revised application, that the recommendations in the applicant's health board report did not require the tarring and surfacing work for which funding was now being sought. Furthermore, the programme appraisal committee were of the view that as the property was rented on a short lease the benefit of the work under consideration would accrue to the landlord of the property more than the child care service. As a consequence, the programme appraisal committee did not recommend the request for additional funding. I understand that, as the applicant has not reached the £40,000 (50,789.52) maximum for a capital grant for a private child care facility, a further application in respect of future expenditure could be considered within the existing guidelines of the equal opportunities child care programme. With regard to the funding already approved, I understand from ADM Ltd., who administer the funding on behalf of my Department, that to date £9,318 (11,831) of the amount awarded has been drawn down by the grant recipient.</P>

      <P>I can inform the Deputy that discussions between my Department and Dublin Corporation in relation to the provision of modern office and laboratory facilities for the State Pathology Service, in conjunction with the Dublin City Coroner's office, are at an advanced stage. I understand that Dublin Corporation, which is overseeing the project, has arranged for the preparation of detailed drawings of the proposed accommodation. It is expected that the project will take approximately two years to complete. In the meantime, my Department is considering alternative accommodation arrangements for the State Pathology Service.</P>

      <P>Fireworks are deemed to be explosives under the Explosives Act, 1875 and, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, they may only be imported under an important licence granted by my Department. It is a long standing policy that such licences are granted only for the purposes of organised displays conducted by professional and knowledgeable operators. My Department, however, is currently reviewing the legislation relating to explosives, including fireworks. Despite the restrictive policy, fireworks <Col N="1258" /> are imported illegally especially leading up to and around Hallowe'en. While the Garda is constantly vigilant in the enforcement of legislative provisions relating to the illegal importation and sale of fireworks, the Garda Commissioner has informed me that specific Garda operations will be mounted approaching and during the Hallowe'en period to prevent and detect these offences. While details of these operations cannot be disclosed for obvious reasons, similar previous operations have resulted in criminal prosecutions and the seizure of very substantial quantities of fireworks. As in previous years, these measures will also include liaising with other services and a public awareness media publicity campaign aimed at parents and children regarding the dangers of handling fireworks.</P>

I no longer have direct responsibility for such matters. However, I can inform the Deputy that statistics relating to custody matters for the year 2000 are included in the annual report of the Courts Service which is available in the Oireachtas Library. Furthermore, I understand from the Courts Service that statistics for previous years are available on request. Family law is kept under review in my Department and I will be happy to consider any suggestions which the Deputy has to make.</P>

    <P>Recorded and detected crime statistics for each Garda region in 1999 are provided in the annual report of the Garda Síochána for that year, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. <Col N="1260" /> Due to the replacement of the Garda Síochána's crime reporting computer system at the end of September 1999, statistics for crime in each Garda region for that year relate to the nine-month period January to September. The full-year figure for total recorded indictable crime across all Garda regions for 1999 was 81,274, of which 42 per cent were detected. Statistics for the year 2000 are currently being compiled and will be available in due course.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the waiting times for the processing of land registry dealings is as set out in the following tabular statement. As the Deputy will appreciate the length of time taken to complete cases varies depending on a number of factors, including the complexity of the case and the completeness of the documentation forwarded by the solicitors. The volume of business being transacted at any stage would also have a bearing on matters. The Deputy may also wish to note that any cases involving urgency are, in accordance with the customer service policy of the Land Registry, dealt with expeditiously.</P>

    <P>I can inform the Deputy that the ITRIS, integrated title registration information system, is now operational in nine counties which represent <Col N="1263" /> over 60% of all dealings lodged. The ITRIS will be extended to all counties by the end of 2002. I also point out to the Deputy that the statistics provided in the first column of the tabular statement, &ldquo;not requiring subdivision/creation of a new title&rdquo;, represent almost 70% of the total intake of cases by the Land Registry.</P>

    <P>*The figures shown for Kildare, Wicklow and Cork represent the time frame for any case lodged since the roll out of ITRIS. I have been informed by the Land Registry that pre-ITRIS cases in these areas are taking approximately 22 months to complete in Kildare and Wicklow and 14 months in Cork. As the Deputy will be aware, arising out of the increased activity in the property market, the intake of applications in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds has grown to an unprecedented level with each successive year setting new record levels. From current figures available, it appears that the intake of applications for 2001 will be approximately 160,000. The tabular statement below sets out the intake and output in the registries since 1993.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will be aware that last year, in order to address the increasing intake of applications, I received sanction from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to increase the staffing complement of the Land Registry by 77. Most of these appointments were made during the past year <Col N="1264" /> and the training of the new staff is now beginning to pay dividends. Already this year, to the end of September, over 112,000 dealings have been completed representing an increase in output for the same period of almost 47% over year 2000.</P>
    <P>I also inform the Deputy that I have recently received sanction for a further 19 temporary posts and a recruitment drive is now under way. I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made by the management and staff of the Land Registry to address the problems which have developed over a period of time, mainly due to the unprecedented increase in the levels of business. The Land Registry management is implementing some proactive measures to help deal with the situation, including improvements to workflow, the training and development of staff, the use of new technology, the launch of an e-commerce service and the computerised data capture of folios and maps. I am confident that, with the appointment of additional staff and the programme of measures being taken, the situation will continue to improve.</P>

      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, (Age Card) Regulations, 1999, provide for a <Col N="1265" /> voluntary national age card scheme whereby any person who has attained 18 years of age may apply for an age card at his or her local Garda Station in order to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor. The Garda community relations section in Harcourt Square has been given responsibility under the regulations for the issuing of the cards and I am informed by the Garda authorities that the total number of cards issued up to 5 October 2001 is 41,699. I am also informed that, due to a temporary difficulty with the Garda database for the cards, a breakdown of the number of age cards issued by county is only possible for the period up to 13 September 2001. A total of 35,976 cards were issued up to this date. I am assured by the Garda authorities that the difficulty with the database will be rectified in the next few days and I will forward the up to date figures to the Deputy at this stage. In the interim, the following table shows the number of age cards issued by county up to 13 September 2001.</P>

Due to the replacement of the Garda Síochána's crime reporting computer system at the end of September 1999, statistics by Garda division for that year relate to the nine month period January to September, although the full year figure for the entire country is provided. Garda statistics for the year 2000 are currently being compiled and will be available in due course. Statistics in respect of the current year will be included in the Garda Síochána's Annual Report 2001, which will be published during 2002. As crime statistics are prepared by the Garda Síochána according to its organisational structure and associated divisional boundaries, it is not possible to break down these statistics according to postal district or location.</P>

      <P>The Premier of the People's Republic of China visited Ireland from 2-5 September 2001 and resided at Farmleigh Estate from 2-4 September 2001. I am informed by the Garda authorities &ndash; who are responsible for the detailed allocation and resources to individual areas &ndash; that the policing operation in respect of the DMA West division, where Farmleigh Estate is situated, came into place at 18.00 hours on 31 <Col N="1270" /> August 2001 and concluded at 12.00 hours on 4 September 2001. The total cost of the operation at Farmleigh Estate is not yet available but I will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as it is.</P>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner is not in favour, for operational reasons, of releasing details of the number of Garda personnel and units that are involved in security operations of this nature and I am in agreement with this. I am, however, informed that Garda personnel from the DMA West division who were involved in the operation were sourced from specially employed units in the division, thus allowing regular units perform at usual strength. To this end, I am also advised by the Garda authorities that the visit did not impact on the regular policing units and that station strengths were not depleted for the duration of the visit.</P>

    <P>All fatal road traffic accidents are investigated by the Garda. A file is prepared and sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions for directions as to the appropriate charges, if any, in each case where there is a surviving driver. In relation to alleviating the causes of fatal accidents, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 117 of 3 October 2001 concerning the response to road deaths by all the agencies involved in road safety.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Government's National Strategy on Road Safety, 1998-2002, which contains a package of measures encompassing new legislation, enhanced enforcement, road improvement works and improvements to the driver education system. In July 2001 the inter-agency high level group on road safety published the third progress <Col N="1271" /> report on the implementation of the national strategy. This report highlights the action items on improving road safety which have been implemented or are in the process of implementation, including those action items which have to be implemented by the end of 2002.</P>

      <P>The funding for the Garda Síochána is provided on a national basis through Vote 20 which is divided into a number of subheads dealing with various cost items. Although work is under way to implement the devolution of budgets within the Garda, it is not possible at this time to identify the funding for operational units in isolation. I am, however, satisfied that my Department has put in place the necessary resources to enable the gardaí to carry out their duties with respect to traffic.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that there is a total of 457 members attached to traffic units in Garda divisions throughout the country. These members are employed on full-time traffic duties. In addition to these members, all members employed on uniform duties are also involved in the enforcement of road traffic legislation and regulations. There are currently six mobile speed detection units, that is, GATSOs, in operation throughout the State and approval has been given for the purchase of a seventh. In addition to these units, the gardaí use up to date speed detection equipment such as laser speed detection devices, radar speed detection devices and Lastec in car video systems. They also have access to alcometers and evidential breath testing machines, supplied by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.</P>
      <P>The question of fixed cameras &ndash; including future funding &ndash; is being addressed. A pilot programme using four fixed cameras, rotated around 20 sites in Louth-Meath, is under way. The pilot programme and the future policy regarding fixed cameras is currently being examined by a sub-committee of the inter-agency high level group on road safety. This sub-committee, which includes representatives of my Department, the Garda Síochána and the National Roads Authority, is developing policy in relation to siting and other operational issues concerning fixed cameras. A total of 34 extra motorcycles were added to the Garda fleet last year to enhance traffic management and enforcement of road traffic legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's National Strategy on Road Safety, 1998-2002, contains commitments to <Col N="1272" /> enhance Garda enforcement capability. I refer the Deputy to the third progress report of the high level group on road safety on the implementation of the national strategy, published in July 2001. The report includes details of action items implemented as well as items to be implemented by my Department and the Garda Síochána. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the effectiveness of the enforcement of road traffic legislation is reviewed on a continuous basis and in this regard a number of measures have been taken. The Garda National Traffic Bureau under the direction of a chief superintendent was established in July 1997. The primary focus of the bureau is policy development, with particular emphasis on formulating proactive enforcement strategies aimed at reducing road deaths and road accidents.</P>
    <P>Operation Lifesaver was launched on 14 July 1997 in the Louth/Meath Garda division and has now been extended to all divisions. The operation involves high levels of patrolling, checkpoints and speed checks, in addition to an extensive road safety publicity campaign which involves media campaigns, using national and local radio stations and schools programmes which are designed to educate all road users on the need to take care on our roads.</P>
    <P>The fines-on-the-spot system was extended to speeding offences in 1997. In 1999, a total of 170,000 fines-on-the-spot were issued for speeding. The fine-on-the-spot system was extended to cover other offences such as breaking traffic lights, failing to stop at a stop sign and non-wearing of seat belts in 1999. The three target safety offences are excessive speed, driving while intoxicated and non-wearing of seat belts. There has been a steady increase in the enforcement and detection of these offences.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the Government's National Strategy on Road Safety, 1998-2002, Operation Lifesaver &ndash; which has run as a national operation since 1997 &ndash; will remain the principal operation during the current year. The consideration by the Garda of tenders for a new fines-on-the-spot processing system is at an advanced stage. This system, which will replace the interim fines-on-the-spot system, will process all offences with an on-the-spot/fixed charge penalty and enable the introduction of the penalty points legislation following enactment of the Road Traffic Bill.</P>
    <P>The situation is being kept under review and any new measures considered necessary will be put in place.</P>

      <P>The initiative to encourage the use of a designated driver is one of the many initiatives introduced by the Garda with a view to improving road safety. I welcome any initiative designed to improving our overall road safety record.</P>
      <P>Drink driving is one of the principal offences, along with speeding, seat belt offences and dangerous/careless driving, identified as a cause of road deaths. All the agencies involved in road safety, in particular, the National Safety Council, promote anti-drink driving campaigns. In this regard, the designated driver campaign over the August weekend is an example of such initiatives. The Garda are hopeful that such initiatives will make a positive contribution to road safety. I refer to the Government's National Strategy on Road Safety, 1998-2002, which contains a package of measures encompassing new legislation, enhanced enforcement, road improvement works and improvements to the driver education system.</P>
      <P>In July 2001 the inter-agency High Level Group on Road Safety published the third progress report on the implementation of the national strategy. This report highlights the action items on improving road safety which have been implemented or are in the process of implementation, including those action items which have to be implemented by the end of 2002. Improved driver education, including initiatives such as the designated driver initiative is an important element of the national strategy. It is difficult to quantify precisely the effect of the designated driver initiative. However, all initiatives designed to promote road safety are to be welcomed.</P>

      <P>Details in relation to all road accidents, reported to the gardaí, are supplied by the gardaí to the National Roads Authority. A detailed report on road accidents entitled Road Accident Facts, Ireland, is prepared and published by the authority. The latest published report is in respect of 1999. Information in relation to the number of fatal accidents that occurred in each Garda division within the times referred to by the Deputy are not readily available. It would require a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources to compile such information. However, details in relation to the number of fatal accidents nationally that occurred between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. are published in the National Roads Authority report on accidents referred to above.</P>

      <P>While the Garda Síochána tows away vehicles in circumstances such as those set out below, the primary responsibility for towing illegally parked vehicles rests with the Office of the Director of Traffic, Dublin Corporation, and questions in relation to any vehicles towed by the corporation's employees or agents are a matter for the corporation to address. I am informed by the Garda authorities that motor vehicles towed away on the occasion of major all-Ireland hurling and football matches are removed mainly for illegal parking. Primarily, the vehicles involved are parked dangerously at or on junctions, causing obstruction, blocking entrances resulting in restricted access for emergency vehicles or parked on footpaths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the majority of vehicles towed are parked in the residential areas adjacent to Croke Park and are mainly the subject of complaint from residents to gardaí. Vehicles towed by gardaí are taken to the Garda pound at Infirmary Road. Vehicles towed by Control Plus on behalf of Dublin Corporation are taken to the Control Plus pound at New Wapping Street. The fee for the release of vehicles from either pound is £130. This fee is set by regulation made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who is responsible for all road traffic and parking legislation, including the regulations made thereunder. I am also informed by the Garda authorities that five vehicles in total with Galway registration plates were towed by the Garda on the dates in question, broken down as follows:<Col N="1277" /></P>

It should be borne in mind that the research on which the concept of a national conference centre was based was almost ten years old. The consultants have now presented their report entitled Maximising Ireland's Potential in the International Conference Market to Bord Fáilte. My Department is awaiting Bord Fáilte's response to the report and its recommendations before completing its examination of the report and when this process is complete I will be reporting to Government on the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed by school authorities in relation to increased insurance costs and related conditions referred to by the Deputy. At primary level, schools' running costs have been traditionally met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants and the local <Col N="1279" /> contribution. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of primary schools, including insurance costs. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since the Government took office in 1997. It has been increased from £45 per pupil in 1997 to £75.50 per pupil in this school year. In addition a rate of £80 per pupil will apply in the 2001-2002 school year. This constitutes an increase of 77% over that period.</P>
      <P>Children attending special schools and special classes attached to ordinary schools attract a special increased rate of capitation funding. For example, the special capitation rate applicable to children with a mild general learning disability is £278.50 for children under 12 years and £438.50 for older children. Children with autism attract a rate of £451.50. My Department allocates supplementary funding in disadvantaged schools at primary level through a number of measures. These include the disadvantaged areas scheme, the Breaking the Cycle pilot project and the new programme, Giving Children an Even Break. In the case of schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme, an extra £30 is paid per pupil in the form of capitation grants which covers heating and general running costs, equipment and materials and a home/school/community liaison grant for activities with parents. Schools in this scheme also qualify for a yearly refund of their television licence fee and a 95% grant for building projects. Pupils attending schools in the Breaking the Cycle scheme also attract the £30 supplementary capitation funding that is paid to schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme. Additional grants are also allocated in respect of materials and equipment. All the schools that are participating in the new disadvantage programme, Giving Children an Even Break, receive a special supplementary grant based on the levels of disadvantaged pupils in the schools, with a minimum payment of £750 to each school. Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme or Breaking the Cycle will retain their entitlements under those schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of secondary schools, it is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange insurance cover on school property and against public liability. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs provided by my Department by way of <i>per capita </i>grants may be used for this purpose. Recent developments at second level include significant improvements in the level of the standard capitation grant. In 1999, the <i>per capita</i> grant was increased to £184 from £177. I further increased the grant by £8 from September last year to £192 and by £10 from September this year, bringing the standard<i> per capita</i> grant over £200 for the first time. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional<i> per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bring<Col N="1280" /> ing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have also established the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year. My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and I intend to build further on progress to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy school bags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and in particular:  (i) the extent of the problem; (ii) the factors which contribute to the problem; and (iii) possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils.</P>
      <P>The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998. The report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers. I have asked my officials to forward a copy of the report to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The report acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level and one of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags. In this regard my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. Information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its individual needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also recommended that my Department should examine the feasibility of providing for appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers. Accordingly, the building unit of my Department is examining <Col N="1281" /> the possibility of incorporating storage facilities in the provision of furniture in the future. In relation to second level schools, my Department continues to afford schools the option of book storage in the case of new schools in line with the report's recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has placed a high priority on increasing funding to schools. In recent years I have provided significant increases in existing funding and have also introduced new funding arrangements in some areas. The quality of the primary and second level infrastructure has been significantly improved over the past four years through a programme of sustained capital investment. At the end of 2000, £81 million has been expended on capital projects at primary level and £112 million has been expended at second level on school capital projects. For the current year I have provided at primary and second level an unprecedented £93 million and £129 million respectively for investment in school infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Recent developments at primary level include significant improvements in the level of the standard capitation grant. I increased the rate of the capitation grant for primary schools from the £45 per pupil that applied in 1997 to £75.50 last September, and a rate of £80 will apply from September this year. This constitutes an increase of some 77% over that period.</P>
      <P>Children attending special schools and special classes attached to ordinary schools attract a special increased rate of capitation funding. For example, the special capitation rate applicable to children with a mild general learning disability is £278.50 for children under 12 years and £438.50 for older children. Children with autism attract a rate of £451.50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department allocates supplementary funding in disadvantaged schools at primary level through a number of measures. These include the disadvantaged areas scheme, the Breaking the Cycle pilot project and the new programme &ndash; Giving Children an Even Break. In the case of schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme, an extra £30 is paid per pupil in the form of capitation grants, which covers heating and general running costs, equipment and materials and a home-school-community liaison grant for activities with parents. Schools in this scheme also qualify for a yearly refund of their television licence fee and a 95% grant for building projects. Pupils attending schools in the Breaking the Cycle scheme also attract the £30 supplementary <Col N="1282" /> capitation funding that is paid to schools in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <P>Additional grants are also allocated in respect of materials and equipment. Almost 2,300 primary schools will receive supplementary grants for the next three years under the major new disadvantage programme, Giving Children an Even Break, based on the levels of disadvantaged pupils in the schools, at the rate of £50 per disadvantaged pupil, with a minimum payment of £750 to each school. Schools already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme or Breaking the Cycle will retain their entitlements under those schemes.</P>
    <P>My Department operates a devolved grant scheme to enable minor works to be carried out to national school properties. Payment is made every school year at a rate of £3,000 per school plus £10 per pupil. The scheme is intended to cover minor improvements to school buildings and grounds, replacement of mechanical and electrical services, the purchase of furniture and the provision of floor coverings and blinds. If there are no outstanding works to be undertaken at the school under these headings, the school authorities may expend the grant on items of equipment such as computers, overhead projectors and photocopiers. Subject to compliance with the terms of the scheme, expenditure of the grant is entirely at the discretion of the school authorities.</P>
    <P>Over the past three years, my Department has also provided grant assistance to schools to meet their running costs by means other than the capitation grant or the minor works grant. For instance, in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking assistance to schools, I increased the rates of grant towards secretarial and caretaking services by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum, which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    <P>These improvements mean that for the first time all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was some £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to some £12.2 million and will further increase substantially this year.</P>
    <P>In 1999, I introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools. Under the terms of this grant all schools designated as disadvantaged plus schools in the rural phase of the Breaking the Cycle scheme will receive an annual grant of £1,000 per school while all other schools will receive £500 per school.</P>
    <P>Under my Department's IT2000 programme, grants in excess of £13.1 million have been paid, since 1998, in respect of the educational IT equip<Col N="1283" /> ment and software needs of ordinary national schools, special schools and special needs classes.</P>
    <P>In addition to the commitments outlined above, my Department has also issued a number of other grants to schools over the past three years to assist them with the purchase of various resources. These grants include a library grant in December 1998, a science grant and an infants grant in October 1999, a national reading initiative grant in December 1999, a visual arts grant in November 2000 and a curriculum &ndash; arts &ndash; grant in November 2000. The total value of these grants amounts to approximately £19.5 million.</P>
    <P>At primary level, in addition to the funding improvements outlined above, substantial progress has been made in providing additional supports to schools. The measures introduced to date include: the introduction of the scheme of release time for teaching principals with paid substitution cover for the 2000/2001 school year; the appointment of administrative principals to ordinary schools with an enrolment of 180 pupils and Gaelscoileanna with an enrolment of 158 pupils on 30 September 2000 in the 2001-02 school year; and the appointment of administrative principals to ordinary schools where there are ten or more teachers including <i>ex quota</i> posts.</P>
    <P>At second level, the <i>per capita</i> grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. I further increased the grant by £8 from September last year to £192 and by £10 from September this year, bringing the standard <i>per capita</i> grant over £200 for the first time. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have introduced the school services support fund. This is a new initiative under which schools now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. I have also provided for an increase in the grant scheme for school books for needy pupils in post-primary schools to some £4.7 million for year 2001. This represents an increase of almost 20% on the amount provided in 1996. </P>
    <P>Furthermore, students whose parents hold medical cards have been exempted from the payment of entry fees for the certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>Schools have also benefited under the IT initiative. Since 1998, £41 million will have been allocated to second-level schools under the initiative towards educational ICT infrastructural development and software needs of schools. All schools are eligible for recurrent grants towards special classes &ndash; £158 per pupil &ndash; and curricular support grants, namely transition year &ndash; £50, leaving certificate applied &ndash; £125, physics and <Col N="1284" /> chemistry &ndash; £10, and introductory grant for the junior certificate schools programme &ndash; £50. Other grants have also issued to schools over the past three years to assist them with the purchase of various resources. Grants amounting, in total, to £5 million were channelled to schools under the library and national reading initiative. Under the science initiative, in addition to the <i>per capita </i>grant of £10 introduced in 1999, grants of £10,500 per school at a cost of approximately £7 million were paid in 2000 towards the cost of science equipment.</P>
    <P>Arising from the PCW agreement on teachers' pay and conditions, middle management in second level schools has been improved through the creation of significant numbers of additional posts of responsibility. In addition, over the past two years, in excess of 1,200 new teaching posts have been created at second level. Schools have welcomed these improvements. It is my intention to improve further the financial position of primary and second level schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits. </P>

      <P>In practice, the categories listed above are entitled to free access to PLC courses, while all other categories are required to pay the economic fee of £2,877 per annum.

Participants who pay the economic fee must be self-supporting, and have approval to remain in the State, that is  approval letter from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, student visa or green handbook stamped by gardaí.</P>
      <P>Asylum seekers who entered the country after 26 July 1999 are not eligible for free PLC tuition, except in cases where they have been granted &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; or on the basis of being the parents of an Irish born child.</P>

In addition, a pilot initiative in the Dublin area has been put in place to test models of good practice in this area, to initiate pilot actions and make recommendations on a framework for future delivery. A report will be available from the project early next year.

In that case, the applicants were unable to identify suitable temporary accommodation to allow the school to commence operations in the current school year and, accordingly, recognition could not be granted.

      <P>My Department is not aware of the case referred to by the Deputy. Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools and my Department does not interfere in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. The National Educational Psychological Service, or NEPS, is available to all post-primary schools <Col N="1289" /> recognised by my Department. NEPS can advise on the management of any difficulties which pupils might experience and which may present problems in a school setting. Where appropriate it can also advise on any educational supports which might be required to ensure that a pupil's time in school is as productive and positive as possible.</P>
      <P>In order to progress the case referred to by the Deputy, my Department has issued a questionnaire to the child's parents which will help identify his educational needs and provide my Department with their written permission to contact schools and the NEPS on behalf of their child.</P>

      <P>There is a range of programmes in place to address educational disadvantage at both primary and second levels. In relation to primary, earlier this year, I launched the new programme &ndash; Giving Children an Even Break &ndash; which will cost £26 million over a three year period. Other initiatives include the early start pilot project, Breaking the Cycle pilot project in primary schools, the home-school-community liaison scheme and the 8-15 early school leaver Initiative which cover both levels, the stay in school retention initiative at second level, and learning and support teacher projects. There is also a number of non-mainstream initiatives which are targeted at meeting the special needs of young people who have either become involved in minor delinquency or are at risk of becoming involved in delinquency and have become alienated from mainstream schools.</P>
      <P>Each of the interventions outlined is monitored by my Department's inspectorate to ensure that they are addressing the needs of the educationally disadvantaged pupils being targeted and where modifications in programme content or mode of delivery are required, the necessary changes are made to incorporate these. Some of the initiatives have also been externally evaluated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that all programmes funded by my Department are subject to external review by independent experts in order to ascertain whether the programme objectives are being achieved and the needs of the target group are being catered for in an effective manner. For this reason, the new programme has a built in exter<Col N="1290" /> nal evaluation and review mechanism. I have also made arrangements to have all major initiatives in the area of educational disadvantage externally evaluated by independent experts. The Education Research Centre has been engaged to undertake the first of these reviews in relation to the home/school/community liaison scheme. It is expected that this review will be completed early next year. In this rolling programme of external reviews, it is planned that the following programmes will be evaluated: the early school leaver initiative for those between the ages of eight and 15 &ndash; phase II; the &ldquo;stay-in-school&rdquo; retention initiative; the fund for development of targeted educational responses to certain children at risk; the support teachers project; the new programme to tackle disadvantage at primary level; the early start pre-school project and special education projects, schemes and initiatives.</P>
    <P>The ongoing work of my Department's inspectorate together with the programme of independent review will ensure that services for educationally disadvantaged children are provided in a co-ordinated and effective manner.</P>

The On My Own Two Feet programme, which provides similar material at secondary level, was availed of by 22 second level school, out of a total of 27 such schools in County Kildare.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. While these posts are fully funded by my Department, the secretaries and caretakers involved are employees of the individual school authorities. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.</P>
      <P>The schools referred to by the Deputy share the services of a full-time secretary under the 1978-79 scheme. However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my officials will be writing to both schools shortly outlining proposals to allocate the post in its entirety to one of the schools concerned. The other school will then become eligible for additional funding under a more extensive grant scheme that was introduced in the PESP Agreement in 1992.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Both schools have already been included in this scheme for caretaking support.</P>
      <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These improvements mean that, for the first time, all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approxi<Col N="1294" /> mately £12.2 million and will further increase substantially this year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school based community employment schemes come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to make significant progress in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post primary levels are now almost finalised and I expect to be in a position to launch them within the next week. My Department is arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and post primary schools. These circulars which will be available shortly will outline details of the new funding arrangements.</P>

      <P>The student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing certain full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years' duration in another EU member state as and from the 1996-97 academic year. The extension of the <Col N="1295" /> schemes at that time did not include courses at postgraduate level and, accordingly, there is no grant aid available from my Department for students pursuing postgraduate studies outside Ireland, irrespective of whether a particular course is available in Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to extend the current arrangements to provide for students pursuing postgraduate courses outside Ireland. However, the Deputy may be aware that section 21 of the Finance Act, 2000, as amended by section 29 of the Finance Act, 2001, provides for the introduction of tax relief for post-graduate tuition fees paid in colleges outside of Ireland. This relief, which is available from the tax year 2000-01 onwards, will apply at the standard rate of tax. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The educational needs of primary pupils with specific learning disability are generally capable of being met in mainstream schools with the assistance, where appropriate, of the learning support teacher service. There are currently 1,485 learning support teachers in place in primary schools. Where the condition is of a more serious nature, support can be provided by the special resource teacher service. The number of resource teachers operating in primary schools on a full or part-time basis has increased from 104 in October 1998 to approximately 1,000 at present.</P>
      <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into mainstream classes. In such situations they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teacher. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations. In December 2000 I announced a highly innovative nationwide pilot scheme to assist second level students with dyslexia and other reading difficulties. Around the country 31 schools are participating in the pilot project costing £2 million. Each student with dyslexia has been provided with a laptop computer for school and home use. My Department is also continuing to support the work carried out by the Dyslexia Association of Ireland in assisting people with dyslexia. An allocation of £96,000 has been made to the association in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the delivery of therapeutic support services for children with dyslexia is a matter for the relevant health authority. In October 2000 I established a special task force on dyslexia to examine the adequacy of my Depart<Col N="1296" /> ment's current responses in this area and to make recommendations on the future development of services for children with dyslexia. I understand the task force has now completed its detailed deliberations and I expect to receive its report before the end of this month. I understand the issue raised by the Deputy will be among the matters addressed by the task force.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate that there has been a massive and unprecedented increase in the funds allocated by this Government to the schools building programme at all levels. There are more than 850 major school building projects at various stages of planning. Decisions relating to the rate of progress to construction of these projects, including the school referred to by the Deputy, will be taken in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes in 2002 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have recently secured the transfer of £46 million per annum to my Department on a phased basis between now and 2003, as the FÁS school based community employment schemes, CE, come to an end. The availability of this funding will enable me to make significant progress on the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools by putting in place an equitable system of funding for ancillary services throughout the free education school system. My Department will receive a total of £32 million in this school year.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the distribution of the moneys received this year at primary and post-primary levels are now almost finalised and I expect to be in a position to announce them within the next week. My Department is arranging for circulars to issue to all primary and second level schools. These circulars, which will be available shortly, will outline details of the new funding arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS that all school based CE participants with a legitimate expectation of up to three years' participation in a school based CE scheme will be facilitated to complete their full term. This adjustment to the phasing out of CE schemes in schools means that certain CE participants may be entitled to continue working on CE in schools up to and including 2004 depending on their individual circumstances and entitlements under CE. This adjustment should also ensure that the withdrawal of CE schemes takes place on a more gradual basis and, therefore, reduce the immediate impact on schools.</P>

      <P>Every effort is made by my Department to ensure that the results of rechecks are made available as quickly as possible to candidates. In recent years, in the interests of openness and transparency, I have arranged for candidates to have access to their marked examination scripts. As a result, candidates are in a position to inform themselves regarding the accuracy of the marking and, in the light of this, make an informed decision regarding the need to appeal. To provide time for this very worthwhile and innovative development, the closing date for appeal applications in 2001 was Wednesday, 5 September. The appeal process involves a full remarking of the candidate's work and it is necessary to provide examiners with adequate time to engage in that task. My Department issued the outcome of appeals to schools and the central applications office on 4 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the desirability of the earliest possible notification of the outcome of the appeals process for candidates. My Department will con<Col N="1301" /> tinue to work to ensure that the outcome of appeals is available at the earliest possible date having regard to the clear desirability of providing candidates with an opportunity to view their scripts and the requirements of the remarking process itself.</P>

The level of non-EU places does not impact in any manner on the intake of Irish-EU students to undergraduate medical courses. This intake is the subject of a quota, which was introduced in 1980-81 following a report of the Higher Education Authority. The question of reviewing the current quota arrangements is currently being considered by my Department in consultation with the Department of Health and Children.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, which is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question was 42 pupils on 30 September 1999 and remained unchanged as at 30 September 2000. This enrolment entitles the school to a staffing of a principal and one mainstream class teacher for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the school has a learning support teacher, who is based in the school, and a shared resource teacher. The only deviation from the agreed schedule to which I referred is in the case of schools that have experienced a large increase in enrolments. Unfortunately, at this time, the school's increased enrolment does not meet the defined criteria and it is therefore not possible to sanction the appointment of a third mainstream teaching post for the school year 2001-02.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to determine the precise number of special needs assistants which may <Col N="1303" /> ultimately be appointed nationwide or in the specific areas mentioned by the Deputy. All children with special needs within the primary sector now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs. The response in question may take the form of resource teacher support or special needs assistant support, or both, depending on the particular need involved. All such allocations are made on the basis of the professionally assessed needs of each individual child.</P>
      <P>Already, as a result of the Government's decision, the number of full or part-time special needs assistants supporting children with special needs in primary schools has been increased from less than 300 to approximately 2,500. This includes a total of 43 special needs assistants in County Sligo and 12 in County Leitrim. Additional special needs assistant support will continue to be allocated as long as there are special needs which require such a response.</P>
      <P>My Department allocates special needs assistant posts to ordinary second level schools to cater for the needs of special needs pupils. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each case is considered on its merits and determined on the advice of the psychological service.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, special needs assistant posts have been allocated to two second level schools in County Sligo and to two in County Leitrim. The posts are temporary in nature. However, they will continue to be allocated by my Department as long as the need for the posts exists.</P>

      <P>The development of the vocational training opportunities scheme &ndash; VTOS &ndash; features strongly in the back to education initiative, as set out in the White Paper on Adult Education Learning for Life. Under this measure, £1.27 <Col N="1304" /> billion is being provided under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, which proposes the development of a number of programmes, including the vocational training opportunities scheme &ndash; VTOS &ndash; on a part-time basis. One of the principal objectives of the vocational training opportunities scheme is to reach those most in need, particularly older unemployed people and those with the lowest educational skills.</P>
      <P>The structure of, and entry criteria to, VTOS are under consideration in the context of a consultancy study currently being undertaken with a view to making the scheme even more effective in targeting people who are hardest to reach.

      <P>The student to whom the Deputy refers is in receipt of a higher education grant under the scheme administered on behalf of my Department by the local authorities. My Department understands that the student was assessed by Kerry County Council for the purpose of the special rates of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged students, recently introduced by my Department. He was, however, found to be ineligible, as reckonable income did not include income from one of the social welfare payments or designated programmes, which must be held, in order to establish eligibility for a special rate of maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>

      <P>Last January I launched a major new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The new programme will be run over a three year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the new programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil-teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash; and a pupil-teacher ratio of 29:1 in senior classes &ndash; third through sixth classes.</P>
      <P>The school in question has been included in the urban dimension and has received supplementary grant aid of £8,070 in respect of the 2000-01 school year towards providing additional educational supports for the pupils concerned. The school will also receive additional funding during the current school year. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the schools as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome.</P>
      <P>Where schools expressed concern about the outcome of the survey in respect of their school, they were advised to make representations to my Department outlining their circumstances. Schools were informed that these representations would then be referred to the Educational Research Centre for consideration and my Department would then consider the position of these schools.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the approach outlined,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>representations from the school in question were forwarded to the Educational Research Centre. My Department has now received a report from <Col N="1306" /> the Educational Research Centre and the situation of this school and other such schools is currently under consideration. The school in question will be informed of the outcome in the near future.</P>

      <P>Legislation regarding the fitting and use of seat belts in public vehicles is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. Under existing regulations, passenger seat belts are not compulsory in buses, including those operated under the school transport scheme.</P>
      <P>The National Safety Council is to be congratulated on its campaign to promote safety on our roads. There are approximately 3,000 vehicles, including spares, utilised to provide the school transport service. Details regarding the number of buses fitted with seat belts are not available.</P>
      <P>The safety aspects of school transport, including the provision of seat belts, is being examined by the school transport section of my Department in consultation with Bus Éireann and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. When this report is completed and assessed, the question of what improvements can be put in place to further improve the safety of the children who use the service will be considered.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that safety on school transport is of paramount importance to my Department and Bus Éireann, which operates the scheme on behalf of my Department.</P>

      <P>The management team in NEPS is aware that north Kildare is part of an area partnership scheme and that a number of the schools serve disadvantaged populations. Therefore, north Kildare is being given a high priority in the NEPS roll-out plan.</P>
      <P>Two of the NEPS psychologists are about to undertake a preparatory exercise in 12 primary schools in north Kildare. This will include visits to the schools to introduce the psychological service, completion of a needs assessment schedule and provision of inservice training for teachers on screening programmes. This introductory phase will be followed by extension of the full NEPS service to these schools in the next school year.</P>
      <P>The Government decided in late July on a package of measures that would benefit children with special educational needs. One of these measures is the acceleration of recruitment to NEPS so that it should reach the full quota of psychologists by the end of 2002 instead of 2004. I have been concerned for some time about the needs of children in schools that do not yet have access to the psychological service provided by NEPS. I have, therefore, recently made funding available to NEPS to allow such schools to commission psychological assessments from private practitioners. NEPS has drawn up and issued to all schools, including those in north Kildare, guidelines on how to avail of this scheme.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the pharmaceutical technician diploma in Trinity College is not recognised as a course under which students may qualify for free fees; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that two years of study must be completed to be awarded the diploma; if his attention has further been drawn to the hardship this is causing many of the students who are taking the course; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the terms of the free fees initiative the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years' duration at approved <Col N="1316" /> colleges. The pharmaceutical technician diploma course is not an approved course for purpose of the initiative.</P>
      <P>Year one of the two year pharmaceutical technician diploma course is completed at a post-leaving certificate college. Eligible students entering PLC courses are not liable for tuition fees and may, subject to certain conditions, receive grant assistance under my Department's maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses. Year two of the course is completed at Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the terms of the higher education grants scheme were extended to include a one-year course, where this represents progression from an approved PLC course. This extension was included to take particular account of students who, having completed year one of the pharmaceutical technician course, advanced to pursue the second year of the course in Trinity College.</P>
      <P>Apart from the funding provided through the free fees initiative and the student support schemes, funding is also provided by my Department through the student assistance-access fund. The objective of the fund, which is allocated to approved third level colleges, is to assist students who, due to their financial circumstances, might be unable to continue their third level studies. Information is available from the access officer or other officer with responsibility for the fund in each college.</P>

      <P>The areas of County Kildare referred to by the Deputy have been the subject of regular review by my Department in recent years, in view of the general growth in population in the north of the county. At primary level, the position is that, in Naas, a new 16 teacher school is currently in architectural planning. The original brief for this project is being reviewed in light of additional housing developments in the area and consequential increased demand for primary school places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Kill, the need for a 16 classroom school has been identified. However, the current school site does not have the capacity to cater for 16 classrooms and appropriate ancillary accommodation. Accordingly, the Office of Public Works <Col N="1318" /> has been asked to locate a suitable site in Kill for a new school. Pending the delivery of permanent accommodation, temporary accommodation will be provided as necessary to cope with immediate needs.</P>
    <P>In Sallins, a seven classroom extension to St. Laurence's national school, which will bring the capacity of the school to 16 classrooms, is in architectural planning. At post-primary level, the position is that Kill and Sallins form part of the Naas post-primary catchment area. Following an evaluation of post-primary school requirements in the area, building projects were approved for all three schools in the centre. These projects are now at various stages of architectural planning. A review of the accommodation requirements in St. Mary's college was requested by the school authorities and is currently being examined in my Department's planning section. The school will be advised of the outcome of this review. It is envisaged that, when these projects are completed, there will be sufficient accommodation to meet future needs at both primary and post-</P>

      <P>At primary level, with the exception of the north Kildare school project, enrolments in Celbridge have been in gradual decline in recent years. However, there are three projects in architectural planning for primary schools in the Celbridge area. One of these projects, which is currently at tender stage, is to provide a new building for the north Kildare school project.</P>
      <P>The other two projects are at advanced stages of architectural planning. They involve the replacement of temporary classrooms with permanent accommodation and improving the level of ancillary accommodation at Scoil Mochua and Scoil na Mainistreach. It is envisaged that, following the completion of these building projects, there will be sufficient primary school accommodation to meet current and anticipated demand.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level, a new school building was provided for St. Wolstan's community school in 1999. In addition, an application for additional accommodation has been received from the Salesian College. In that regard, the planning and building unit of my Department is awaiting additional information from the school authorities in order to progress the application further.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to monitor school accommodation requirements in the Celbridge area and any additional needs will be addressed as expeditiously as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 536, 541, 542, 543 and 544 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that on my appointment as Minister for Education and Science in January 2000 I made the tackling of disadvantage and disability a priority. With the full support of the Government dramatic and unprecedented advances have been made over the past two and a half years. All children with special needs within the primary system now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs irrespective of their location or the level of need involved.</P>
      <P>The required response may take the form of resource teacher support or special needs assistant support or both, depending on the professionally assessed needs of the individual children. To date, as a result of this development the number of resource teachers supporting special needs children in primary schools has been increased from 104 to approximately 1,000. The number of special needs assistants supporting children with special needs has been increased from less than 300 to approximately 2,500 over the same period. Further resource teacher and special needs assistant posts will continue to be allocated in response to identified needs. All schools have been advised of the procedures to be followed in seeking resource teacher or special needs assistant support.</P>
      <P>At second level, my Department allocates resource posts, child care assistant posts and concessionary teaching hours to ordinary second level schools to cater for special needs pupils. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each case is considered on its merits and determined on the advice of the psychological service. In the last school year, 240 resource posts, 135 child care assistant posts and the equivalent of approximately 142 whole time teacher posts in concessionary teaching hours were allocated to ordinary second level schools to cater for pupils with special needs. We will continue to make further such resources available in response to identified needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases, the level of special need involved can be such as to require placement in a special school or a special class attached to an ordinary school. A range of such facilities is available. Each is dedicated to a particular disability group and each operates at a specially reduced pupil-teacher ratio. For example, the ratio applicable to children with a mild general learning dis<Col N="1322" /> ability in such facilities is 11:1 while the ratio applicable in the case of children with autism or severe-profound disability is 6:1 plus special needs assistants.</P>
    <P>The measures outlined above are now ensuring that children with special needs receive the support they require when and where they require it. We have made a good start and we have much more to do but these measures are giving new hope to children with a disability.</P>

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service Agency was established on 1 September 1999. It has now reached almost half of its ultimate target of 200 psychologists. I announced during the summer that arrangements are being made to accelerate recruitment to NEPS so that it will reach its full complement by the end of the year 2002 instead of 2004. NEPS has delegated authority from my Department to provide an educational psychological service to all children and young people in schools and other approved educational centres. This service includes the provision of psychological assessments, monitoring of progress and support for parents and teachers.</P>
      <P>I recognise the need for some schools and parents to be able to gain access to psychological assessments for their children pending the full development of the NEPS service. I, therefore, recently announced the allocation of £1.25 million so that schools that do not yet have access to NEPS may commission assessments from private practitioners. NEPS issued details of this scheme to all schools some time ago and it is now in operation.</P>

      <P>The table below provides data on pupil-teacher ratios at primary and second level in 1998-99 in European countries for which comparable information is readily available. The country means at OECD, European and EU levels are also provided. Although the pupil-teacher ratio in Ireland is still above the average for European or OECD countries at primary level, it has fallen very significantly at this level over the past decade leading to a considerable narrowing of the gap with the rest of Europe and the OECD. <Col N="1323" /> Moreover, at second level, the pupil-teacher ratio is now at the OECD average having fallen gradually over recent years.</P>
      <P>In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide for further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Since 1998-99, the pupil-teacher ratio has been further reduced at primary level to just under 20:1. Evidence from research on the impact of class size on pupil learning outcomes indicates that, while class size is likely to be of some importance especially where classes are very big, other strategies are also needed to help learning, including investment in quality teaching practice, home-school-community links and school organisation and management.</P>

      <P>At second level, the Deputy will be aware that an additional 1,000 posts were created in the last school year. A proportion of these <Col N="1324" /> posts was utilised to facilitate the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio for appointment purposes from 19:1 to 18:1. The balance was targeted at particular programmes such as the leaving certificate applied, the junior certificate school programme and the stay in school retention initiative. Since this Government came into office, the pupil-teacher ratio at second level has been reduced from approximately 16:1 to under 15:1 in the last school year.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, an additional 200 posts are being created at second level in the current school year and a further 200 posts will be created next year. This increase in posts, combined with an anticipated fall in enrolments, will result in further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio in the sector.</P>
      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio for primary schools has been reduced from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 19.6:1 in the 2000-01 school year. The retention of posts arising from the demographic dividend in the 2000-01 school year, the creation of an additional 350 posts under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness for the 2001-02 school year and the granting of additional resource posts for children with special needs has further reduced the PTR. It is now projected that the PTR for the 2001-02 school year will be 19.0:1. Furthermore, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness it is proposed to appoint an additional 550 primary teachers between the 2002-03 and 2003-04 school years.</P>

      <P>The achievements of students in higher level mathematics this year were better than normal, at foundation level they were about the same as in recent years, while at ordinary level they were below normal. The award of low grades in engineering has not increased. The percentage obtaining a low grade in higher level engineering is lower than that for the past two years, while the percentage obtaining a lower grade in ordinary level engineering is on a par with the figures for the past two years. The overall results for engineering as well as for mathematics at higher level and foundation level are satisfactory. I have already expressed my concern in relation to the incidence of low grades in leaving certificate ordinary level mathematics this year and have asked the inspectorate to prepare a report on the matter. On the basis of the report I will then take appropriate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, however, draw the Deputy's attention to the chief examiner's report for leaving certifi<Col N="1325" /> cate mathematics for 2000 as well as reports on junior certificate mathematics for 1998 and 1999 which are available on my Department's website or directly from my Department. A number of strengths and weaknesses are identified in these reports together with detailed recommendations for teachers and candidates. In addition, the current in-career development programme for teachers of mathematics at junior cycle should have the effect of improving the teaching and learning of mathematics at all levels, as teacher skills are enhanced and the range of classroom teaching strategies is broadened.</P>

      <P>My Department understands that this question relates to a student who was in receipt of a maintenance grant from County Cork VEC, the body charged with administering the grants scheme in this case. The student in question received grant assistance for year one of a degree course at Waterford Institute of Technology in 1999-2000. In 2000-01 he repeated year one and was, therefore, ineligible for grant assistance. The <Col N="1326" /> student recently informed County Cork VEC that he wished to transfer to University College Cork to complete year two of the course, at which point he was advised to re-apply for grant assistance.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes the award of a grant is provisional for the academic year in question and may not be continued in any subsequent academic year, unless the VEC or local authority is satisfied that the provisions of the scheme continue to be complied with. In this regard the VEC or local authority may reassess a candidate in any subsequent year of his or her course to ensure that the reckonable income limits continue to be complied with. While it is not necessary for a candidate to submit a new application to be reassessed, it is necessary for her or him to submit current income and other details.</P>
      <P>My Department understands from County Cork VEC that, in a case where a candidate is being reassessed, it is their practice to ask him or her to submit the necessary current details. The student in question should contact Cork VEC with a view to having his eligibility for grant assistance in the 2001-02 academic year assessed. My Department understands, however, that it will not be necessary for the candidate to submit a new application.</P>

      <P>The current training for speech therapists involves a four year programme in the school of clinical speech and language studies at Trinity College Dublin. Graduates of the course are professionally recognised as speech and language therapists. The Department of Health and Children commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. Pending the completion of the Bacon report as an interim response to the shortage of speech and language therapists, arrangements were made to increase the intake into the programme at Trinity College Dublin by three to 29 for the 2000-01 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bacon report was launched in July 2001 and it concluded that a major expansion in the numbers of therapy professionals was essential over the next 15 years. In relation to speech and language therapy training places, the report recommends an annual increase of 75 training places. An inter-agency working group, compris<Col N="1327" /> ing officials of the two Departments and the Higher Education Authority, has been established to pursue as a priority the issues arising from the report. The Higher Education Authority has invited institutions to submit proposals for the expansion of existing courses and-or the <Col N="1328" /> introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes. The closing date for receipt of such proposals is 15 October. I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to liaise with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to ensure an adequate supply of speech and language therapists.</P>
