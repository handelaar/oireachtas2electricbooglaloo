      <P>Before proceeding with the Order of Business, I have the honour to extend a warm welcome to the President of the Senate of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, Mr. Petr Pithart, accompanied by members of the Senate, who join us in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery this morning.</P>
      <P>Mr. President, your visit demonstrates the continuing co-operation and friendship between our two Parliaments and countries. I express the confident hope that this visit will increase that co-operation and friendship and that it will be to our mutual benefit.</P>

      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices of motion under Standing Order 31 dealing with two separate topics.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public importance requiring immediate attention: the failure of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to deal with the nursing home crisis culminating in the threatened eviction of 11 elderly residents of a nursing home in Ballincollig, County Cork, tomorrow, and if he will outline the immediate steps he will take to remedy this crisis in view of the Ombudsman's report and the fact that the Ombudsman is reporting on this matter to the Committee on Health and Children as we speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>

      <P>There are nine proposals to be put to the House. The first is the proposal on the late sitting. Is that agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this proposal. The Fine Gael Party wants the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach to answer questions <Col N="984" /> after the Gothenburg statements this morning. This Government is now so divided that the Taoiseach is relying on the three musketeers to support him in the House. Cabinet Ministers do not attend anymore and we have all the applicants for any future vacancy lined up for interview in the second row.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unreal that the Gothenburg Summit should be dismissed by way of formal statements and the Opposition is not given any opportunity to hold the relevant Minister and the Taoiseach to account here in the House and to ask the Taoiseach where does the Government now stand on the key European issues. From public statements of Ministers and junior Ministers, there is no leadership, no coherence, no credibility and there is no possibility of this Government leading us forward in a manner which deals adequately with the major European questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is being asked to provide extra time on this first proposal, but extra time for what? I made the request two days ago that the traditional format of reporting back on the summits of the European Council should in this instance be changed because of the significance of the summit coming immediately after the referendum. There should be provision, first and foremost, for the eurosceptics in the Fianna Fáil Party to be able to come out of hiding and in this forum articulate their eurosceptical views and to be countered very effectively by Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Come out, Deputy Kitt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be space for parties other than the three main parties to express their views. There should be space for independent Deputies to express their views on this critical summit. There should be space and time for Deputies in the Labour Party and in the Fine Gael Party who wish to express their views. There should be questions and answers as has been the case in the past. That request was communicated to the Taoiseach when he was here on Tuesday. I understood, and perhaps the Minister for Foreign Affairs can correct me if I am wrong, that what was proffered informally between the two of them was the possibility of a debate in the relevant committee, as was the case before. But we have not been here before and a matter of this importance requires for it to be debated and questioned and argued here in this House in plenary session where the full attention of the fourth estate can be focused in upon what is being said. It is totally unacceptable for this matter to be dealt with in such a way where we get a series of statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> I say to you, Sir, that you will have to look at the way in which you interpret Standing Orders if on the basis of a debate, you rule out questions from individual Deputies two days in advance because it anticipates debate when there will be no debate, there will be a series of statements. Colleagues who put down legitimate questions arising from the outcome of the Gothenburg Summit were ruled out of order because of your narrow interpretation of&mdash;</P>

      <P>Standing Order 34 is very clear. The Chair's interpretation is quite consistent in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying, Sir, and the Committee on Procedure and Privilege will in due course debate this, that the word &ldquo;statements&rdquo; is quite different to the word &ldquo;debate&rdquo;. Ruling out parliamentary questions because they anticipate debate is totally erroneous in my view.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is up to Members to change the Standing Order if they wish that <Col N="986" /> change. It is not up to the Chair. The Chair has no power to change Standing Orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has been consistent down the years in relation to this matter. The Chair has no intention, and let me make this quite clear, of changing the interpretation. The Chair's interpretation is the correct one. It is up to the House to change the rule if it so wishes. Members should not avoid changing the rule if they wish to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All the more reason then, Sir, for a robust opposition to this proposed set of statements confined to a limited number of speakers in this House, without any possibility of holding to account the Government that is now clearly in shambles for what happened in Gothenburg and how it proposes to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party also objects to the current proposal before the House in regard to the limited late sitting. There is no doubt that there is a need for a question and answer session on Gothenburg and if it needs to take longer than is provided for, then let us talk about giving it more time. There is already a precedent for this. We had question and answer sessions about the foot and mouth crisis. We now have an outbreak of foot in mouth disease in the Government. There is now even greater need for question and answer sessions. On the basis of these statements, questions were disallowed from Deputy Gormley and myself and from many other Deputies on the Gothenburg Summit and on the outcome of the Nice referendum. It is a sham to say that these statements will substitute for answering those questions. There needs to be a clear debate, particularly given President Romano Prodi's statement that we were being misled as a people by this Government and the main Opposition parties in saying that enlargement depended on the Nice treaty. Clearly, legally that is not the case. We need clarification. It is the greatest misleading of this House and the people of this country since the foundation of the State. There has been unanimity on the part of the larger parties to mislead the people.</P>

      <P>There have been innumerable precedents in this House where, when a Taoiseach or a Minister makes a statement, an opportunity is given to the Opposition to question the Taoiseach or Minister. On this occasion it is very appropriate that the Opposition would ask questions after the Taoiseach makes his statement on Gothenburg. There is no coherence in Government policy. There is absolute confusion now as to what the Taoiseach intends doing in respect of ratification of the Nice treaty and what his policy is towards enlargement in Europe. We have discordant voices coming from the Minister for Finance who accompanied him to Gothenburg. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, takes a diametrically opposed view to that of the Minister for Finance. We have the passing remarks of the Minister, Deputy de Valera, and we have the contortionist efforts of Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív. In circumstances where the Taoiseach claims to be willing to be accountable to the House, it is reasonable that on this occasion more than any other, he would allow us to ask questions and he would answer them as fully as possible.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Whip is available for any discussions with the Government Whip to come to an appropriate arrangement so that after statements are concluded, we can ask questions. After the Gothenburg statements are concluded, the Order of Business shows that the debate on Nice will continue. We can give up some time on that debate to accommodate questions instead and there will be no loss of progress on the Government's legislative timetable if he agrees to proceed on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is profoundly unsatisfactory. It is no wonder that the people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; when they see the manner in which we treat serious issues here. It is no wonder that they rebel against the advice of the main political parties when those parties are put in such an ineffective position in this House by the Taoiseach forcing through statements without making himself accountable with <Col N="990" /> the effect that the key questions cannot be answered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not say all that I said before. However, having heard what has been said here with conviction, is the Taoiseach now prepared to change the Order of Business to work with the proposal suggested by Deputy Noonan to take part if not all of the hour allocated to the ongoing discussion on Nice as provided for today? That is not to say that matter should end today, but it could be scheduled for another time. That extra hour could be allocated to other parties and individuals and to both wings of Fianna Fáil, including an opportunity for Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, to come in as a Deputy or a citizen or whatever reinvention of himself he chooses, to explain to this House how he was able to advise &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We have the time for all those things. The country is watching us. Are we to have the sort of debate and listening process which has been promised by so many Ministers? </P>
      <P>If we are to have that debate and listening process, today is the day to start and this is the place to do it. There is an hour which can be allocated and the rest of the Government's legislative programme for today will not be affected in any way. I urge the Taoiseach to accept the proposal and let the Whips allocate the time accordingly. Otherwise, we will just have a farce and we may as well fax our statements to each other and give the time to the completion of parliamentary debate because that, in effect, is what will happen. I ask the Taoiseach to respond and to consider a reasonable request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal is entirely unacceptable to the Green Party, Sinn Féin, the Socialists and the Independents. The Government must remember that 54% of the Irish people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The parties in this House who represent that &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote are being excluded from this debate. How can that be called democracy? Is that what the Taoiseach calls democracy? This is the same Taoiseach who said at Gothenburg that the Nice treaty was only about enlargement. Yet Mr. Prodi has come out today and told the truth of what it was about. Of course the Taoiseach does not want debate. He wants to stonewall on the issue. He does not want to reveal the contradictions in his own party on this matter. That is why he is trying to curtail this debate. I can tell him that if he is going to try to stop us from speaking, we will stop him from speaking when he tries here today.</P>

      <P>May I make just a few points? Some months ago I was asked about this procedure which has operated unchanged here for 30 years with regard to statements. It has remained unchanged even though people from all sides of the House have sought change over the years. I certainly did so when in opposition and was refused by the Rainbow Coalition Government at <Col N="992" /> all times. Last Christmas when I was asked about this, I said that it was, perhaps, unsatisfactory and I would be prepared to look at the system. I was then asked to arrange for a debate at the Foreign Affairs Committee and the European Affairs Committee and I provided for that. I do not wish to comment on those meetings or on the number of people who attended, but I did provide the facility which was requested.</P>
      <P>Within recent days, we have had foreign affairs issues in my question time, including preparation for Gothenburg. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also answered questions on the issue. He spent two and a half hours yesterday on the Foreign Affairs Estimate and I understand he is meeting today with the chairperson and others on the European Affairs Committee to discuss possible changes with regard to that committee. If people want further questions at some other committee, we will certainly look at that. However, there is an established practice of statements by the Leaders immediately after European Council meetings and that is what is taking place today.</P>
      <P>I was asked last week to continue the Nice treaty debate and there was a big argument that we were trying to close it down. I agreed to the request. I have also said we are moving as quickly as we can to a forum on Europe in which all the political parties will have their full input. I will again outline the views of the Government today. Those views will be consistent and will remain so.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with item 58 &ndash; Statements on the Euro Summit in Gothenburg &ndash; be agreed to.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach was in Scotland yesterday trying to persuade the Scottish Parliament that it should look to Ireland as a model of good government. While he had his back turned the crisis in his Government deepened. He now leads an Administration that is divided on Europe, on health service funding, on asylum and immigration policy and on local government reform. Having lost control over his Cabinet, he now appears to be losing control of his backbenchers also.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has licensed this rebellion by his weak leadership. Does he agree he is leading a lame duck Administration which does not have the capacity to deal with the key issues facing the Irish people, such as the deteriorating health service, the housing crisis, worsening traffic gridlock and, in particular, the crisis on European policy and the emerging crisis in Northern Ireland?</P>

Does the Taoiseach agree the open revolt of backbenchers while he was away in relation to local government matters and the fact that he can bow to the wishes of four Deputies who are outside the coalition Government yet is incapable of bowing to the wishes of four Deputies who are an intrinsic part of the coalition Government, with respect to the right of asylum seekers being permitted to work once they are six months or longer in this country, is an indication of the disarray in this Administration?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As we approach the deadline of 1 July, a deadline nobody wants but one which is determined by First Minister Trimble as essential if he is to maintain the support of his party, statements were made today by representatives of Sinn Féin, speaking or purporting to speak either on behalf of the Republican leadership or some other nuanced code for the combined leadership of Sinn Féin and the IRA, that the IRA would not bow to a demand for decommissioning from either the Unionist Party or David Trimble. Does the Taoiseach agree the demand for decommissioning comes from the democratically expressed will of an over-riding majority of the Irish people, expressed in two referenda in May 1998, and that the demand for decommissioning is not coming from one section of the political landscape in Northern Ireland but from every person on the island who voted in such overwhelming terms in those referenda? Does he share my view that the people who purport to turn this into a Northern Irish confrontation between representatives of Sinn Féin and the IRA on the one hand and representatives of the Unionist Party on the other are not listening to the democratically expressed view of Irish people on all parts of this island? Using his authority will the Taoiseach ask the leadership of Sinn Féin, who are the people who have access to the people with guns &ndash; as the Taoiseach said so clearly in this House on Tuesday &ndash; to bear in mind that this is not a demand coming from David Trimble but a demand expressed democratically and simultaneously on both parts of this island for the first time since 1918?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach at an early date brief the Opposition on the present state of <Col N="1000" /> negotiations lest, through any lack of information on our part, we would say something which might create a difficulty for the Taoiseach's negotiating position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will arrange that as soon as we get through some important meetings today and tomorrow. As soon as they are completed, the two Governments will have a clear position.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Quinn's point, we are in a dilemma, for one reason or another. As I spelt out here the other day, while Mr. Trimble set a date, which clearly is always unhelpful, it is no different to the date which was set anyway because we said that this issue had to be dealt with before the marching season, which is well nigh ready to start as we can see from the tensions in Northern Ireland in a number of communities.</P>
      <P>There has been a number of difficult days in Northern Ireland and I thank those who have been involved in trying to cool the tensions in the various front line positions where these tensions have been evident. Some of these issues have got quite a good deal of publicity while others have not, but a number of people have worked extremely hard to lessen those tensions.</P>
      <P>The stated position of the two Governments and all of the parties, in reply to Deputy Quinn, is that the Good Friday Agreement will be fully implemented. It is the one issue on which everybody agrees. To deal with that, all of the parties have stated that there are four issues with which they want dealt comprehensively. They have different views on, and different ways of, implementing them and there are different nuances and interpretations, but there are four issues.</P>
      <P>On policing, it is quite clear that the only way of seeking agreement is by sticking as closely as possible to the Patten report. Going short of the Patten report or beyond the Patton report will create difficulties, as I see it.</P>
      <P>Demilitarisation is an important issue to try to reduce the security infrastructure in Northern Ireland, but that has been achieved to quite a degree in the past three years. We are unlikely to see any further developments on that until we see substantive progress on decommissioning and the institutions cannot have security of tenure unless we also deal with the outstanding issues.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we come back to the issue of an understanding on decommissioning on which we can make progress. What the Irish Government is trying to do is make sure we can build on the stated position of 6 May 2000, that arms will be put beyond use in a verifiable way, presumably under the control of General John de Chastelain, as chairperson of the Independent Commission on Decommissioning, to the satisfaction of the public. It is correct to say that the public voted for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people are trying to say that decommissioning did not form a part of the Good Friday Agreement. I would refer them to what was stated in the Good Friday Agreement on decom<Col N="1001" /> missioning. Decommissioning is in the Agreement and it clearly means one thing, that we were to set up a commission to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>I know that imposing deadlines is always unhelpful in Northern Ireland, but the reality is that if the two Governments are to succeed in making sure the will of the people on 22 May 1998 is adhered to, that means decommissioning is one of the issues which must be dealt with. I ask all concerned to make sure that over these coming days they help to create the circumstances where we can do that. They know well how they can do that.</P>
    <P>I want to answer another question which has been raised outside the House because we are coming to important negotiation days on these issues, that is, that the decommissioning did not happen as per the 6 May 2000 deadline because progress was not made on policing and on demilitarisation. The Irish Government's position is that we are ready to try to resolve that issue. We are ready to try to complete the agenda on policing and on demilitarisation and if we can achieve that, it should solve the problem. However, statements made outside of this House that we cannot make any progress because of what happened in May or June 2000 are wrong.</P>
    <P>What is important is that people have stated that they are prepared to deal with the issue of decommissioning, and I welcome that. I understand they are not prepared to make progress until we deal with the issues of policing and demilitarisation. Having spoken to the Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, last night and to the Prime Minister Mr. Blair on Monday, I can say the two Governments are ready to deal with these issues. Therefore, I hope people get down to serious negotiations and try to assist the two Governments in helping the parties achieve what they wish, that is, full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. If we do not get that we will face a real crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share the view that an understandable tolerance was extended from the various political parties in this State and from the London and Dublin Governments to Sinn Féin following the Omagh atrocity, in support their desire to ensure that there would not be a split in the republican movement and a resurgence of support for either Republican Sinn Féin in the ballot box or for the Continuity IRA? Does he share the view that the outcome of the most recent elections in Northern Ireland, which saw Sinn Féin win four seats in Westminster and significantly increase its seats right across the 26 district councils in Northern Ireland, and the failure of Republican Sinn Féin to manifest any evidence of electoral support, negates the pleas made in private or in subtext or in the nuances of the code of what constitutes political progress and dialogue, that Sinn Féin needs to maintain the presence of the IRA or that decommissioning might be seen to be premature against that background? If the Taoiseach shares that analysis, can <Col N="1002" /> he assure the House that when he next meets the leadership of the Republican movement &ndash; we know Sinn Féin and the IRA are two sides of the one coin as the Taoiseach has said frequently in this House &ndash; he will make it clear, with all of the authority he can muster on behalf of all of the democrats in this Assembly and all of the citizens in this State, that the tolerance which has been extended by us in encouraging Sinn Féin down the democratic path will come to an end if the Good Friday Agreement is sabotaged by its intransigence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I share those sentiments. We must find a way of dealing with all of the outstanding issues, one of which is decommissioning. Let us not forget the other issues which must be dealt with to achieve a comprehensive agreement.</P>
      <P>As I have said continually and as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has said, we expect the Republican movement to play its role in finding a resolution to this issue. Even last night the movement said it was prepared to find a resolution to the decommissioning issue but not in this or that circumstance. The only circumstances in which we and the British Government are asking them to resolve this issue of decommissioning is in the context of the full implementation of the Agreement.</P>

That is what we will be seeking to do but I emphasis that we cannot do that without people being prepared to come to the negotiating table in a meaningful way, and that is the current dilemma.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste accepts that the information she gave was incorrect. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, has asked the parliamentary council to accord priority to the Bill. The Bill was published last December and passed Second Stage in the Dáil on 14 February. Since then the ICTU wrote to the Minister of State with further detailed observations and it was necessary to forward these to the parliamentary council for clarification on the legal issues involved and the points raised. On receipt of this, Committee Stage will be taken as a matter of urgency with a view to enacting the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, I attended the European Council meeting held in Gothenburg, Sweden, on 15 and 16 June. On the evening before the Council itself, together with the other European Union Heads of State or <Col N="1007" /> Government, I had dinner with the President of the United States, Mr. Bush, who had earlier taken part in a formal EU-US summit meeting with Prime Minister Persson and President Prodi. Directly after the meeting of the European Council there was a working lunch involving the 15 EU member states, the 12 candidate states with which accession negotiations are under way and Turkey. I had pre-arranged bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Blair and Prime Minister Buzek of Poland and, as is normal, I had numerous informal conversations with colleagues from both member and applicant states. I have arranged for a copy of the Presidency conclusions from the European Council to be laid before the House.</P>
      <P>Before I move on to the business of the summit I wish to comment on the disturbances that took place on the streets of Gothenburg during our meeting. They were disgraceful. I do not believe any cause can, or should, benefit from premeditated violence and vandalism of the type we saw. While the great majority of the protesters were genuinely peaceful, it is clear that a hard core set out to deliberately cause the maximum possible disruption and distraction. I hope those individual and the groups who genuinely wish to promote critical dialogue on issues such as the environment and world trade think carefully on how best they can disassociate themselves from the thuggery of a few.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that during the Council so many citizens were inconvenienced and so many businesses damaged. I hope matters have very quickly got back to normal.</P>
      <P>It would be unfortunate and unfair if the events in Gothenburg were considered to have distracted in any way from the success of the Swedish Presidency. Its handling of the Union's agenda has been efficient and sensitive and considerable progress has been made in many areas, above all with regard to enlargement. Sweden has demonstrated, just as others have in the past, ourselves included, that the smaller member states of the Union can play a very positive and distinctive role. I congratulate it on its success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the outcome of the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice was, inevitably, a major topic of discussion at the European Council and at our meeting with the applicant states. Before going to Gothenburg, I <Col N="1008" /> asked the presidency for the opportunity to make a statement at the start of the meeting on the matter to ensure our partners at the highest level were fully aware of the Government's thinking. I also released my statement to the media and spoke in similar terms at the Union's meeting with the applicants. I have arranged to have my statement laid before the House, but it is important for me to place on the record exactly what I said.</P>
    <P>I began by explaining that ratification of the treaty by Ireland requires an enabling amendment of our Constitution and it was on this that the people voted. I said this was the fifth referendum to be held in Ireland on a European matter since 1972. The previous four referenda on Ireland's accession, the Single European Act and the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam all passed comfortably, even if the margin of success had been gradually declining. I explained that, on this occasion, the referendum was defeated by 54% to 46%. Of our 41 parliamentary constituencies, 39 voted against and the overall turnout was less than 35% of the total electorate &ndash; by some way the lowest in any EU referendum to date.</P>
    <P>I said to my European colleagues, as I said last week in the House and elsewhere, that the Government was profoundly disappointed by the result. We have consistently argued to the public that the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is necessary for the enlargement of the Union; that enlargement is not alone an historic duty but a major opportunity&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;that enlargement is not alone an historic duty, but a major opportunity for the existing members of the Union as well as for the candidate countries; and that the changes included in the treaty, which was a hard fought compromise, did not in any way affect Ireland's basic interests or threaten our values. I emphasised, however, that, while regretting it, at the same time we fully respect the democratic legitimacy of the people's decision.</P>
      <P>I also sought to make it absolutely clear that, in my view, the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote should not be interpreted as a vote against enlargement. Most of the leading &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigners were at pains to say they supported enlargement and this has since been repeated by them. Last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs personally reassured his colleagues in the applicant countries that Ireland remains fully committed to enlargement and to the successful conclusion of the accession negotiations. I solemnly reiterated that pledge.</P>
      <P>I went on to say that it is now necessary for us to reflect carefully and patiently on how to move on from here. In that I asked for the support of my colleagues and their Governments. I said that the Irish Government very much appreciated their readiness, as expressed in Luxembourg at the General Affairs Council on 11 June, to contribute in every possible way to help us to find a way forward, taking into account the concerns reflected by the result of the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would have been premature on Friday for me to begin to discuss how specifically the difficult situation in which we now find ourselves might be resolved. I repeated that we genuinely need, at national level, an extended period of reflection. <Col N="1010" /> I told the Council that the Government has announced the establishment of a national forum on Europe and I made it clear that I hoped this will allow for a more systematic and extensive debate on the European Union and its future direction than has ever before proved possible. There are also important questions to be considered regarding how our national Parliament scrutinises EU business.</P>
    <P>I said that, nevertheless, I believed it is already apparent that many of the concerns, anxieties and uncertainties which led to the result &ndash; and to the very high level of abstentions &ndash; go well beyond the terms of the treaty itself. The result of our referendum graphically underscores what all those present at the European Council already knew &ndash; that there is, unfortunately, a widespread sense of disconnection between the institutions of the Union and its citizens. There is frustration at what is sometimes seen as an absence of clarity, openness and responsiveness in how the Union goes about its business. There is a real and urgent need to focus on how we can make the Union more meaningful to our citizens and on how its democratic accountability can be strengthened. I feel very strongly about this aspect.</P>
    <P>I admitted that it is easier to diagnose the problem than to prescribe widely acceptable remedies. I also know that there are many misconceptions and misunderstandings which unjustly shape popular perceptions of the Union. Nevertheless, I stressed to colleagues that it is vital that this dimension be kept at the forefront of our thinking throughout the entire forthcoming debate on the future of the Union. At the end of my statement, I thanked each of my colleagues personally for their understanding. I said that the Irish Government is determined to work with them to find a mutually acceptable way forward which will help lead to the outcome all of us are committed to achieving, namely a successful enlargement of the Union.</P>
    <P>Both at the European Council itself and at the meeting with the applicant states, I was heartened by the positive response to what I said. There was an unquestioning recognition of the validity and integrity of our own national constitutional processes. It was widely accepted that the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote should not be seen as a rejection of enlargement by the Irish people, although, as Deputies will be aware, there remains in some quarters across Europe a degree of suspicion that this might be the case.</P>

      <P>This makes it imperative that we continue to do all we can to demonstrate that this is not so. In the Council conclusions, partners restated their willingness to contribute in every possible way to helping to find a way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My views about the sense of disconnection <Col N="1011" /> between the institutions of the Union and its citizens were very widely shared and there was an acceptance that this must be at the heart of what we do in the future. As the conclusions indicate, there was agreement that &ldquo;the Union must be served by modern, open and citizen-oriented institutions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Enlargement was the major theme of the Council and of the Swedish Presidency as a whole. The clear message from our partners also is that the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice is a necessary condition of the enlargement process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the question. I saw the headlines this morning and I checked what was said. I understand Mr. Prodi, who was asked this question this morning during interviews in Stockholm, said that he wished to put the record straight to the effect that whatever might be technically feasible from a legal point of view, this must not be confused with political imperatives. He believes the changes contained in the Nice treaty are necessary for an enlarged Union to work and so the treaty is a political condition for enlargement.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this is fully in line with the view of the European Council in Gothenburg last week. It said that the ratification process for the Treaty of Nice will continue so that the Union is in a position to welcome new member states from 2002 and the strongly shared view of the member states is that ratification of the Treaty of Nice is necessary for enlargement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has rightly said, there is a need for mutual respect. We have asked our partners to respect the outcome of our referendum and they do so. However, at the same time, we need to respect their views and their own national parliamentary and constitutional procedures. They are fully entitled to continue their own ratification processes and it would have been wrong for me to go to Gothenburg and try to press them to stop. Just as Ireland has the right to make up its own <Col N="1012" /> mind by itself, so too others have the right to make up their own minds.</P>
      <P>The entry into force of the treaty requires ratification by all 15 member states. If, by the end of 2002, not all have ratified, the treaty will not be able to enter into force as envisaged. Let there be no doubt that whatever hypothetical options may exist, the political reality in the view of the member states is that this would create major difficulties and would constitute a clear obstacle to enlargement on the basis all have been working on to date. We should all accept this fact. How we resolve the difficulties is genuinely a matter for further deep reflection. We all need time and space to consider the implications of this and to try to build some form of consensus on how to proceed.</P>
      <P>Intensive work is continuing on preparing draft terms of reference for the national forum on Europe and on coming up with proposals on such key questions as its composition and working methods. I hope soon to be in a position to begin to discuss these issues with the Opposition parties so that it might be possible to reach broad agreement before the summer break with a view to the forum starting its work in the early autumn.</P>
      <P>On enlargement, the European Council agreed that significant breakthroughs have been achieved in the accession negotiations under the Swedish Presidency and we are further ahead than was envisaged six months ago. While of course some important issues remain to be addressed, considerable progress has been made on such key areas of concern as the free movement of workers and the free movement of capital. Overall, more than two thirds of the negotiating chapters have been closed with the leading accession candidates. It was agreed that the overall road map for the negotiations which was adopted at Nice has managed to be both ambitious and realistic and it will continue to guide the incoming Belgian and Spanish Presidencies.</P>
      <P>As the Council stated, this momentum has to be matched by continuing progress in the candidate countries in making the internal preparations they need to complete to meet the challenge of membership. There was a recognition of the need to devote special efforts to Bulgaria and Romania. The Council also restated the very important principle of differentiation, which means that candidate countries will continue to be judged solely on their individual merits.</P>
      <P>Surveying the position overall, the European Council confirmed that the enlargement process is irreversible. We agreed that, provided progress towards meeting the accession criteria continues unabated, it should be possible by the end of 2002 to complete negotiations with those candidate countries which are ready. The objective is that they should participate in the European Parliament elections of 2004 as members. This last phase marks a step forward from what could be agreed six months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Union sent out a very strong and clear <Col N="1013" /> message that enlargement remains on course. This has been very positively welcomed by the accession countries. Certainly the Polish Prime Minister, Professor Buzek, was very welcoming of this position at my bilateral meeting with him. One purpose of the meeting was to emphasise the particular interest of Irish business in the Polish market. This underlines the potential value of enlargement and of the wider internal market it will help achieve. The greater prosperity of the new members, the strengthening of their administrative and judicial systems, and their adhesion to the EU's rules and policies in matters like competition policy, will all create valuable new opportunities. I spoke to Polish journalists with the Prime Minister and with journalists from other applicant countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs in his remarks will say something about the Council's consideration of external relations issues, including the Middle East and the Balkans, and of progress in the European security and defence policy. However, having attended the dinner with President Bush, I want to say a little about the EU-US relationship. Both sides agreed on the continuing fundamental importance of this relationship, and reconfirmed our core values and shared objectives. There is a need to ensure that dialogue between us continues to be frank and constructive. At a personal level, as was the case when I met him in Washington in March, President Bush was very engaged with the issues and presented his country's position forcefully and clearly, but in a positive and non-confrontational manner.</P>
    <P>At the dinner, much of the discussion was about climate change. We noted, in a very honest and direct way, our disagreement over the Kyoto Protocol and its ratification. However, we expressed our shared determination to meet our national commitments and obligations under the climate change convention. The European Council welcomed the commitment by the US not to block the Kyoto process and to work constructively at the forthcoming COP-6 meeting in Bonn next month. A high level group of personal representatives is also being established to take forward dialogue on climate change.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased that at the dinner we also discussed the HIV-AIDS crisis, especially in Africa. We agreed that there is a need for an integrated and comprehensive approach, and in particular the need to facilitate the broadest possible provision of drugs in an affordable and medically effective manner was emphasised.</P>
    <P>At the European Council we also discussed a range of social and economic issues, flowing from our Stockholm meeting in March. Recognising the current weakening in growth prospects, we agreed that, while the fundamentals of the European economy remain strong, it is important to continue vigorously to pursue modernisation.</P>
    <P>Apart from enlargement, however, the main other issue we discussed was sustainable development. The environment was one of the Swedish Presidency's main priorities. We agreed a strategy <Col N="1014" /> for sustainable development, which essentially means meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising those of future generations. It was agreed that there will be better policy co-ordination within the Union, including the integration of environmental questions with social and economic issues in the Lisbon process. The global dimension of what happens in Europe was recognised. Finally, four main environmental priorities for sustainability were identified: combating climate change; ensuring sustainable transport; addressing threats to public health; and managing natural resources more responsibly.</P>
    <P>It was, therefore, a highly successful European Council which did very good business across a wide range of issues. It underscores yet again just how indispensable the European Union is in promoting action and co-operation for our common good in areas where it makes sense for us to work together. By pooling our sovereignty in appropriate areas all of the member states, and more importantly all of our people, are better off than we would conceivable be on our own. This European Council was important in bringing closer the day on which we will be able to welcome new members, which I am convinced is the strong wish of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.</P>
      <P>In a number of important respects the summit at Gothenburg last week was a unique experience for an Irish Head of Government. It was unique because of the level of interest on the part of our partners in the outcome of the referendum on the Nice treaty, because of an unprecedented split in the Irish delegation and because of the Taoiseach's failure to take away even a crumb of comfort from our EU partners as to how we might deal with the roadblock which has now been created on the road to enlargement.</P>
      <P>Irish Heads of Government have gone to many summits over the past 36 years in circumstances where we have faced difficulties. On every occasion they have managed, through clever groundwork in negotiation, to come away with a satisfactory outcome. They have been able to do this, not least because of the goodwill built up over the years through Governments taking a constructive part in all Community activities. They have also been able to do this because Fine Gael and the Labour Party have built up a network of contacts at European political party level to a point where, in Fine Gael's case, the European People's Party exerts majority influence in the European Parliament. Both Fine Gael and Labour are active members of the European political party groupings and, incidentally, both Deputy Quinn and myself last week at Gothenburg gave full public and private backing to the Taoiseach at the meetings of our respective groupings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that Fianna Fáil does not belong to any such grouping puts the Taoiseach at a disadvantage at summits, and particularly at this <Col N="1015" /> summit. He was at an even greater disadvantage because of the Minister for Finance's very public and unnecessary row with the Commission on budgetary policy earlier this year. While this row may have had sections of the home gallery cheering for him, it resulted in a serious diminution in European Union goodwill for Ireland. The diminution of goodwill could not have come at a worse time. In Gothenburg the Taoiseach was faced, for the first time ever, with an atmosphere where there was some doubt, even before the outcome of the Nice treaty referendum, about Ireland's commitment to the current EU arrangements.</P>
    <P>As some European finance Ministers have already pointed out to Deputy McCreevy, Ireland has at all times been a party to the negotiation of these arrangements. A Minister for Finance, therefore, was refusing to comply with guidelines which had been negotiated and agreed by himself. So the Taoiseach found himself in Gothenburg, against the background, not only of the negative referendum outcome but of the damage created by the extraordinary behaviour of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>Unbelievably, the Minister for Finance added recklessly to the Taoiseach's difficulties by playing, in Gothenburg, the Eurosceptic card. We now know he did so in a deliberate and calculated manner. He was not trapped into it in the heady atmosphere of a summit by a persistent and tough questioner. He sought out the opportunity to make his point. Subsequently, when questioned, his spokesperson went out of his way to confirm the position the Minister had taken.</P>
    <P>In any other country or party, leadership would have been exercised and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, would either have been silenced, called on to retract his comments or asked to resign. What did the Taoiseach do? He simply shrugged his shoulders and said: &ldquo;That's Charlie for you&rdquo;. The Taoiseach should know that explanation is not enough now, no more than when he said the same thing in relation to the use by one of his predecessors as leader of Fianna Fáil of a book of blank cheques. It was not an adequate response then and it is not adequate now, when we are talking about a different Charlie.</P>
    <P>European summits are important events where goodwill is built up which can be used when we face difficult negotiating positions on issues of national importance. In the annals of Ireland's participation in summits over 36 years, Gothenburg is the only self-inflicted wound. I sincerely hope the Taoiseach has learned a lesson and will apply it to ensure there is no repeat performance.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should not have been too surprised by the dismal performance at Gothenburg. Since the formation of the Government four years ago, the Taoiseach has seriously diluted its EU agenda. He is the first Taoiseach in recent years not to have appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs to pull together, at political level, the European efforts of various Ministers and Departments. Former <Col N="1016" /> Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputies Tom Kitt and Gay Mitchell exercised this function. The Taoiseach made an abortive attempt to appoint Deputy David Andrews as Minister for European Affairs but the initiative was vetoed by then Minister for Foreign Affairs, former Deputy Ray Burke, after which the Taoiseach did nothing. Unlike the administrations of his three predecessors, the Taoiseach does not have a Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs.</P>

      <P>As Taoiseach he has done nothing about the all-party Committee's recommendation to use the Seanad to review EU regulations and directives. At this late stage I urge that this recommendation be implemented in full. I assure the Taoiseach of the wholehearted support of the Fine Gael Party to achieve this.</P>
      <P>It is comical to hear the Attorney General talk about the undemocratic nature of EU directives when the same directives have to be sanctioned domestically before they can be signed in Europe and that, as part of that sanctioning, they are put through the Attorney General's office. It is ironic that the Attorney General lectures us on the undemocratic nature of directives when the Taoiseach is responsible for ordering business in the House and has ignored the all-party committee's recommendation that the Seanad should be used as a European chamber, in which EU directives are scrutinised.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has also contributed to the democratic deficit of the European Union by dropping the publication of the Government's six-monthly report on EU developments relating to Ireland. A summary or reprise of what happened in Europe had always been presented to the Dáil and the Seanad. That practice has now stopped. It is a disgrace that the last such report covers the first half of 1999 and was not published until 16 months later in October 2000.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach heads a Fianna Fáil Party which is all over the place on Europe. His Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is proud of his euro-scepticism, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, can not even find her way to Brussels &ndash; the record shows that she is one of the worst attendees at Council of Minister meetings &ndash; and the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuiv, has truly contorted himself by canvassing for, and voting against, the Nice treaty.</P>
      <P>Four days later the Taoiseach has still not done anything to heal the Government split manifested in Gothenburg. He has allowed his Ministers free rein and has not imposed a single sanction. In a scene reminiscent of <i>&ldquo;Après Match&rdquo;</i> the Attorney General has become a vocal critic of Government policies, to which he made a significant contribution during formulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's role in the future of Europe is too serious to be treated with the contempt that this <Col N="1017" /> Government is showing. We need constructive contributions to the debate, a unified approach at Government level and, above all, leadership from the Taoiseach. He must clearly set out the Government's objectives. We need coherence, ministerial backing for these stated objectives and a team approach to their fulfilment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Observing this shambles of a Government in action, I am reminded of the words of WB Yeats in &ldquo;The Second Coming&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;</P>
      <P>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.</P>
      <P>On a political level I am delighted to see this Government falling apart. However, my political joy is tempered by one major concern. One of the major issues causing internal Government tension is our relationship with our European neighbours. Most Members will agree that our assured and massive access to the European market has been a major magnet for mobile international investment into Ireland over the past 25 to 30 years creating tens of thousands of well paid jobs.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware &ndash; I refer, in particular, to the current choice between Ireland and Hungary &ndash; that investment decisions are already being called into question because of the uncertainty created by the Government about our future in Europe. Ambiguity, ambivalence and indecision in the Government parties is a total turn-off for those who make these investment decisions involving hundreds of millions of dollars. Euro-sceptic talk is cheap but it will have an enormous national cost unless the Government is able to present a coherent united front on an issue of such fundamental importance. I do not intend to further parade the growing list of provisional Europeans in the Government ranks who question the official Government line. Yeats had a line for them, &ldquo;The best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In reviewing the meeting in Gothenburg, it is fairly clear that 14 member states, with Ireland's consent or acquiescence, have agreed the Treaty of Nice will be ratified by the end of 2002 and the process of enlargement will proceed apace. One can conclude from the Gothenburg meeting that it is clear that as far as the other member states are concerned the defeat of the referendum proposal in Ireland is regarded as an Irish difficulty and, by implication, it is not a problem for the European Union or the other 14 member states. The Gothenburg meeting also made clear that the treaty is not open to re-negotiation. That, too, has been accepted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where does that leave us? I had hoped the Taoiseach would give an indication of the future of the Treaty of Nice as far as Ireland is concerned. It raises the question of when we will be told what Government policy is. The real question, however, is when there will be a Government policy and, once decisions are taken, will they have the full support of all Government members and parties? We have, again, an official <Col N="1018" /> and a provisional Government policy. Will some members of the Government support policy in a public capacity but not in a private capacity? If, after Gothenburg and the referendum, that is the end result of the deliberations of this Government, it will be a sure recipe for further failure.</P>
    <P>Let us return to the question of what we should do now. Is it not obvious that there will be a second referendum? If we want to continue to fully participate in the development and enlargement of Europe, there will have to be a further referendum. The sooner that issue is confronted, the better. It is also important that we learn from the mistakes and failures of the Government in the last referendum. This primarily means the timing and arrangements must permit a proper debate and information campaign. I accept that there should be a reasonable period of reflection. This Government is in obvious need of it to enable it to formulate a policy and, I hope, secure the full support of its members therefor.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at the reasons people voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the last referendum. There are people who oppose membership of the European Union.</P>
    <P>With all the obvious benefits and no matter what the issue, there are people who will still vote against it. We must accept that it is their entitlement. There are others who are against the enlargement of the Union. We must accept that also. It is clear that the vast majority of the 18% of the electorate who voted against the Treaty of Nice do not fall into either of those categories. It is also very important that the prominent spokespersons of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign proclaimed their support for enlargement. Given that the Treaty of Nice is principally designed to facilitate the enlargement of the Union, and to enable the enlarged Union to operate effectively and efficiently without individual member states of the 27 being able to veto virtually any proposal, it is critical that we isolate the reasons or the perceived reasons that led the majority to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I would have expected some analysis of that from the Government.</P>
    <P>I would also have thought that people from the European Union and in particular from the Commission would be careful and sensitive towards the situation here. President Prodi's comments on the enlargement of the Union and his manner of their expression were not helpful to the debate. I am glad the Taoiseach had the opportunity of clarifying that issue following the intervention from Deputy Gormley. It is an indication of how important it is for people like President Prodi to be careful in the way in which they express their views. They should be sensitive to the issues that confront people domestically.</P>
    <P>It is important that there be an informed debate on the main issues and that it is not conducted in the hot-house atmosphere that we have had since the referendum result. It is also important not to have the hot air that we have had from different elements of the Government parties on the issue. We need a balanced and <Col N="1019" /> informed debate rather than slogans on neutrality and militarism. The myth of the European super state needs to be confronted. There are strong federalists who have expressed views but it is totally dishonest to suggest that these views are represented in the Treaty of Nice and that issue has to be confronted.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the Labour Party's proposal for the forum. However, I understood the forum was principally designed to deal with the post-Nice treaty position. The four principal issues, the division of responsibilities within the member states, the charter, the simplification of the treaties, and the role of national parliaments. I enthusiastically endorse the forum. I have some concerns about the way the Government has hijacked the Labour Party proposal for the forum to use it as a sticking-plaster approach to the Treaty of Nice problem.</P>

      <P>I have heard a great deal of criticism from people speaking both publicly and privately about the inadequacy of the monitoring of EU legislation. People used that as a reason for voting against the Treaty of Nice. I would expect more sense from people, bearing in mind the positions which they occupy. If they want to criticise anyone for that, they should criticise the Government. It is a matter for the Government to put in place the appropriate procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four years ago, I as chairman assisted in completing a report on the Seanad which focused on that very issue. The report suggested that the Seanad should be the bridgehead to Europe, it highlighted the deficiencies in relation to this very issue. That report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution has been on the Taoiseach's desk since the day he took up office, has been on the Attorney General's desk since he took up office, and nothing has been done. If there is a complaint against anybody or people wish to vote against anything or anybody, because of the inadequate procedure we have in place here for monitoring Community legislation, <Col N="1020" /> then complain about the Government and vote against the Government and do not confuse people on that issue.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Proinsias De Rossa.</P>
      <P>It is rare that events in Ireland dominate the European political agenda, but the Gothenburg summit was one such occasion. The backdrop to the summit was dominated by two events, the outcome of the Nice referendum in Ireland and the first visit of the new US President, George W. Bush, to Europe. I attended a meeting of the PES leaders and dealt with the issue of referendum and was pleased that I got a better reception than that which seems to have been accorded to Deputy Noonan at his gathering. Emotions continue to run high about the outcome of the referendum, something which Ministers have sought to stoke since the result came in. Initially the reaction to the result from Europe was particularly unhelpful. Suggestions that the enlargement of the Union can go ahead to deal with all the accession states regardless of the Irish result are simply untrue and <i>ultra vires</i> the treaty itself. Frustration at one level is understandable. Accession negotiations have been going better than expected under the Swedish Presidency and it is no doubt a difficult job to do to explain in the accession countries, where the Enlargement Commissioner, Gunter Verheugen, found himself, that things have changed. On that note I congratulate the Swedish presidency for an excellent six months of work, as has the Taoiseach. Nevertheless it would be a bad day's work and counter-productive for the European Union if it was seen to ride roughshod over its own structures which are already held in some disrepute by its citizens.</P>
      <P>In that context I am deeply unhappy with the remarks attributed to the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi. The European treaties are not something to be played with, their spirit should be adhered to. If the Nice treaty falls &ndash; and remarks like that of Mr Prodi help ensure that it will &ndash; then enlargement beyond the 20 members currently allowed for is a matter for another Intergovernmental Conference. It will inevitably be delayed. Sadly, the clarification or correction which the Taoiseach read into the record of the House fell on very deaf ears and will not get front page <i>Irish Times</i> coverage in the way that we saw today. That said, I do not believe the vote in Ireland was a vote against enlargement. I agree with the Attorney General that a European Union which comprises a greater number of smaller states will be an easier one for countries like Ireland to work and prosper in. However, to do so our Government will have to drop its obsession with inter-governmentalism, particularly with the UK, and to support the role of the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless again we have to accept that the <Col N="1021" /> result of our referendum is such as to delay the enlargement procedures. That is not something with which I feel comfortable, but it is a reality. It is time for a period of reflection on all the issues involved so that they can be debated in a mature fashion. At one level it is not necessarily contradictory to say that enlargement can go ahead despite the Irish vote. As has been pointed out, there is provision for a further five new members under existing treaty law. Although I do not envy anybody the job of telling them it has to come out of a hat if more than five applicant states are deemed to qualify to join. There will be other treaties. There is an Intergovernmental Conference scheduled for 2004, for example. Issues can be addressed there.</P>
    <P>What has happened while and since the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs attended the summit is a source of more immediate concern, certainly to me. The contributions by the Ministers Deputies de Valera Ó Cuiv and McCreevy are deeply cynical. As one editorial put it yesterday the time to intervene, as members of the Government, about the Nice treaty was before it was signed. Remember, the treaty was only signed formally in February although negotiations concluded in December. All these Ministers had plenty of time to reflect on what had occurred. Some of us who had reservations about the treaty also had time to reflect but we at least have stuck by decisions we made then.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in playing politics with this issue. In a way, I do not need to. The Taoiseach's Ministers are doing a good enough job undermining their own party leader without assistance from me. That it conveys an impression of a Cabinet without any courage, coherence or leadership is inescapable. The comments made by junior Ministers, Deputies O'Donnell and Kitt yesterday can only be understood in that context. The failure of the Taoiseach to speak with a clear voice is prompting others to do so. The result is further dangerous division. It also conveys the impression of a deeply conservative Cabinet.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste has suggested that Ireland's &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote to the treaty was not influenced by the fact that Ireland would no longer receive European funds. I am, on balance, inclined to agree with her. For my part I have argued for a number of years that the end of the begging bowl era presented an opportunity for us to be more assertive in Europe. Sadly, it is not a position the Government adopted, choosing instead to get the ultimate out of the begging <Col N="1022" /> bowl, and I think accordingly a chance to engage the Irish people in a new dialogue about Europe was lost. I do think that becoming net contributors to the Union is having a profound effect on the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Let me expand. The end of the &ldquo;funding&rdquo; era has come with the end of another European project in which we are participating &ndash; the completion of the Single Market and the single currency. It seems these are the only two projects in which Irish conservatives are truly interested. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Attorney General are big business, small government people. They reject the European social model and do not want anything to do with it. Part-time working directives and consultation rights for workers are not on their list of priorities or on the list of priorities for the Government. For them it is critical that Europe takes minimalist positions on social and environmental issues. The issue is simply free trade. For them a process of intellectual disengagement has begun and it puts their support for the Amsterdam Treaty &ndash; the first European Treaty on social issues &ndash; in a poor light.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General's contribution to the debate was an interesting one although far less so than his media champions suggest. He was implicitly critical of himself and the Government but let us deal with the issues he raised. The use of language like &ldquo;federalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;super state&rdquo; is deliberately designed to be emotive. We are already part of a federal arrangement of sorts when we pool some sovereignty. The word is commonly used by eurosceptics to convey the notion of a united states of Europe along the lines of the United States of America. There are, in my experience, few adherents to this view of the future of Europe as a single united states of Europe analogous to, identical to or similar to that of the United States of America. Similarly words like &ldquo;constitution&rdquo; are used in the same fashion. Again the Attorney General seeks to convey the impression of a monolithic state but I have another take on the issue of a constitution.</P>
      <P>What are European treaties but a series of basic laws save in this case presented in a fashion that is totally and utterly intractable for its citizens? No European citizen can acquire a copy of its basic law in the same fashion that Irish citizens can purchase copies of Bunreacht na hÉireann. That is what I think a European constitution can offer its citizens &ndash; clarity and perspective. It need not be an integrationist project but it could demystify the language and ownership of the debate about the European Union issues that helps alienate it from its citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other fundamental issue raised by the Attorney General is the issue of accountability. On that we are at one. The Dáil has not fulfilled its obligations to scrutinise European decision making properly. To be more precise, it is the decision making of the Irish Executive outside the Dáil and particularly in Europe that is not sufficiently scrutinised. There is a tendency of late <Col N="1023" /> to blame Europe for all our failings even when it is clear the failings are our own.</P>
    <P>This is an issue the Labour Party raised during the debate on the treaty. Today we have published our European Union Bill that addresses this issue. We are doing so because we have said we would and because measures such as we are proposing should have been implemented years ago. It is not part of any attempt to revisit the people's decision. We seek merely to correct a failing of our own. Similarly we pointed out during the campaign that excessive secrecy attaches to the way the European Union, and particularly Irish Ministers acting in the European Union &ndash; I confess my own guilt in relation to this procedure, it is not unique to the current Administration &ndash; do their business and I believe the Freedom of Information Act should apply to the maximum extent possible here.</P>
    <P>We disagree with the Attorney General and the constitutional review group on one issue which is that the Seanad should be designated the body to review European legislation. That view fails to recognise the expertise garnered by Members of both Houses in respect of specialist committee memberships. It makes sense to us that if there is a transport issue facing an Irish Minister in Europe, the body it should be asked to consult with is the Oireachtas committee charged with these issues. Co-ordination of policy and/or difficulties that arise seem to us to demand this approach. However, we are prepared to listen to what others have to say.</P>
    <P>One newspaper has congratulated the Attorney General on being the first to make an important contribution about the future of Europe and Ireland's relationship to it. That remark needs to be put in context. A formal debate about the future of Europe has been under way since 7 March. One of the strengths of the Nice treaty was that it recognised how limited its scope was and ordained that a proper debate about the ultimate destination of the European project take place. This is a source of concern to many people and is used, as per the Attorney General, to strike anti-European poses.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that the debate about Europe has been taking place and in which contributions by other member states should be seen. We should not have an inferiority complex about this. We should be making our voice heard. Our views on Europe are as important as those of the French or Germans. It is the manifest failure of the Government to make any voice heard that creates the impression that we are being lectured at by others. Why should the Taoiseach not do some thinking aloud himself on behalf of the Government? I suspect the reality is that he has no position or, alternatively, as his Cabinet manifests, an array of positions.</P>
    <P>That does not mean there is a monolithic view among others that is to be imposed on us. The French and the Germans, for example, do not agree so there is little chance of them ganging up <Col N="1024" /> on us, as the impression was so assiduously created elsewhere. There is no point in criticising the French or the Germans or anybody else for participating in a debate that we are all entitled to join in. In fact there are Irish citizens making their views known on this debate on the Europe website.</P>
    <P>Until Monday however, the Irish Government was silent and even the Attorney General claims to have been speaking in a personal capacity. This is no way to run Government policy in an area critical to our well being. The Taoiseach has talked in the past about the debate only beginning at the Laeken Council in December. I hope he has been disabused of that notion by now. If not today's newspsper coverage of his leadership role should convince him.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by the Government to accept the Labour Party proposal for a national forum on Europe. It was a generous response from the Government and I wholeheartedly welcome it. I do not know that any forum can actually achieve national consensus given the wide range of various views on this issue but it must do a job in exploring all the issues in their full complexity. For too long the debate about Europe has been dominated by specialist groups such as the IFA, ICTU and IBEC along with our own Civil Service. The language has been dominated by European institutions in terminology that is inaccessible to most citizens who have little hope of getting to grips with the intricate workings of the Union, the Council of Ministers, the role of the President, the Commission and the Parliament. What the people did on 7 June has given notice that that era is over. The national forum for Europe originally conceived in respect of the Intergovernmental Conference 2004 project can now do that in respect of where we find ourselves now.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier the other significant event was the arrival of US President Bush. I am no less uneasy about the global intentions of the new President than I was before. Our own position on global warming may not be a good one &ndash; another of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's failures &ndash; but at least we are not in total denial. The continued rejection of the Kyoto Accord by the US is unacceptable particularly in light of recent scientific research within the US. Accordingly the position adopted by the US President is mind boggling.</P>
    <P>Similarly one cannot help being concerned about the latest Star Wars initiative which seems capable of fuelling another arms race, particularly in light of the ongoing instability within Russia. I can only hope that through a process of constructive engagement at a global level the new US Administration can take some of the hawks within.</P>
    <P>I look forward at the earliest possible opportunity of discussing with the Taoiseach the shape and composition which the forum on Europe should take so that we can meet the objectives stated publicly by him, which I share, so that it <Col N="1025" /> can be established during the summer months and can commence work in earnest in September.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I start by congratulating the Swedish Presidency for an excellent and successful Presidency. The Swedes set out three main objectives on employment, enlargement and the environment. They have been successful on all three. I am particularly pleased that they put sustainable development on the European agenda and this is on an equal footing with the objectives of full employment, having the most competitive economy and the most cohesive society in the world. These are very worthwhile objectives.</P>
      <P>I also deplore the organised violence by, what appears to be, a group of anarchists that now travel around the world to various events and summits. It was particularly unfortunate that this should happen in Sweden, which is renowned for its democracy and openness in how it does its business. It was not deserved by the Swedish people or Government.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, in all debates on Europe and in particular those held in Ireland, the social dimension to what is achieved in summits and treaties is always ignored. One of the features of the Nice debate was that the major steps forward made in Nice on the social agenda were ignored. It was the same with the Amsterdam treaty. In the past six months the achievements of Swedish Presidency included updating the 1976 Equal Treatment Directive; the extension of the Information and Consultation to Workers; the proposal in relation to a European co-operative society directive, which will parallel the European company statute directive that was approved just six months ago; and the economic sustainability issue, which is key to how Europe will evolve and develop in the future.</P>
      <P>The position of the Irish Greens and people like Deputy Joe Higgins, who are all absent from this debate, is always negative. I simply cannot understand why they ignore the advances that are made on behalf of the common people of this island and of Europe by the European Union treaties and summits.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the metaphor that springs to mind in relation to this Government's position on Europe is headless chickens. It is extraordinary that in the aftermath of what is in effect a watershed for Ireland's role in Europe that we have this cacophony of voices from the Government all pointing in different directions. That is legitimate in relation to a forum or a debate about what place we take in Europe, but in the immediate aftermath of Nice it sends clear signals to the people that those who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; were wrong and those who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; or stayed away from the polls were right. That is the unfortunate message being delivered by this divergence of views that has emerged from the Government in the aftermath of Nice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate that we are now having clearly demonstrates the left-right divide on Europe and its future. The Minister for Finance, Deputy <Col N="1026" /> McCreevy, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and more recently the Attorney General have clearly outlined their preference for the European economic and social model based on individualism. In the United States, they are quite happy to have that; that is their choice. The European choice has always been for the European social model based on solidarity. There is a clear debate emerging as between those two positions. That is a point at which we will divide. I do not know where other Ministers stand; perhaps in the course of the forum this will emerge. In my view there is a clear divide on how the key figures in Government believe Europe should evolve.</P>
    <P>At the weekend the Taoiseach signed up to the broad economic guidelines negotiated by the Minister for Finance two weeks ago. No sooner had the Minister for Finance negotiated the broad economic guidelines for 2002 than he announced that he would not comply with them. Will the Taoiseach insist that his Government Ministers, and in particular the Minister for Finance, comply with the guidelines that he has freely negotiated on behalf of this country with our partners in Europe? That is a fundamental question because we will face another crisis with Europe if the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, goes down the road he is currently signalling and the Taoiseach has an obligation to haul him in or sack him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address some of the external relations issues discussed at Gothenburg and perhaps comment on some other developments raised in the debate.</P>
      <P>The European Council issued a declaration on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in which it reaffirmed the necessity of a political solution in that troubled country while recalling the EU's strong attachment to the inviolability of borders and the sovereignty of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The EU reaffirmed the necessity of a political solution based on the opening of a true dialogue between all parties covering all issues, including key constitutional matters, and the establishment of a durable peace. President Trajkvoski has presented a plan for disarmament, which has been adopted by his government. This is a good basis for progress. It is imperative that the ceasefire is maintained and consolidated. The Prime Minister of FYROM is due to report on the progress of the political dialogue to the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg next Monday. I am aware of some developments in the interim since those Council conclusions were agreed and we will take up those very serious matters when the President comes to discuss those issues on Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Swedish Presidency's report on European security and defence policy covers both civilian and military aspects of crisis management. Five annexes are attached to the report, focusing largely on civilian crisis management issues. The report and annexes are generally favourable from <Col N="1027" /> Ireland's perspective. The report confirms that the development of European security and defence policy strengthens the Union's capacity to contribute to international peace and security in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter. The primary responsibility of the UN Security Council for the maintenance of peace and security is also well reflected.</P>
    <P>In this context, the European Council took note of the important steps, which have been taken to reinforce the political dialogue and strengthen co-operation between the EU and the UN. It was agreed that the EU-UN partnership should be further strengthened by ensuring that the Union's evolving military and civilian capabilities provide real added value for UN crisis management activities.</P>
    <P>Significant progress was also made at Gothenburg in the areas of civilian crisis management and conflict prevention. A Programme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts was approved.</P>
    <P>The European Council also noted developments in relations with NATO and with non-EU countries. Developments in these areas are in accordance with the important principles of the autonomy of decision making of both organisations and of non-discrimination against any State.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the EU-US Summit on Thursday 14 June included a statement on the Middle East, welcoming the Mitchell Report and urging both Israel and the Palestinians to implement the report's recommendations in all aspects, including ending the violence, taking confidence building measures and reviving negotiations. The Middle East was the main topic of discussion at the dinner held that evening between the EU Foreign Ministers and US Secretary of State, Colin Powell.</P>
    <P>The European Council itself gave full support to the Mitchell Report recommendations seeing its implementation by both sides as a window of opportunity. What is needed now is a continuing and effective commitment to the cessation of incitement and violence by both sides in the lifting of closures. It welcomed the recently agreed Palestinian-Israeli security implementation work plan. This requires effective commitment to bring about sustainable progress in the security situation and the lifting of closures. Importantly, the European Council called for the total freezing of settlements activity. A cooling off period should start as soon as possible to allow for the implementation of confidence building measures, leading to the resumption of full and meaningful negotiations for the final status agreement on the basis of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The European Council agreed with the view of the High Representative, as set out in his report to the Council, that rebuilding confidence needs urgent improvement of the situation on the ground, that rebuilding faith in peace needs EU support for the restoration of co-operation between civil societies and that aid to the Pales<Col N="1028" /> tinian institutions and economy remains a European commitment that we should maintain as part of the international effort to further the peace process in the region.</P>
    <P>On Algeria, the European Council called on all those responsible in Algeria to act to end the present confrontations and violence and called on the authorities to initiate a political initiative aimed at overcoming the crisis by means of a dialogue among all Algerians.</P>
    <P>On East Timor, the European Council expressed full support for the forthcoming elections for the constituent assembly and agreed that the EU would make a substantial contribution to the international monitoring of the elections.</P>
    <P>On the Korean peninsula, the European Council welcomed the result of the EU mission to the two Koreas, led by Prime Minister Persson. The inter-Korean dialogue and co-operation, non-proliferation and human rights will remain issues of vital importance for further progress in developing the EU-Korean relations.</P>
    <P>On Chechnya, the European Council agreed that a political solution to the conflict in Chechnya is urgently needed. Repeated violations of human rights have to be thoroughly investigated and perpetrators brought to trial. Russia has confirmed its readiness to co-operate with the EU in delivering humanitarian assistance programmes.</P>
    <P>On the media in Russia, the situation of the independent media in Russia concerns the EU as a strong civil society, freedom of speech and pluralism in the media are key components of a modern democratic society and are vital for a genuine EU-Russian partnership.</P>
    <P>On Kosovo, the European Council called on all parties to engage constructively in the implementation of the UN sponsored institutional framework for provisional self-government in Kosovo and to participate in elections scheduled for later this year.</P>
    <P>On non-proliferation, the European Council agreed that the EU would draw up a common position in the fight against ballistic missile proliferation based on the universalities of the international code of conduct proposed by Missile Control Technology Regime. This initiative could lead in time to the convening of an international conference.</P>
    <P>On EU-US relations, the Taoiseach spoke at the working dinner which took place between the Heads of State and Government and President Bush. The European Council meeting had been preceded by the regular summit meeting between the EU and the US where the Union, in line with established practice, was represented by the Presidency and the Commission. The Presidency reported that the meeting with President Bush took place in a very positive and friendly atmosphere and provided an ideal opportunity to reconfirm the essential values and shared objectives which are at the heart of the Europe's relations with the United States. As indicated in the European Council's conclusions, areas identified for further co-operation or joint foreign <Col N="1029" /> policy action include the Middle East, the Western Balkans and the Korean Peninsula.</P>
    <P>There was agreement that climate change was the most urgent challenge to be faced. The differences between the EU and the US with regard to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change were acknowledged, as was the need for continuing dialogue on this most important area.</P>
    <P>There was also agreement on the need for comprehensive action to combat AIDS and HIV and to facilitate the broadest possible provision of affordable drugs and on the need to launch a new inclusive round of global trade negotiations at the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation which is to take place in Qatar next November. The EU Foreign Ministers had an informal dinner with Secretary of State Colin Powell, which provided an opportunity to discuss areas of global concern, in particular the Western Balkans and the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Following the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg earlier last week, I had a series of bilateral meetings with Foreign Ministers of the candidate countries who were there for enlargement negotiations. The purpose of my meetings with the Foreign Ministers was to reassure the candidate countries that Ireland remained fully committed to the enlargement process. I pointed out that the referendum result should not be seen as a rejection by the Irish public of enlargement of the EU. I also told the Foreign Ministers that, despite our difficulties with the Nice treaty ratification process, Ireland would not be the cause of any delay in the negotiation and accession process. I conveyed a similar message to the ambassadors of these countries when I met them as a group in Dublin on 13 June. As the Taoiseach has already told the House, he also took the opportunity to reassure candidate prime ministers of Ireland's pro-enlargement policy in Gothenburg on Saturday, 16 June.</P>
    <P>In relation to some issues which were raised in the debate with regard to the enlargement question, the member states are unanimous in their view that the ratification process must continue on the basis of the text as agreed at Nice and in accordance with the agreed timetable. They made it clear that there could be no question of any reopening of the text agreed at Nice. The Gothenburg European Council confirmed these conclusions while restating a willingness to do everything possible to help Ireland resolve the difficulties which have arisen. Mutual respect cuts both ways. Just as we rightly expect respect for the outcome of our referendum, we must also respect the unanimous view of the other 14 member states, fully supported by the applicant states. They are unwavering in their conviction that the Treaty of Nice is required for enlargement.</P>
    <P>There has been an effort by some to use remarks by President Prodi to suggest that there is a contrary position in this regard. The unanimous and settled view of the member states is that enlargement can only proceed on the basis of the Treaty of Nice. There is no agreement &ndash;<Col N="1030" /> and no prospect of any agreement &ndash; to proceed on any other basis. That is the fact of the matter, and it will not be changed by reference to hypothetical, but entirely unreal, legal scenarios. I welcome the fact that President Prodi has indicated his concern at any construction placed on his remarks which would suggest otherwise. In his comments in Stockholm this morning, he has reiterated his view that the Treaty of Nice remains an imperative for enlargement. That is the factual position. He and the member states take this view because of the simple realisation that only by making the changes provided for in the treaty can an enlarged Union work in an acceptable manner.</P>
    <P>It is surely obvious to all that an effectively functioning Union is not only in Europe's interests but is a vital national interest. That is why the Government is determined to ensure, through the forum on Europe, that we have the kind of full-scale debate on these issues which the situation demands.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to some of Deputy Quinn's comments. I have already indicated on a number of occasions, even before the Treaty of Nice, that the Government is anxious to proceed with such a forum. The fact that the outcome of the referendum has been negative clearly indicates that the Treaty of Nice issues need to be addressed in that context. While I appreciate Deputy Quinn's sincerity in these matters, it does nobody any justice to get involved in labelling others. That is doing a great discredit to the complexity of this debate.</P>
    <P>A grave disservice is also done to people's understanding of our role in Europe when it is suggested that we are moving from a begging bowl mentality to some other kind of mentality. No Irish Government has had a begging bowl mentality towards Europe. What was agreed in the Delors Plans 1 and 2 was precisely the economic realisation that, in a Single Market with its own centrifugal economic force, it was necessary for peripheral regions to be given the economic, social and cohesion funds which would allow them to compete in that Single Market. That was not a begging bowl mentality. It does little service to the argument for supporters of the EU &ndash; the vast majority of people in this House and in the country &ndash; to suggest that we have been engaged on the basis of a handout mentality. It has been a hands-on mentality. Successive Governments since 1973 have used those funds and have taken on board the multi-annual programming approach sought by the EU Commission and the other institutions which we have allowed to be part of our planning and decision making process, strategically, economically and socially. That is what has enabled Ireland to take up the benefits which we derive from membership of the European Union.</P>
    <P>When we proceed to have the debate, I look forward to the substance and content of it bringing greater clarity to people's understanding of Ireland's present role in the EU, what the Treaty <Col N="1031" /> of Nice accession would mean if we agree to it and what the further post-Nice debate should be about. I put it to everybody in the House that we need to make sure that the substance and content of that debate will serve the purpose of public information. We must be conscious of the tone and tenor of what we have to say to others who may have a general overall agreeable view, but have a difference on detail. That should not dictate people's understanding of the issues as it has up to now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>On 3 April the Government approved the provision of a replacement contingent to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon comprising 559 personnel of the Permanent Defence Force for a six month period beginning on 30 April. This contingent will represent the final deployment of Defence Forces personnel to UNIFIL.</P>
      <P>On 23 May 2001, the UN informally inquired as to whether, in the context of withdrawal of the Irish contingent from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon in November of this year, Ireland would be willing to provide a guard and administration company of about 150 Defence Forces personnel for service with the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea with effect from December 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consultation with my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs informed the UN that, in the event of a formal request being <Col N="1032" /> received from the UN, the approval of the Government for the deployment of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNMEE for a period of 12 months from December 2001 would be sought. On 15 June 2001, the UN formally invited Ireland to contribute a guard and administration company of about 150 Defence Forces personnel to serve with UNMEE with effect from December 2001 for a minimum period of 12 months. Government approval will, accordingly, be sought at an early date for the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNMEE. Dáil approval for the despatch of the contingent will also be necessary.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that a military team will undertake a fact finding visit to Ethiopia and Eritrea at an early date when matters such as the precise role of the Defence Forces as well as the equipment required will be determined. A security assessment will also be carried out taking account of the situation on the ground at the time.</P>
    <P>In response to a separate request from the UN, I have agreed that two members of the Defence Forces will be deployed to the mission, with immediate effect, to take up staff appointments in UNMEE force headquarters. I have also agreed, at the UN's request, to the deployment of two officers of the Defence Forces, as military liaison officers, to the UN Peace Support Operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. These officers are expected to take up duty shortly.</P>
    <P>The total number of Defence Forces personnel currently serving overseas is 819. This number is subject to fluctuation in line with changes in mission strengths, repatriations, etc. Requests for personnel of the Defence Forces to serve on overseas missions are considered on their merits in the prevailing circumstances within the context of the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System to which Ireland has committed up to 850 members of the Defence Forces on UN service at any one time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister detail the tasks that will be undertaken by members of our Defence Forces in Ethiopia? Will he detail what other nations are currently, and will be participating in this mission when our Defence Forces go out there? Are outstanding funds due and payable to the State by the United Nations to be remitted to us in the context of our concluding our UNIFIL mission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The report on the fact finding mission to Ethiopia and Eritrea will establish the Defence Forces' precise role in the mission. However, present indications suggest that the Defence Forces will carry out,<i> inter alia,</i> the following tasks &ndash; provide signallers to operate the communications centre at the force headquarters; provide perimeter defence and internal security for UNMEE headquarters buildings; provide security for convoys and escort of key personnel <Col N="1033" /> and VIPs; provide transport services for headquarters' staff, food services for the force headquarters' staff, tactical mobile command posts, manning of military staff message centre and first line military police; give local assistance required for the second line military police and provide general administration support to force headquarters and whatever additional tasks arise from the report I will receive from the military team which will shortly go out there.</P>
      <P>From recollection, the outstanding amounts due from the UN to the Government are in the region of £8 million. There has been a substantial improvement in recent years, as the Deputy probably knows. The UN had its difficulties in making arrangements for its funding from the contributing countries. One cannot say it is perfect, but it is considerably better than it has been for a very long time. I do not know off-hand the names of all the existing contributing countries in Ethiopia and Eritrea. There are about 4,500 troops there. I will inform the Deputy of the precise names of the contributing countries at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the United Nations force in Ethiopia and Eritrea at present, what precisely is its mission and objectives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish contingent will conduct the tasks I have outlined. It is a peacekeeping mission to help to bring peace and normality and to allow the local community carry out their daily tasks in a normal secure situation. I hope the outcome to the United Nations' mandate in that area will be short-lived and will achieve those conditions and results as quickly as possible. What is envisaged here is a contingent for just one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline what size force will be left in Lebanon and what will happen when UNIFIL withdraws? Given our commitment of almost 150 personnel to Eritrea, will the Minister assure us that he will look for other overseas missions? If so, has he been approached with regard to supplying a force to any other area?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any plans to visit UNIFIL in Lebanon before it withdraws? Will he consider organising a trip for the next of kin of members who lost their lives there? Could a representative from each family be brought to visit the scene where their next of kin was killed or murdered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements are under way for my visit, which I will probably make towards the end of September. There are arrangements constantly being made for the families who lost their next of kin in South Lebanon to visit if and when they want to. These visits occur on a regular basis. Two or three have taken place in recent weeks. I will consider the question of families making further visits before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early last year, we indicated that by the end of 2001, we would conclude our work in South Lebanon as we completed the mandate that we <Col N="1034" /> set out to achieve. This was accepted by the United Nations. Recently the force has been continually reduced because the peace process has been effective and the Israelis have moved back to meet the terms of resolution 425. It is likely the United Nations will make a decision in July and that there will be some observer force in the region, with some military supports perhaps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the family visits to which he referred are taken at the families expense, and if so, will he look at the concept of State-sponsored visits? A sad legacy of our involvement in Lebanon was the disappearance of Private Kevin Joyce who went missing and was presumed dead in 1981. Have the Minister or other ambassadorial staff had any recent correspondence with members of the Palestinian organisation involved to make inquiries about the whereabouts of his remains? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The visits that are arranged for the families of soldiers killed in South Lebanon are funded by the Department of Defence. Similar arrangements will be made in the future. They have not been made only for immediate family members, but extended further in so far as that was possible. What was the second part of Deputy Timmins's question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>It related to Private Joyce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1981, despite an exhaustive check, we have not been able to recover the body of Private Joyce, and this remains a sad feature of the work of our troops in UNIFIL. In recent months, because we are reaching the end of our involvement in Lebanon, we have intensified our search in every way possible. We have established a special unit within the existing force. Links have been made with ambassadors, local mayors, and the Palestinian and Israeli authorities. Contacts were established and reports were made that raised our hopes, only to have them dashed again.</P>
      <P>About 21,000 people are missing is South Lebanon as a result of the war. We are doing everything we can, but we do not want to raise the hopes of the families unnecessarily, unless we have concrete and satisfactory information. Their hopes have been dashed so many times over the years. We dearly wish to solve the problem, but it is not solely in our hands. I assure the Deputy that every conceivable step that can be taken in terms of making contact with anybody who could help us is being undertaken with vigour and consistency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the conflict involving Israel, Palestine, and Lebanon, when we withdraw our UNIFIL troops from South Lebanon, what Irish troops will remain in the Middle East?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated, the United Nations in New York will take some decisions <Col N="1035" /> with regard to the requirements subsequent to our withdrawal. It is not likely that we will participate beyond this year. To answer Deputy Timmins's other question, we will concentrate in every way we can to look at the possibilities of serving in other areas where there is a need. It is unlikely that there will be any Irish personnel serving in South Lebanon beyond October 2001.</P>

      <Quest>the position of the Garda Síochána and the Army in relation to public order offences committed within army camps; if it is the Garda Síochána or the Army who have responsibility for dealing with such offences; the arrangements there are for co-ordination between the Garda Síochána and the Army; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am advised by the military authorities that they liaise as necessary with the Garda Síochána in relation to the application of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>The majority of military installations are enclosed by a perimeter fence or wall and members of the public are admitted only by permission. A public place, as defined in section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, would appear not to include most military installations. The Curragh Camp, however, is not enclosed by any perimeter fence or wall and members of the public regularly enter the camp for social, domestic or business purposes.</P>
      <P>The primary responsibility for security within the Curragh Camp rests with the general commanding officer and the Military Police unit is tasked to ensure security. The Military Police have limited powers of arrest under section 268 of the Defence Act, 1954, as amended. These powers of arrest are exercised from time to time with regard to persons present in the Curragh Camp without authority, and such persons are then handed over to the Garda Síochána to be dealt with by the civil courts.</P>
      <P>Following an incident in the Curragh Camp on 26 September 2000, during which a number of Military Police personnel were subjected to a serious assault, I am advised by the military authorities that additional security measures have been put in place to support the Military Police in the camp in the performance of their duties when required.</P>
      <P>The military authorities liaise constantly with the Garda in Newbridge and Kildare on incidents involving unruly or criminal activities in the Curragh Camp.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Is the Minister referring to visitors to the Curragh Camp, with no immediate connection to it, or families who currently reside in marital quarters or in Orchard Park? There are problems in the <Col N="1036" /> Curragh Camp concerning the public. This is where the narrow line lies between defining who looks after the camp. Who is the Garda responsible for and do the military authorities only look after persons resident in the camp?</P>
      <P>That is the narrow line about which there seems to be a problem. I talked to personnel in the camp and there seems to be a problem there that needs to be cleared up. The Minister is aware of the major work being done in the Curragh and this is only one of the problems that has arisen. If the problem could be cleared up, it would be to the benefit of everyone concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the role of the Military Police by and large is to deal with the personnel within the camp. Its members have limited powers of arrest of people outside that group and in such circumstances they would always seek the support of the Garda. I am, however, informed that that there has been a fairly significant improvement in the position in recent times since they have stepped up the security procedures. In the case of one individual, the court case has taken place and the individual has been sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Two others are awaiting trial which will take place in the next few months. There were more recent cases where suspended sentences were given. A consequence of the incidents that took place is that the overall security situation has improved and, fairly importantly, the culprits have been brought to justice.</P>

      <P>Having talked to some of the residents, I would appreciate if an increase in the involvement of the Garda, the Department and the Defence Forces in security there could be initiated. That needs to be ongoing. As the Minister has said many times here regarding the development there, we must make sure that the community is also involved rather than only ensuring that the armed forces get better facilities. We must link the two. I ask the Minister through his good offices to ensure every effort is made to align the involvement of the Garda and the military authorities.</P>

      <Quest>if suitable manoeuvre space for conventional mechanised unit level tactical training, that is, offensive or defensive tactical doctrine by battalion or battalion group size, is available on lands owned by the Department of Defence; the locations at which he proposes to conduct such training in advance of the Headline Goal 2003; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are extensive training areas available to the Defence Forces at the Glen of Imaal and Kilworth, County Cork, which meet most of their tactical training needs. The question of providing additional areas on an ad hoc basis for particular training needs in light of the acquisition of modern equipment is one that the military authorities are actively considering. I have not as yet received any proposals from them in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline to the Houses what training needs are not currently met by the locations that are available as detailed by him? Is he still committed to advancing the Headline Goal 2003 as envisaged in the context of the Rapid Reaction Force and our participating in a comprehensive and co-ordinated European approach to implementing the Petersberg Tasks? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am continuing in the strongest possible way to support the military authorities in their preparation to meet whatever requirements will arise from the Petersberg Tasks in peacekeeping, crisis management and humanitarian tasks. That has been one of the reasons we have become involved in a significant acquisition programme to place the Defence Forces in a position to have a more flexible approach to the type of missions that can be undertaken and to address the paramount concern of the safety and security of our personnel in these peacekeeping, humanitarian and crisis management tasks.</P>
      <P>From time to time the Defence Forces require additional space, that is land space. From the preliminary advice I have, it is not necessary that these lands would be owned by the Defence Forces on a long-term basis because some of their needs can be met by a temporary lease and the use of lands for short periods for the type of training exercises that cannot be met on our existing lands. We have 6,600 acres in the Glen of Imaal and it is probably one of the finest training areas one could find. It is used almost every day of the year for the various training that is going on.</P>
      <P>I am waiting for the military authorities to indicate to me what their additional requirements may be. The information I have is their requirements can be met without the need for large scale acquisition of land but by way of temporary leases. Additional space would be required for a specific time and then it may be required a year later or whenever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the Minister's repeated commitment to the work that is now <Col N="1038" /> being done in this area, can I take it that despite the outcome of the Nice referendum, the Government remains fully committed to our participating on a European basis in the European Rapid Reaction Force that is being put in place to deal with humanitarian tasks and peacekeeping and peace making, that the Government's commitment in that regard is as steadfast as it was prior to the Nice referendum, and that the work the Minister referred to will continue in co-operation with our Defence Forces?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is absolutely no change in Government policy in that regard. As I said during the week in McKee Barracks, in the poorest of times this country sent out troops to help restore peace and normality in different parts of the world. It would be strange in much better times if we were to renege on what is a fundamental part of our foreign policy. We normally go into an area after war and conflict. Everywhere we have gone we have been welcomed. We have never been the aggressor. We understand oppression and difficulties and are able to contribute in a significant way not only in a military capacity but in our attitude, approach, impartiality and acceptance to do that work, which we will continue to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of Government policy on this area, since the Nice referendum has the Minister consulted and sought the views of his Cabinet colleagues, such as, the Minister for Arts Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, to ascertain whether they have the same commitment as that which the Minister is voicing to the Rapid Reaction Force?</P>
      <P>In the context of the Minister's response, I draw to his attention that the Glen of Imaal and Kilworth are not suitable for mechanised training and he might indicate when he expects the Defence Forces to come back to him with proposals for alternative locations for the training that is envisaged in the context of our participating in this force and our troops having the training required to enable them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that the military authorities will report back to me fairly quickly, certainly within the next few months. They are engaged, as we are, from time to time in a search for suitable territory for training of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had no discussions with the colleagues mentioned by the Deputy. I assure him that the Government's policy is firm and has not been driven off course. The essential work we do in this area will be carried on. He need have no fears of any derailment in peacekeeping, humanitarian tasks and work of that kind as far as the Irish Defence Forces are concerned. Evidence of that has already been given today in terms of our immediate <Col N="1039" /> response to the United Nations request to us concerning Ethiopia and Eritrea.</P>

The precise area to be put on the market will be determined shortly but the military camp of 57 acres will not be disposed of.</P>
      <P>Casement Aerodrome is the principal base of the Air Corps. With the withdrawal of aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel, the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources.

      <P>The recommendations of the Crean report have been implemented. The Crean committee was established in 1979 in the aftermath of a tragic accident in the Glen of Imaal in which three children were killed and several others were injured. The committee examined safety measures at the glen and made recommendations on further safety precautions which were deemed necessary to minimise danger to the public arising from the use of the lands as an artillery range. The committee completed its deliberations in mid-1979.</P>
      <P>The main recommendations of the report included the erection of more appropriate warning signs, the fencing off of dangerous locations, the establishment of a safety unit and the ongoing monitoring of safety procedures in the glen. With regard to the latter, the military authorities have established a board to review the usage of the Glen of Imaal, including safety and security, to ensure procedures remain up to the standard required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister outlined all the recommendations. I understand there was a recommendation that the notices should be more user friendly and easily understood. One of the difficulties at present is that people from outside Wicklow who visit the glen see the large red warning signs and red flags posted at various entrances to the range area but the range might be located several miles away, particularly in the Glenmalure area. The notices warn that one is now entering a military area and one should keep out when the flag is flying. I was there a few weeks ago and noticed that cars turned back on seeing the signs. They are confused by them. Will the Minister consider posting more user friendly signs at certain strategic locations? The signs could include maps of the area and an explanatory notice rather than the formal notice currently used. I appreciate the signs must remain but they could be more user friendly.</P>

It must be graphic, given the serious accident which took place in 1979 and the fact that there is unexploded ordnance in the area. Leaflets have been published and distributed to all the homes, schools and the warden offices but I will examine the matter again. It is an important range for the Defence Forces but it is also important that parts of it remain an amenity for the public. I am not sure what more can be done but we will see if there is a better way to deal with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 61, 95 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises that there are urgent equipment modernisation requirements in the Air Corps. In recognition of these requirements, I announced on I March of last year the allocation of a total of £55 million over the next three years for this purpose. These funds will initiate vital investment in new aircraft for the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>The first indicator of this investment is the current project for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport. The tender competition for the provision of medium lift helicopters is well advanced and it is expected the Department will be in a position to place a contract later this year.</P>
      <P>There are other equipment requirements in the Air Corps. In this regard, I am still awaiting the submission of a strategic plan for the organisation which is to be presented by the military authorities. This plan is to include recommendations on a complete fleet replacement programme in order of priority.</P>
      <P>One such priority is the requirement to acquire fixed wing training aircraft for Air Corps cadets and officers. When proposals for fixed wing training aircraft are received in tandem with the strategic plan, I will arrange for my Department to progress the matter as one of urgency. This will address the issue of the lack of suitable aircraft for training cadets and will permit the effective and efficient training of Air Corps flying officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> There are other methods of training pilots in place at present to deal with any perceived lack of flying hours on aircraft. Simulators are used in addition to the provision of training courses abroad. Recent developments include eight flying officers undergoing an intensive fixed wing instructor's course in Canada in June and July 2001. Two rotary wing pilots are due to attend a training course in Canada later this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister acknowledge that the current provision for the training of members of the Air Corps is completely inadequate and will he indicate to the House when he expects the new fixed wing training aircraft to become available to the Air Corps? Is there a time frame within which they can be expected? What is the date envisaged for the receipt of the helicopters by the Air Corps which are the subject of the tender currently being considered by the Minister and his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four companies involved: Sikorsky of the USA, EH Industries of England, Eurocopter of France and CHC Scotia of Scotland. It would be impossible to give a time frame but when I have a successful tender, I intend to enter into negotiations with that company on the basis of what facilities could be afforded in the interim. As Deputy Shatter will be aware from his own experience, there are no aircraft lying idle waiting to be purchased. An aircraft is prescribed and then built to meet the requirements of the country's air corps or defence force. It is important that we try to find a way to bridge some of the gap but I can only do that when I am dealing with the company which has won the tender. I want to see what interim measures could be introduced to help the training because we would not make these funds available unless we accept, as we all do here, that there is a real need to upgrade the aircraft.</P>
      <P>I am trying to achieve in this area of equipment, both for the Naval Service and for the Defence Forces, what has been achieved across the Defences Forces generally in the areas of recruitment and of accommodation. We want to achieve a rising equipment graph&mdash;</P>

I would like to be able to give the Deputy a time frame and I like to work to time frames, but until such time as a company wins the tender it would be wrong for me to be too specific. However, I am putting as much pressure as possible on everyone involved, first, in the case of purchasing aircraft this year where we will place a contract, and then with the military to get their proposals as to the ongoing requirements. I am doing so to ensure that, with the financial envelop available to me and the proceeds of sales of property I am proposing, the funds will be there to meet the purchase of equipment on that rising graph basis.</P>

      <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister that we are seeking overseas training. I suggested this at Question Time previously. The exchange of views and the training will only do the pilots good.</P>
      <P>Is there still a haemorrhaging of pilots leaving the Air Corps or what is the current position in that regard? Does the Minister see the advent of the purchase of the new aircraft and helicopters as a means of retaining the pilots due to the excitement which will be generated by the knowledge that these will be made available to the Defence Forces? Does he see that as a way of retaining some of the pilots who heretofore we lost to the private sector?</P>

      <P>I accept that about a year and a half ago Deputy Wall suggested here that we use facilities abroad to train pilots. No doubt, accommodation, the environment and equipment are important factors in a person determining his or her ability to remain and develop a career, and we are improving those. There is a continual drain. The growth in civil aviation has been phenomenal. The opportunities in these areas are at a level and at a rate which do not make it easy for State organisations to compete. We have done the best we can in terms of introducing schemes to encourage pilots to remain in the Air Corps but it is a constant struggle and challenge. Undoubtedly the provision of better aircraft should be at least one instrument in helping to slow down that exodus.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 41, 42, 55, 77, 93 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Ballincollig, Naas, Kildare, Castleblayney and Clancy Barracks, Dublin. Five of the barracks have been vacated while the sixth &ndash; Clancy Barracks &ndash; will be evacuated this year.</P>
      <P>Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, is in the process of being sold to Cork County Council for economic development of the site in conjunction with the IDA. The agreed price is £767,000 and it is hoped the formalities of this sale can be completed in the very near future. The lands will be developed and marketed as a strategic industrial site to attract inward investment. This development will greatly assist in the continuing revitalisation of Fermoy and will greatly enhance its potential for future industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. I agreed to cede seven acres free of charge <Col N="1046" /> to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for £300,000, all for local community purposes. I have also agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas UDC for £7 million. The legal formalities to give effect to these agreements are progressing and I expect them to be completed very shortly.</P>
    <P>The Castleblayney property is in the process of being sold to the North Eastern Health Board for £600,000 and sale contracts have recently been signed. Pending completion of the legal and financial formalities, a caretaker's agreement was completed and the former barracks was handed over to the health board last year on foot of that agreement. The legal formalities to complete the sale are progressing.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the child care project by the health board for the site will provide for 45 permanent appointments and a sum in excess of £1 million will be invested on the provision of the necessary facilities. In addition, the annual revenue to the town is estimated to be in the region of £1.2 million. The proposal from the NEHB includes a gymnasium, an all-weather pitch and a swimming pool. I understand these facilities will be made available to the local community when not in use for child care purposes.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive integrated action area plan was commissioned from independent consultants to provide for the future development of the largest of the barracks concerned, Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig. That plan provides for a wide range of community, amenity, residential and commercial uses for the property. The development of the Murphy Barracks lands will be critical in the future overall development of the town of Ballincollig. My Department submitted the integrated plan to Cork County Council in April 2000, for consideration in the context of a variation to the existing Cork county development plan. Discussions are ongoing between Cork County Council and my Department to determine the best way forward to realise the potential of the integrated plan, while taking account of the aspirations of all sides. It is hoped to bring the matter to conclusion at an early date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the need for accommodation, the vacated Magee Barracks, Kildare, is now providing accommodation for asylum seekers. I have also agreed to provide one acre to the local authority for a temporary halting site for 20 persons for a period of one year. In view of those needs, it has not been possible to arrange for the disposal of the property. However, this matter is being kept under review.</P>
    <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, will be evacuated in the near future when alternative accommodation becomes available. My Department, following a tender competition, has appointed selling agents, Hamilton Osborne King. The barracks of 13.65 acres was offered for sale by public tender. Bids were received for the purchase of the barracks on 14 June and are currently being considered.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing properties, agree<Col N="1047" /> ments have also been reached for the sale of the following: 1.07 acres at Arbour Hill to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for £2.5 million; 6.39 acres known as Susan's Field, adjoining Collies Barracks, Cork, to Cork Corporation for £1.2 million; 3.0192 acres at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, to Limerick Corporation for £915,000; 1.559 acres at Waterford Barracks to Waterford Corporation for £550,000; 20 acres of the Curragh lands to Kildare County Council for £215,000 to assist with the construction of the Kildare by-pass; and married quarters at Orchard Park, Curragh, County Kildare to residents, which will realise £3 million approximately. The disposal of ten acres at Mellows Field beside Renmore Barracks, Galway, will proceed as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>I have also decided to sell approximately 150 acres at Gormanston camp. However, the military camp of 57 acres will not be sold. It is too early to estimate the likely proceeds from this sale as the preliminary planning is still in progress. As can be seen, many of the properties are destined for disposal to local authorities in recognition of the increased needs for building lands being experienced by them. A number of smaller surplus properties are also being sold to various individuals at present.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing properties which are surplus to requirements and in the context of the White Paper on Defence and the management of resources in the best possible way, the military authorities have been asked to identify any additional properties considered surplus to requirements. This process is ongoing. As indicated, the disposal of barracks is proceeding and it is expected that up to £100 million will be realised from the sale of the properties. The moneys raised from the sale of the six barracks earmarked for disposal in 1998, and those additional surplus properties since identified, will be used primarily for re-equipment and refurbishment within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>With regard to the disposal of equipment, the military authorities from time to time establish boards of survey to determine when certain items are obsolete and due to be reduced to scrap. The scrap material is then sold by way of sealed tender competition. Running contracts for the disposal of such equipment are normally placed for periods of 12 to 18 months duration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate on the Defence Estimates I raised a question regarding Magee Barracks, County Kildare. The local authority area committee is undertaking a development plan for Kildare town. The Minister accepts it is of vital importance to the town that a determination be made regarding the barracks apart from what has been decided in terms of asylum seekers and the halting site. Will he impress on his Department and the local authority the need for progress this issue, including making a decision on the acquisition of the land by the local authority and the <Col N="1048" /> plans by the Department for its sale to ensure the development plan for the town can proceed? If the overall development for the town is to be completed, a pivotal part must include these lands. The Minister accepts that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Located as they are in the centre of Kildare town, these lands are critical for the proper development of the town and I am anxious to proceed. When we discussed this before I indicated to the Deputy that I started from the premise of wanting to deal with this on the basis of an integrated action plan. That had to be deferred because of the way the site was being used for purposes for which we did not originally envisage. I have now concluded that there is a need to consider seriously the remaining part of the site and to commence negotiations on that aspect. I will ensure that in the near future meetings take place with regard to an examination of the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Clancy Barracks, will the Minister detail the nature of the discussion that took place between him, his Department and Dublin Corporation concerning the possibility of releasing some of the lands to Dublin Corporation to facilitate it in tackling the housing crisis in the city? Will he indicate why, as a consequence of those negotiations, no lands were ceded to Dublin Corporation? Why is it the case that in or about the time the lands in the barracks were advertised on the market the Dublin city manager expressed disappointment at the out-turn of events?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>From all of my dealings with the local authorities, community interests and State agencies, it will be clear that I was very much engaged in trying to ensure the community needs of each of the towns involved in the disposal of lands were met. In the case of Clancy Barracks the story was no different. We immediately became involved in negotiations regarding its sale with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and Dublin Corporation. The early indications were that the corporation was very interested in the site. I was happy with that arrangement but subsequently, after approximately 12 months, we were informed that its interest had waned and it expressed the view that the site could be best dealt with through a public sale involving commercial interests with perhaps a housing element. The site was then put up for sale and we have received bids which are under consideration.</P>
      <P>I am still open to the corporation purchasing the barracks at a reasonable price. Instead of repeating the arrangement I made in other small towns, I will take account of the position of the site in the price because it does not present itself as suitable for part disposal in this way. However, I will take account of the corporation's interest in the overall value of the property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister detail the involvement of the Department of the Environment and Local Government? Was specific funding sought by Dublin Corporation from the Department to facilitate the acquisition of Clancy Barracks or a part of the lands comprising the barracks? Did difficulties arise between the Department and Dublin Corporation in meeting the financial requirements of the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not reach that stage because, as the Deputy is aware, I am obliged to obtain valuation for all public properties through the Valuation Office, which was done in this case. I cannot be certain about this but it appears there was no application for special funds for this purpose by the corporation to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. It did not reach the stage of the corporation making a bid for the property. We indicated the value placed on the property but prior to the current sale the corporation was never in a position to make a bid, so it did not proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Corporation could not have made a bid without the provision of funding by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Is the Minister saying that if the Department provided necessary funding to acquire Clancy Barracks to Dublin Corporation it is still open to the corporation to proceed on that basis with a view to providing housing accommodation at that location in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated many times, my door is open for that to happen. It appears the corporation has decided it has no serious interest in the site.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that 100% of the funding received from these sales will be reinvested in the Defence Forces? If that happens, although the granting of seven acres to Naas Urban District Council and Kildare County Council may be a noble act, it will ultimately result in a loss of approximately £3 million to the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unusual for Opposition parties to take both sides of an issue at the same time. We did it ourselves in the past and I am not complaining. However, the Defence Forces would want me to deal comprehensively, conclusively and generously with the communities in which they served and worked and are now leaving. That is being done. We are trying to get the best possible value in the circumstances and make provision for the community, local authority or public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be regrettable, given his vast experience in the Defence Forces, if Deputy Timmins stayed in the fair until 7 p.m. until he got the last penny from the farmer who could not even afford to have a cup of tea or bowl of soup during the day. We are addressing both ends of the matter. <Col N="1050" /> The Defence Forces would want the Department to ensure they leave a good taste in the areas they are vacating and that our actions continue to serve the community rather than adopt an attitude that we have lost because seven acres have been ceded. We have not lost anything.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>the extent to which pay and conditions in the Defence Forces compare to other European Union member states; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18269/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A wide range of different rates of pay for military personnel can be found across the EU. This reflects the enormous differences in development levels and labour market conditions between member states. The differing rates are also influenced by such matters as the conditions of entry, terms of service, workloads, taskings, superannuation provisions and the taxation and social welfare regimes that apply in the various EU countries. In addition, the nature of national defence organisations is varied.</P>
      <P>Members of the Irish Permanent Defence Force are better paid than members of defence forces in some EU member states. Equally, they are paid less than the members of defence forces in some other EU countries. In some instances, a country may pay a certain category of service personnel a higher rate than the Irish equivalent, while paying others a lower rate than that obtaining in Ireland. Rates of remuneration and conditions of employment in the Irish public sector are never set by reference to those obtaining in another EU member state. What is much more relevant in this context is a comparison of the relative levels of pay across the various sectors of the Irish public sector. In this regard, in general, the level of remuneration in the defence sector has maintained relativity with the levels available in other public sector employments.</P>
      <P>In signing up to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, both of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations also agreed to participate in the first ever public service benchmarking process. In their recent submissions to the benchmarking body, neither of the associations felt it relevant to draw on pay comparisons with defence forces in other EU member states, although they validly referred to the various methodologies and mechanisms used in other countries to calculate defence forces' pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benchmarking process is a genuine attempt to set pay levels for the Irish public service in the context of the Irish economy and not the economy of any other EU country. Benchmarking is an open, independent and progressive way of tackling the setting of appropriate pay levels and the process is providing the Defence Forces representative associations with an opportunity to present their cases in relation to their members' pay levels. Only by operating within <Col N="1051" /> the framework of national programmes like the PPF and using the benchmarking process can we continue to make economic and social progress in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>When the benchmarking process began, it was envisaged that the bulk of the work would be concluded and recommendations would be made by the middle or end of 2002. It has proved to be exhaustive work. The associations have done a considerable amount of work in this regard and that information will go into the pool for consideration. It is likely that decisions will be reached by the middle of next year, but definitely by the end of 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister speed up the process? Will he acknowledge that there is now considerable difficulty recruiting new members of the Defence Forces and that the reason for this difficulty is that the pay received by members of the Defence Forces is at variance with what can be received in civilian life by many of those who are currently members of the Defence Forces? Does he acknowledge that there will be ongoing difficulty in recruiting new people to the Defence Forces until the pay structure is modernised? In that context, will the Minister consider speeding up the timeframe for the completion of the benchmarking process with regard to members of the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most anxious to facilitate this work in every possible way. On the basis of the figures in other countries, the Defences Forces do better than most countries and not as well as others in terms of pay. There are many variations. There is a special superannuation pension scheme for members of the Defence Forces which is extremely attractive. However, the benchmarking process provides an opportunity to conclude the work on the comparison between employment in the private and public sectors. Considerations must be taken into account in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty with regard to recruitment does not relate only to pay. It also relates to competition for people that did not exist up to now. Consideration is being given to changing some of the recruitment programmes to take further account of the stresses that exist due to competition in the workplace and the low unemployment rate. It is a major challenge and everything possible will be done to speed up a successful outcome to the benchmarking process. It is important to maintain numbers and recruit young <Col N="1052" /> blood to enable the Defence Forces develop in the future.</P>

      <P>The building of a second new ship for the Naval Service by Appledore Shipbuilders Limited in England is almost complete. The ship, to be named the <i>LE Niamh</i>, is a replacement for the <i>LE Deirdre </i>which has reached the end of its economic life and has been decommissioned.</P>
      <P>During &ldquo;builders&rdquo; sea trials, which take place in advance of customer acceptance sea trials, a problem arose with the port gearbox on the ship. Subsequent examinations indicated that there was also a problem with the starboard gearbox on the ship. The contractual issues in regard to both gearboxes are being addressed by Appledore Shipbuilders Limited with the manufacturer of the gearboxes, Scana Volda of Norway. My Department and the Naval Service are in daily contact with Appledore Shipbuilders Limited on developments in this regard.</P>
      <P>When both gearboxes are reinstated and re-commissioned, the ship will undergo customer acceptance sea trials, which will be attended by representatives of the Department of Defence and the Naval Service. These sea trials are now scheduled for the second week of July 2001. When these trials are completed, and if everything goes well, the ship will be officially handed over to the Department. The ship will then sail to Haulbowline and will enter operational service as soon as possible thereafter. The ship was originally scheduled for delivery in September 2001.</P>

      <P>I hope so. It is still two months before the original scheduled date of delivery. <Col N="1053" /> Training is ongoing. There are no problems in that regard and, of course, the <i>LE Róisín </i>is already there.</P>
      <P>There are no financial ramifications to this problem. It is primarily a matter for the ship builders themselves and the agents from Norway who build the gear boxes. In the sea trials, our task will be to make sure everything is satisfactory. We are looking for a longer guarantee than we would normally seek for this aspect of the ship, arising from the difficulty which has arisen. However, there are no financial implications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 13 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>On 2 March 2001, arising from the foot and mouth emergency, the Defence Forces were asked to supply a number of troops to aid the civil authority. These troops, operating on an unarmed basis, supported the activities of Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development officials with assistance from the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the days following that request, my Department was contacted by two of the three Defence Forces representative organisations. On 5 March a claim for &ldquo;an allowance equivalent to maintenance of essential service allowance&rdquo; was submitted by PDFORRA, the representative association for Defence Forces enlisted personnel. This claim was processed through the conciliation and arbitration system in the normal way and a meeting <Col N="1054" /> of the conciliation council to consider this claim took place on 14 March 2001. On 28 March 2001 following some negotiations, an offer of an allowance of £35 per extended duty was made to PDFORRA. The association will formally accept this offer at the next meeting of the conciliation council which is scheduled to take place on 5 July next.</P>
    <P>On 13 March 2001, the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, wrote to my Department seeking an assurance that any reservists mobilised to assist in the foot and mouth prevention measures would receive the same rates of pay and allowances as members of the Permanent Defence Force. The militarty authorities advised that members of the reserve would not be called upon unless the foot and mouth situation disimproved significantly. It was agreed that the questions regarding pay and allowances could be looked at if and when the use of reserve personnel arose. On 2 May last my Department wrote to RDFRA to advise it formally of the situation. There was no request or necessity to arrange a meeting with RDFRA on this issue.</P>
    <P>No claim for payment of any allowance in respect of this operation has been received from RACO, the commissioned officers' representative assocation, although a number of meetings have taken place with representatives of that association in the intervening period. I understand that a small number of commissioned officers might have been directly involved in the operation and I would be quite willing to offer an allowance to them on a similar basis to that negotiated with PDFORRA.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I acknowledge the vital contribution the Defence Forces made to the national effort to curb the spread of foot and mouth disease in Ireland. I am sure I speak for everybody in this House when I say that once again our Defence Forces have earned our respect and thanks for their efficient and committeed efforts on behalf of all of us.</P>

      <P>Discussions took place between my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General in <Col N="1056" /> the context of last November's decision by the Government to authorise commitment by Ireland of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces to the EU headline goal. The advice at that time was that Ireland's political commitment to the EU headline goal did not give rise to any requirement to amend existing legislation. This remains the position.</P>
      <P>As regards any potential EU Petersberg Tasks operation, I reiterate the policy of the Government that Ireland will approach each mission on a case by case basis and only participate in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960 and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993.

Can he indicate to the House whether he envisages members of the Defence Forces engaging, in the future, in joint training exercises with other European Union states' defence forces which participate in the rapid reaction force? Does he envisage such training taking place outside Ireland? Has he considered whether or not there is a need for new legislation to ensure that where such training exercises take place there are no legal difficulties in their doing so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has decided to commit forces to the rapid reaction force which will carry out peacekeeping, humanitarian and crisis management tasks for the European Union. We will only operate under existing legislation under mandate from the UN. It is too early to translate what is involved into whether the necessity will arise for training exercises to be conducted abroad. If a request were to come for that to happen we might have to look at the legislative situation. The advice of the Attorney General, which I feel will be maintained, is that because of the strict nature of where Ireland stands in these matters &ndash; on the UN peacekeeping mandate and under our own Defence Acts &ndash; it is not likely there will be any change. Nevertheless some things must be continually checked, depending on the momentum at the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to look at peacekeeping and crisis management in a wider context. Deputies well appreciate the policing character of <Col N="1057" /> it and know that members of the Garda have gone to various places. Democratisation, local authority, systems of planning, provision of services and charges and general management seem to have been lost sight of in the past. We need to take account of the wider needs of people. We create dependency if we do not empower people to master their destiny subsequent to the withdrawal of troops. The mechanism must be of a wider character. It must contain a military component as well as civil, policing, judicial and other services. We must look at the broader picture of what is needed to help communities who are experiencing strife.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking the last day we discussed this matter I intended to make a general point about the confusion that surrounded the debate here and the manner in which it had been unhelpfully portrayed by members of the European Commission. The speech made last night by Commissioner Prodi illustrates the gulf that now exists between the members of the European Commission and the citizens of the Union. The Commission President's speech as reported was unwelcome. It was an affront to every Member of this House and to the leadership of all the major political parties who campaigned in the Nice referendum on the basis that the Treaty of Nice was fundamentally important in terms of the enlargement of the Community. Now it seems Mr. Prodi and his friends have taken an alternative view. The Commission President and some of his colleagues may wish to ignore the views of the Irish people on the Nice treaty but we cannot and should not.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset of the debate, I am firmly committed to the idea of European integration. I believe the European Union and its predecessors, the EC and the ECSC, provided the framework within which Europe could grow, prosper and develop in the post war years. Above all else, the European Community and its predecessors gave us peace. That is not the issue. What is in question is the capacity of the European Commission, and more particularly its President, to understand that it is sovereign, independent nation states that make up the European Union. The level of sovereignty that the independent states have freely chosen to surrender in the process of building the new Union and the new Europe is strictly a matter for law and the states themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this sovereign independent nation the basic, fundamental law is the Constitution which the Irish people adopted in 1937. They are the sole masters of that Constitution and are the only ones with the sovereign power to change it. So far as the Nice Treaty is concerned, the Irish people have spoken and, like it or lump it, the Commission and its President have no option but to accept it. They should do so with more good grace than they have shown in the recent past. Any attempt to move forward in Europe within <Col N="1059" /> the Nice process without formal Irish ratification would be illegal under European law and subject to challenge in either domestic courts or in the European Court. It is my contention that the suggestion from the Commission in recent weeks that we can somehow ignore the Nice referendum is based on an <i>ultra vires</i> view. If Commissioner Prodi and his commissioners choose to ignore that they will do so at their peril.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time that the Commission President has put his two feet into it, metaphorically speaking, so far as Ireland is concerned. Earlier this year we had the attack by the European Commission on the Irish budget. That rang alarm bells in the minds of many Irish taxpayers. At the time, I pointed out that intervention would undoubtedly have a significant impact on the Nice ratification process. That is undoubtedly what happened. It was significant in the eyes of people when making up their minds on how to vote in the recent referendum. The Irish are not prepared to surrender taxation sovereignty to a Europe dominated by left-wing Governments who in many cases are ideologically committed to high tax and high spend policies. It is extraordinary in the past 48 hours to hear Commissioner Prodi again refer to issues relating to taxation. High tax, high spend policies may well be suitable for certain member states. That is a matter for their parliaments. The only body constitutionally charged with raising taxes in this country is Dáil Éireann and that is not the view of this House. While I support the idea of European integration, taxation is not a power that I would wish to see conceded to a non-elected largely left-wing group of commissioners sitting in Brussels. The reality is there is a dangerous gulf growing between the people of Europe and the bureaucrats who people the institutions of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Nice treaty, no matter what its good intentions, is a document that has been democratically tested in only one member state, and that is Ireland. It failed to meet the democratic test in this nation. It is an arrogance for any politician, either here or any commissioner in Europe, to ignore the fundamental fact that the Irish people have spoken with some clarity on the matter. Yet, last night the President of the European Commission suggested that somehow or other the Irish people's will can be undone. If the Commission, its leaders or the Governments of other European states decide to sweep democracy aside, we must ask on what basis is the future of Europe to be built.</P>
    <P>A core issue that Schümann, Monet, De Gasperi and all the architects of modern Europe sought to enshrine and reflect in its institutions was democracy. That is fundamental. If we look at their early speeches we will see that was one of the issues that bound them together. There can be no doubt that there is a growing and dangerous democratic deficit in Europe. The views of the Irish people reflected the discontent that is widescale across the continent of Europe. There <Col N="1060" /> were a series of issues in the referendum other than that but it was a centre and core issue.</P>
    <P>Over the past two days, I attended a meeting of the interim European Security and Defence Assembly. I was amazed and gratified in equal measure at the response by European parliamentarians from 28 different European nations to the Irish referendum. It was an interesting one and an extraordinary eye-opener. There was no finger-wagging or suggestion that the people had got it wrong or were confused, rather there was a degree of admiration for the decision the Irish had made. Speakers from the United Kingdom to Slovenia to Greece spoke on the issue. They indicated their support for the right of the Irish people to make a decision on this matter. They were by no means all Euro sceptics. Speakers from a number of countries both within and outside the Union indicated that the Irish people in their vote reflected a common view and concern that now exists both within the EU and in those states most proximate to the EU. Members from the EU states who contributed directly in the debate or who spoke privately to the Irish delegation members indicated that it was their view &ndash; I made an effort to do a straw poll &ndash; that referenda on the Nice treaty as it currently stands, if held in other member states, would meet with the same public response as in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is something distinctly odd about democratic states attempting to take decisions that are out of line with the sentiment of their citizens. The gulf that exists between the citizens of Europe and the institutions, the commissioners and the bureaucrats who are now driving the Union is no more visible than in the area of peace, security and defence. In the run up to the Nice treaty the European Council decided, quite incredibly, that somehow the European Union could now take charge of peace, security and defence issues across the continent of Europe within and outside the Union.</P>
    <P>Last month in the Hague the chairman of the European Parliament defence committee, Mr. Brok, made an absolute ass of himself by suggesting that the European Parliament with all its warts, which is made up of members of only 15 European states, somehow provides democratic oversight for the entire continent of Europe. When he was asked by some people from the eastern European states if they too were not Europeans, he failed to give a coherent answer. The best he could do was indicate a state of confusion. This response to valid questions, coming from the chairperson of the defence committee of the European Parliament, is all too familiar. It indicates the arrogance which exists at institutional level in the European Union. This week in Paris during one of the debates an eastern European parliamentarian asked the incoming presidency if he too was not European. He did not receive an answer.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by the rejection of the Nice treaty in the referendum are of a fundamental <Col N="1061" /> nature. I have listened with some dismay to today's debate and the debate that has taken place in the weeks since the referendum. Many in the political leadership of the nation are more focused on making a political point about the referendum than on truly addressing the core issues behind the judgment passed by the people.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the Nice treaty process is dead and will not be revived until the people decide in another referendum to reverse the decision they made on 9 June. It is foolhardy to talk about another referendum at this stage unless something fundamental changes. To attempt to rerun a referendum as a means of reversing the democratic decision taken by the people would be rightly regarded as an affront. Something fundamental will have to be changed in the Nice treaty before we can even contemplate putting it before the people again.</P>
    <P>The Nice treaty is a complex document which intends to achieve complex things. It was sold to the Irish people as a means of providing for the enlargement of the European Union. Last night Mr. Prodi made it very clear that was not what the treaty is about. He did not, however, make clear precisely what it is about. He was saying, therefore, that the enlargement process could be somehow achieved without the Nice treaty. I doubt that is the case. It can be achieved for possibly four states. As someone else said today, I would not like to be the person who tells the other states they may not join.</P>
    <P>This raises the question of what exactly Nice is about. One of the most distinguished predecessors of the current President of the European Union has suggested the European Union puts the Nice treaty to one side and reconsiders the entire manner in which the EU is attempting to move forward. Mr. Delors has, I suspect, a better sense of history than Mr. Prodi. In 1954 it looked as though the entire process of European integration would grind to a halt when it had barely started. Members with a sense of history will remember the French Assembly rejected by a narrow vote the EDC and EPC proposals. By the oddest coincidence of history, that treaty, which was to serve as the template for the new Europe, was defeated by roughly speaking the same margin as the Nice treaty in the referendum. The irony of the vote in the French Assembly was that France put forward the proposals for the EDC and EPC.</P>
    <P>Thankfully Mr. Prodi was not in charge at the time. The leadership of Europe did not engage in hysterical recriminations against the French Assembly or the French people. Rather, it considered the real issues involved in the rejection of the treaty. The main issue was that Europe was trying to bite off too much at once. The process was too complex. It was an attempt to take a gargantuan leap forward when a step by step approach would have been more prudent. After a period of reflection and contemplation, the relance of Europe was achieved following the <Col N="1062" /> Messina conference. It resulted in the Treaty of Rome, from which Europe emerged stronger.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the assembly I attended yesterday and the considerable interest shown in the decision of the Irish people. Some thought provoking contributors indicated that the opportunity afforded the Irish people should also be offered to the citizens of other member states. Maybe then Europe would get a clear message about what the people of Europe expect in the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to comment on the Nice treaty and the referendum. I recommended a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote during the campaign having taken cognisance of a number of different factors which were unsatisfactory both in the negotiating procedure and the final text of the treaty itself. However the treaty as finished and negotiated was to be put before the people so one had to choose whether to recommend a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote or &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote. I recommended a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote because I believed, from my contacts and counsel in Europe's parliamentary assembly and elsewhere, that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote would be perceived by the applicant countries as a message that they were welcome and that a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote could be construed, whether true or not, as a rejection of enlargement.</P>
      <P>For that reason I recommended clearly and unequivocally a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote. My decision was taken on balance. I also had reasons which were particular to my approach to the campaign. I felt, again from conversations with many different strands of opinion in the applicant countries, that our decision would have an effect on the kind of transition under way in the applicant countries from state led economic systems to a version of the mixed model of the economy and new forms of institutional structure in civil society. That transition would be affected by globalisation which would make itself manifest in one of two models, either an unregulated neo-liberal market model driven by the United States or a model of transition that includes social protection, the model that lies at the heart of social Europe. Put simply, I concluded that workers, citizens and those reliant on income from different forms of social welfare, such as pensioners, needed the social model quickly and, if possible, within the time frame contained in the treaty that was put before the people. The quicker they were part of the social model, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also looked at what had happened to some of the state properties in these countries shortly after the demolition of state control. For example, in the Czech Republic a system of credits issued to the citizenry in general was accumulated for hard currency by many expatriates who had moved back to the Czech Republic and now owned vast amounts of what was previously the property of the public. Examples of this include a whole side of the main street in Prague, in other words, predators were unrestrained, putting their claws on the people's property. The quicker these <Col N="1063" /> applicant countries were in the European Union, the better protection there would be. I am not saying that any of those who lined up in favour of a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote shared that view but it is important to state it.</P>
    <P>The behaviour in my constituency during the campaign of Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuiv, was unconscionable. To participate in a public campaign seeking a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote and then to announce when the result had gone the other way that one had voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; and proceed to give long interviews about what were referred to in one Mayo newspaper as &ldquo;scary moments&rdquo; that he shared with his cousin, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, is not an act of integrity. It is shameful, an exercise in bad faith that is corrosive of trust. A reasonable person is entitled to ask politicians knocking their door in the future if they are just going through the motions for the party or how their heart really ticks or if they will vote the same way as they are asking other people to vote. That degree of bad faith destroys the trust that is at the basis of politics.</P>
    <P>I concur with Deputy Roche on my next point. The people have spoken. Their decision must be respected and there is no point in imputing motives to them or seeking to deconstruct what their motivation might have been. The fact is we move on. There have been treaties before and there will be treaties again. Only the context will differ. May I offer one historical example? The Maastricht Treaty reformed the single European area in economic terms. That comes into being at a time when the pendulum in European politics has swung to the right. In relation to the completion of the Single Market even if it is to be curtailed by some element of social cohesion which was expanded in the Treaty of Amsterdam, the form of economic transition is influenced by neo-liberal market economics, a kind of illiterate and thuggish version of economics that does not need the term &ldquo;political economy&rdquo;. It is a very low grade kind of economics. It is simply interested in seeking the maximum return for the minimum cost in the fastest time and effectively seeks State support as much as possible to try and socialise its costs and maximise its profits.</P>
    <P>Indeed in this country we have to remember that the amount of money income, the proportion taken in profits as opposed to wages, has probably increased by 50% in the last few years. That particular model gave us versions of the economy, arguments about competition. May I give one example? In broadcasting it would facilitate the commodification of entertainment where it would be inimical to public service broadcasting. In railway, it would facilitate private transport but would be anti-public transport. The same would be true about our airline. You would be stopped from assisting a State owned airline but you would be enabled to assist any kind of gurrier wanting to go in the air, irrespective of the safety standards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> That was the thinking then. Now the pendulum has swung in the other direction. Again and again, it is not only those in the centre and left who see that you cannot tear social cohesion out of the heart of the society but that there must be a mediation of the economic effects on the society itself. The social model becomes more central, becomes more crucial. There is nothing wrong with now preparing, in the course of the forum, for these general issues and as to what kind of treaty will come next in 2004.</P>
    <P>I wish to address some of the issues raised by a previous speaker in relation to the debate in Europe. Many people in Europe have been very unhelpful in relation to our recent referendum. As an aside may I say that in 32 years in politics, I do not recall a Fianna Fáil campaign like the recent one. Let me put it like this; they were mercifully scarce on the ground in Galway. They did not bother the people at all, you could hardly see them. The posters were few and far between. One member of the Cabinet decided near the end to give a speech. The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, was thinking one thing in his heart while speaking the other way. Another member of the Government team, Minister of State for the Progressive Democrats, was extraordinarily silent.</P>
    <P>Whether I may be right or wrong, in my constituency the people have the right to expect me to declare what I am doing. They equally have the right for me to act in the way that I say. There is another interesting issue to be considered. The campaign was spoiled very early on by the kind of intolerance which I hope we have seen the end of. A campaign was run on the basis of saying that all of your opponents were really people who were wild people who did not understand the issues and they were a mixum gatherum. They are the people who won the day. We speak for the minority of those who voted. Before the referendum campaign I said that we must respect the opinions that are held for different reasons, and I say that again.</P>
    <P>It is completely wrong now, in the construction of the result, to be presenting this as a problem that the Irish people represent. It is as if the Taoiseach goes to Gothenburg and other cities dragging after him the problematic Irish people. The Irish people have problems of comprehension of some of the issues but these are minor in relation to the institutional difficulties we have. There is a desperate need to change our mechanisms in this House so that we can be involved in direct discussion on directives at the drafting stage when it counts, as is possible in both Denmark and in the House of Lords. It is important to be able to review those decisions back in the House as speedily as possible. I was President of a Council of Ministers and it is also important that all the papers and preparation for a Council meeting be publicly available and that there should be access to the Council meetings. This means that there would be a regular interaction, open and transparent interaction, and we would be dealing with Europe in a way which would develop familiarity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> May I make a point in relation to comparative political science, comparative politics in other jurisdictions. When you look at these issues as a political scientist you find something very interesting in what has happened in the Irish case. When something is being negotiated in relative diplomatic secrecy, you have two choices available to you, suspend the secrecy in a complicated matter to allow the public gaze to fall on the different elements so that when you conclude, they have been aware of your choices but they are very familiar with how you arrived at your conclusion. Your second strategy is to go to the end of the process and seek to explain it in such detail as it were, on selling. Neither of these happened successfully and we must make sure now when we are actually establishing a forum, that the forum begins with the main issues that are at the centre of Europe.</P>
    <P>Another speaker mentioned Mr. Santer's view. He was the last President of the Commission who spoke about a Europe of the citizens and how such a Europe is created. There is a crisis of governance within Europe. That crisis is reflected in the low number of people who are participating in elections as we move to an American model of participation and with falling percentages. There is an institutional crisis in which there is a certain amount of institutional atrophy. People are speaking about the future without mandate. Those with the mandate are not participating in the same debate. Thus the European Parliament tediously and slowly arrives at a particular opinion on the future of Europe, yet off-the-cuff remarks are made by those who are the appointed members of the Commission. Then in the Council of Ministers there is so much closure in relation to trading on an intergovernmental basis that that process is not open either.</P>
    <P>There is institutional atrophy in terms of the changes that have been taking place and there is confusion in relation to the delimitation of responsibilities. This crisis of governance becomes really serious if it moves into a crisis of legitimacy in relation to the political system generally. We have just had in the Nice referendum a demonstration of how something like consulting the people can become what might be called a space of contestation, that is, people come into it and they bring with them any worries they have about any aspect of unaccountable Europe, any aspect of the democratic deficit, any aspect of institutional non-transparency. In this space of contestation, they oppose those who are advocating what they believe was in fact the best decision on balance.</P>
    <P>The really dangerous side of all of this is that the only way out of it is by constructing a new vision for Europe. Deputy Roche mentioned the earlier treaties. What was the component that was attached to them that was missing on this one? The aspect of vision, a Europe of the citizens, a Europe that would not be simply economic. That is very important. Beyond the forum and into the years to come, Europe cannot be served well by <Col N="1066" /> those who work simply on a propaganda basis, on the basis that they know from inside conversations and that the wider public do not know. You then get an arrogance and a kind of low grade propaganda from those who are purporting to be disseminating information. It is in all our interests to understand the debate, to go to the forum, to participate and much more importantly, to speak about the kind of Europe we want. I hope that it happens and that it happens in good faith. I hope that it happens with tolerance. I think we should also be honest.</P>
    <P>We have to discuss the relationship of the new Europe to a world in which we have a single power in its relationship to the United States and to the world beyond Europe. All of this means nobody is saddened by the announcement after a referendum, that the vote went against it. I hope the people on all sides will use the forum to develop different models for the future. I hope also that when Europe cannot be helpful it will stay silent and that when it has something to say it will take the model of the discussion on the future of Europe in Ireland and extend it to the other countries in Europe so that we can move forward together</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the outcome of the referendum on the Nice treaty. Like other speakers I supported a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote. I knew in the last few days of the campaign that the result would be much closer than was generally expected, having been out and about in my constituency discussing the issue. Nevertheless the warning signs were there long before that. The percentage &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in previous referendums on Europe was declining and in hindsight it was only a matter of time before there was a majority &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote.</P>
      <P>In my Second Stage contribution on the referendum Bill I said we had a moral duty to facilitate the accession of Central and Eastern European states to the European Union. These countries should be given a chance to advance their democratic freedom and enjoy the economic prosperity which we enjoy. We have a moral duty to facilitate them in their endeavours. Nevertheless the people took a broader view of the issues involved, and rightly so; they were being consulted on an issue on which they are not often consulted. Many of those who voted were informed on the issues. They took stock of the European projects as best they could and considered the arguments for and against and voted accordingly.</P>
      <P>There should not be a new referendum on the Nice treaty unless there is clear evidence of a change in public opinion. We cannot put the same referendum to the people on its own. We need to develop our thinking on this issue and go back to the people with a new perspective on the European Union generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was the Nice treaty referendum defeated? The issue was not just about the Nice treaty as far as the electorate was concerned. There was a <Col N="1067" /> deep concern about the democratic deficit of the European institutions. Our old friend openness, transparency and accountability was to the fore when people were making up their minds. The result of the referendum was a wake-up call for all the states of the European Union. As other speakers have said, including Deputy Roche, it is generally accepted that if referendums are held on the Nice treaty in other EU countries they might be defeated. What needs to be seriously addressed is the view that a democratic deficit exists in the operation of the European Union institutions. There is no doubt that a factor in all our referendums relating to the European Union, which the electorate took into account, was the concept of Irish neutrality. The Rapid Reaction Force was discussed in the context of the referendum on the Nice treaty. There is a perception that Ireland will eventually be involved in some type of military alliance. That is an issue that needs to be addressed in the post Nice treaty discussions.</P>
    <P>There is confusion about what is meant by &ldquo;peacekeeping&rdquo; and &ldquo;peacemaking&rdquo;. We need to be clear on what these terms mean. Where there is confusion people vote accordingly. In our deliberations there is a need to spell out and define clearly what exactly is meant by &ldquo;peacemaking&rdquo; to and to decide if that is the way we wish to proceed indefinitely. This treaty is about expansion. However, the people saw it in terms of integration and said the case for further integration was not clearly demonstrated. That is indisputable. The people availed of the opportunity to consider all issues related to the European Union and took the view that the case for further integration has not been made.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers dealt with the interventions of the French Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, the EU President, Romano Prodi and the President of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg &ndash; the latter two are on a visit to Ireland. Such contributions were unhelpful. Certainly they did not consider the politics of their statements when a referendum was in full swing in one of the member states. I would be surprised if they did not know that at this stage.</P>
    <P>During my Second Stage contribution on the referendum Bill I said the reprimand to the Minister for Finance by the Commission and the Council of Finance Ministers was a factor in the referendum. People in my constituency and elsewhere have told me they did not like the cold reprimand to this country. If Ireland signed up to the Commission controlling our budget policy, I have no recollection of it. I would like somebody to point out where it is stated that the European Commission or the Council of Finance Ministers could dictate our budgetary policy. The people had no understanding that that was the position.</P>
    <P>In hindsight, there is no doubt the referendum was rushed. I can understand the Government's difficulty in getting people's minds concentrated on an issue such as the Nice treaty. It takes the <Col N="1068" /> holding of a referendum for people to concentrate on the issue. Following the referendum the people are concentrated on the issues involved. That is healthy and we are now involved in a comprehensive debate on the future of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of a forum on Europe. However, I hope it operates successfully. I have a few suggestions in that regard. It needs to consult widely.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach informed the House that the forum would consist of the political parties and the social partners, I was sceptical, because it was the political parties and the social partners that recommended a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote. We need to move beyond those groupings. We need to move beyond the cosy consensus and engage with the people in an imaginative way with this forum. Unless we do that, the forum will be just another talking shop that will produce a report that probably nobody will read. I look forward to hearing the details of that forum.</P>
    <P>The forum must come up with a clear vision for the European Union. We need to take stock of where we are now and where the European project is heading. In that regard, I welcome the speech by the Attorney General in a personal capacity. He has added greatly to the debate we are having at present. He sees a choice between the federalist project of a European superstate or a partnership of member states. That puts the question clearly before us as to which model we want.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Noonan, and the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn. The people have spoken and we are obliged to consult in active debate as a result of their decision. As soon as anybody puts forward a view contrary to that proposed before the referendum, they are shot down. That is not helpful. Deputies Noonan and Quinn should encourage a debate and seek different viewpoints. They claim it symbolises Government disunity. However, we must have a full, open and frank debate and everybody should give their opinions. It is extremely unhelpful, almost bordering on arrogance, for the leaders of the Opposition to say Mr. McDowell or Cabinet Ministers cannot express an opinion. We are obliged to be imaginative and thought provoking following the result of the Nice treaty referendum. I welcome that debate.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. A huge volume of work comes before that committee and under our terms of reference we are obliged to scrutinise directives, regulations and statutory instruments coming from the European Union. When we are sitting in the committee room I have no doubt we are talking to ourselves. I doubt if anybody watches us on the monitors in Leinster House or if anybody from the media considers our deliberations. We go through endless pages of directives, regulations and statutory instruments and we do our <Col N="1069" /> best to scrutinise them. Nobody listens to us and obviously that is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>In any discussion on how we should proceed, we need to establish the role of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. Is it to be responsible for scrutinising this legislation or is there a greater role for all the members of the Dáil, who would be fascinated to learn of the legislation that is proposed in these directives, regulations and statutory instruments? If people in this House knew what we were considering, they would pay much closer attention to our deliberations. The Joint Committee on European Affairs must be central to our debate on how we make the European institutions more open, transparent and accountable.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the low turnout in the Nice treaty referendum. The low turnout was not specific to the referendum on Nice. A low turnout is a problem at all elections. This is true not just in this country but in the UK and other European Union countries as well. It is a much bigger issue and one to which we need to turn our attention.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the McKenna judgment and the referendum commission. We should not now attempt to change the rules in advance of any new referendum. We can consider that issue at a different time. If we propose changes to the McKenna judgment and the referendum commission it will be seen as us trying to change the rules in order to change the result. We should examine that issue when the Nice treaty referendum is off the agenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Connaughton.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this debate. There has been more said about Europe and the broad European project since the defeat of the Nice referendum than we heard in the previous 12 months.</P>
      <P>I strongly disagree with Deputy Haughey that there has been a degree of arrogance shown by the Opposition leaders arising from recent comments by the Attorney General and other spokespersons for the Government. The arrogance during the debate and during the run-up to the debate was shown by the Government. It was arrogant to believe that the legislation could be rushed through the Dáil. It was arrogant to believe that firstly four and then three referenda could be held successfully on the same day. The Government was very arrogant in believing it could run a pathetic political campaign and believe the public would support it. The political parties that make up the Government, namely Fíanna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were arrogant to believe the sort of campaign they ran, or did not run, could pass as a political campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, is in the House and I saw very little campaigning from the Progressive Democrats. I saw no posters representing that party's point of view. I saw some Fíanna Fáil posters advocating a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote on <Col N="1070" /> Kildare Street and maybe a few on Grafton Street. A magnifying glass should have been supplied with each poster because it was impossible to see the name Fíanna Fáil or what the message was about. While the flowers on the poster would be lovely in a living room, it did not get the message across. That sort of campaign was arrogant, if it was an attempt to get people to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. However what we have since seen and heard from some Government sources makes me wonder about the strength of its desire to have the referendum passed.</P>
    <P>The result was not just disappointing but depressing. I was very depressed by the low turn out. I accept what Deputy Haughey said that there has been a difficulty in getting the electorate to engage in the political process in recent times. However, it was profoundly depressing that significantly less than 40% of the people came out to express a judgment on this issue.</P>
    <P>I readily concede that the work of the Referendum Commission was a failure. The concept of trying to present both sides of the argument by the Referendum Commission through newspaper advertisements clearly does not work. If it was designed to confuse people, it worked admirably. Notwithstanding people's difficulty with the issue, it is not acceptable to suggest that 65% of the people were so confused that they stayed at home. This country has benefited profoundly from Europe and the decision by the majority who voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Nice and in particular the decision by the majority of people to say nothing at all to Nice signals a bad day for politics. The lack of leadership shown by the Taoiseach and the Government resulted in this disappointing outcome.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland had an ideal opportunity of accepting the Nice treaty and becoming a leader among the small countries in a broader 27-country European Union. Many people were wondering, perhaps understandably, what Ireland would lose. That is somewhat mean-spirited and reflects a very narrow vision. When we come to reflect on our decision, we will see that we lost greatly by saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Nice treaty. There was an opportunity for Ireland to have the moral leadership of the ten or 12 smaller countries which would be a very significant bloc in the new European club of 27. It is disappointing that this opportunity has now passed.</P>
    <P>In assessing where we go from here, we cannot ignore the fact that the electorate has said &ldquo;No&rdquo; for various reasons, ranging from right wing fundamentalism to left wing philosophies. I found it difficult to understand why the Green Party opposed this treaty, seeing that Europe has been the only protector of our environment. Any progressive development in an environmental context has stemmed from European regulations, directives and pressure. Although the vast majority of the green movement throughout Europe was saying &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to build a better Europe, the Green Party in Ireland said &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I was disappointed to see people who claim to be <Col N="1071" /> socialists saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the Nice treaty. The great social advances in this country over the past 20 years have been directed, funded and provided by Europe and much more social progress needs to be made. Being part of a strong, expanded and dynamic Europe would be helpful in that regard. Considering the progress required in our health services, the scope for fuller participation by women in every aspect of society and the need for further child protection, it is disappointing that the greatest guarantee of all these necessities, namely Europe, has in one sense been rejected by our electorate on 7 June.</P>
    <P>I hope, as a result of that decision, we will now begin to debate more fully what we want from Europe and what part we want to play in Europe. Since 1973, the European equation, from Ireland's perspective, has had a very economic focus. We have benefited enormously from economic transfers from Europe and, over the coming years, we could become financial contributors rather than beneficiaries. We still have a major role to play in developing and shaping the continent. Arising from the decision we made on 7 June, I hope we will begin to debate the European project in its broadest terms. At least, let us put it before ourselves, as politicians, and the people of this country to decide what role we wish to play in Europe. I look forward to the establishment of the Forum for Europe as a step in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Having a life-long interest in the European Union, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter. Some 30 years ago, when I was involved in the farming organisations, we organised canvassing teams to go into the cities to generate interest in Europe. My vision of Europe and its importance to Ireland has not dimmed, although I have my own views on how far one should go. Without wishing to digress into party politics, I recall that some four or five weeks before the referendum, the Fine Gael leader, Deputy Noonan, asked the Taoiseach to initiate a debate in the House on the future of Europe after the Nice treaty. There was a sort of guffaw to the effect that the Nice treaty was on the immediate agenda and the next intergovernmental conference would talk about whatever was to happen afterwards. I do not know if such a debate might have influenced the outcome of the referendum. Naturally, I voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my observation in East Galway and other west of Ireland constituencies, people were genuinely afraid of what would happen afterwards. That was their big concern. Paradoxically, all the applicant countries have more in common with us, in terms of size and structure, than some of the original member states. It is reasonable to suggest that we would be more comfortable with the incoming states and that we would see them as helpful colleagues in the event of future internal EU difficulties. That is obviously a difficult message to get across. If the referendum was <Col N="1072" /> to be held tomorrow, it would be even more heavily defeated unless certain things happen. The Forum for Europe is an excellent idea and I expect that all political parties and interest groups will take it seriously. It will force people to say exactly what they mean and to back up some of the slogans which were used. Both the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaigns need to give their underlying rationale over the next six or 12 months. It will require more meaningful contributions than just slogans on posters. The Irish public needs high quality information. They want to know what will come after the Nice treaty.</P>
    <P>Many people are concerned and frightened about creeping federalism and the notion of the super state. They are unhappy with so-called progress being advanced without reference to a connection or relationship with people, no matter where they are. Deputy Haughey was quite correct in his comments. I have no doubt that if a referendum was held in some of the other countries, they too would have trouble with it. The reasons might be different, but it would all come out in the wash. While a certain course of action may seem appropriate to the Brussels bureaucracy, it is quite a different matter to bring the people along as part of the process. Europe has not been doing this. I am reminded of a general leading his army so far in advance as to be shot in the back by his own troops. It is not enough for the Brussels bureaucrats to issue directives if they fail to bring the people with them.</P>
    <P>A very highly regarded professional person told me that he voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; in the referendum. When I asked why, he outlined his concerns as to the source of all the EU directives and protocols and the difficulty of making direct contact with the person in the EU system who originated any given directive or finding out the reason for a particular decision. The same experience is applicable at national level and in local authorities. It can be very difficult to make a connection in relation to some schemes and regulations. One hears the phrase &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo; used. It is time for people to begin using simple language. We are losing contact with Brussels.</P>
    <P>Certain events here in Ireland have also had the effect of turning people off. The last budget is one such example. Many people said to me quite openly that they did not like a system whereby their personal taxation was being interfered with. That brings us back to tax harmonisation and all the things that go with that.</P>
    <P>It is important that we do not sit back at a time when we want to do for other countries what was done for us. The incoming countries must achieve many standards. The judiciary and the democratic process in most of those 12 or 15 countries have been turned around for the better. Would it not be unusual for us, as a nation, to stop them in their tracks from doing what we believe is right? There are a number of other side issues on this into which I do not have time to go. Suffice to say that when we have another referendum on this issue, there will have to be a very hard sell. <Col N="1073" /> What the Government and others here say will have to be absolutely clear. Nothing should be taken for granted. We talk of having a forum after the referendum but it was an awful mistake on the part of many not to have had one before the last one.</P>

    <Title>Agriculture Appeals Bill, 2001  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Connaughton.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. If there is an issue that occupies the minds of so many people in rural Ireland it is the question of an appeals body within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. In my four years in the House, and immediately prior to that, I got a rude awakening in regard to the appeals mechanism within the Department, if one could call it an appeals mechanism at all. Even though the independence of the agriculture appeals office is crucial, I am not too sure that what is being proposed by the Minister in this Bill will be in any way independent. The reason I say that is that the Minister will appoint the appeals officer and all the members on the appeals board. All we have to do is look back at the situation in the past. In my experience, it was a sad sight. I will give my reasons for saying that and I think the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, will, with justifiable reason, say I am right.</P>
      <P>I made representations on behalf of a constituent in 1997. When all the mechanisms by way of representations were exhausted, after applying great pressure on departmental officials I finally had the wonderful experience of an oral appeal to which I was called in Agriculture House. I reasonably expected &ndash; through naiveté &ndash; to get a reasonable hearing and that there would be a corresponding assessment of the points I had made previously and during the appeal. What I experienced was something that I hope no Member of this House will ever experience in the future. I was told I was a cowboy and told by a senior officer that what I was trying to do was make representations on a fraudulent application. People in Agriculture House believe people who make small, technical mistakes are attempting fraud. That is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>I was brought in before four senior officers. I found out subsequently under the Freedom of Information Act that one of the participants on that appeals board had made 14 contributions to that file. Also on that file was the statement of a senior officer in the Department saying not to reply to Deputy Burke on this question. Is that fair? Is that an instance in which we can have confidence in the Department? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is to select and appoint personnel to this appeals board, and he will appoint person<Col N="1074" /> nel from within the Department. If that is the case, it is a farce. It will be a charade which will have no meaning at all. That is why I do not accept that the Minister &ndash; I do not blame him alone &ndash; will resolve the difficulties there which have been experienced by many people who apply. If the Minister is to appoint an officer from within the Department to one of those positions, that officer will not overturn a decision made by a superior or junior officer to him. That is probably the greatest difficulty I have with this new appeals board.</P>
    <P>There are empire building people in Agriculture House. It is a sad to say that but until I have proof to the contrary, I will not be convinced otherwise. There are wonderful people in the Department who deliver many of the services in a very encouraging and positive way but alas it is not true of all and that is why I have a great problem with this. The consequences of this are that many people are denied entitlements to those scheme.</P>
    <P>Because this appeals office is dealing almost totally with schemes that are granted-aided and assisted, it is imperative the Minister appoints people who are really independent, people from outside who can come in with a clean pair of hands and with no axe to grind with superiors or junior staff and can make an objective decision. That has not happened in the past and it will not happen under the proposals of this scheme.</P>
    <P>We hear it is the intention of the Minister to go to Europe to ask it to allow for the simplification of the forms farmers must fill out. I refer the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, to the most recent application form from the Department for the extensification grant for 2001. The additional box, the second box, is absolutely confusing. The sad thing is that if a person was not warned &ndash; it is too late now because the applications have gone in &ndash; they will not know until late this autumn that a mistake has been made and a penalty will apply. It is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>No changes have been made and I have no reason to believe the Minister is serious about changing this appeals board. The information I got from the Department under the Freedom of Information Act was incomplete. I realised that a letter I had written was not there. When I noticed that I went back and got another file under the Freedom of Information Act relating to the same query which was incomplete as well. That is not good enough. What is wrong with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the officers who make such decisions to intimidate me and other public representatives? I cannot accept that and I will pursue this as long as I am a Member of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Ulick Burke, for giving me the opportunity to say something on an issue about which I have spent my lifetime talking, but I cannot say it in four minutes. I welcome the Bill. We always <Col N="1075" /> wanted an Agriculture Appeals Bill that would gain the confidence of 150,000 Irish farmers. Whether we have that now I do not know, but the last Bill did not. I never fell out with the members of the board but, unfortunately from a farmer's perspective, they seem to be within the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The problem is a matter of who polices the policemen. One of the most central matters is the independence of the board, a point to which I will return on Committee Stage. It should be far more independent than it will be under the present proposal.</P>
      <P>I have never made a case for people who defraud the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, and never would, but for the smallest misdemeanours imaginable, one could not believe the penalties that apply. What about the many farmers who submit late applications for the suckler cow grant? A wedge like procedure applies to them. For every day they are late, they lose a certain percentage, and after day 18 or 20, they lose the lot. If one considers a 30 cow farmer anywhere in the country and adds up all his payments, they add up to just over £8,000. On day 20, because of a failure to apply or do so on time, the penalty on the farmer is £8,000. What would one have to do for the judicial system to impose a fine of this value upon one? One would almost have to commit a murder. A case could not be made, on either side of the House, to suggest this is fair and equitable.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the Minister of State, he says much on this subject. I acknowledge the fact that he has an interest in it. If the system is wrong, it must be changed. There will be a revolt if this issue is unresolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to take up where Deputy Connaughton left off. I welcome this Bill. In a sense, I feel I was the handmaiden that delivered this legislation. The committee on strategic management in 1998 commenced an examination of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. It pointed out that an independent appeals mechanism was desperately needed to lend credibility to the system. I am delighted that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which argued at the time that it could not be introduced, has agreed to recant its heresy and accepted the possibility. At the time, the SMI committee brought some very senior, relevant members of the European Commission here. They indicated, particularly the Swedish representative, that it was possible. The Minister has now translated it, for which we should thank him.</P>
      <P>It would be interesting for the House to examine other aspects of the SMI report because they are reflected in the contributions of the previous two speakers. The relevant issues that we felt needed attention were the delays in payments, which were quite scandalous but have improved since, the manifest absence of an independent appeals mechanism &ndash; this Bill provides for that &ndash; and the issue Deputy Connaughton addressed, and requires further discussion, which is the proportionality of fines for human error. The level of penalty and imposition that small farmers have to bear, through honest error, is obscene. Many of the farmers are of advanced years and may not be particularly literate. Deputy Connaughton is correct in thinking that there is no Member who would carry a torch for a crook, but there are many decent men and women in farming, many of whom were not reared in bookkeeping. They are making tiny errors. I hope the new appeals mechanism, as soon as it comes into effect, will look not just at the facts of individual cases, but also at the facts of proportionality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the psychological independence of an appeals office is very important. The appeals mechanism created by the Social Welfare Act in the 1950s is very good but there is still a suspicion that it is a product of the Department. All one has to do is look at the Coolock Community Law Centre report of many years ago. That is not a fair judgment of the officials who carry out the review mechanism. Deputy Connaughton alluded to the Roman poet, Juvenal who asked: &ldquo;<i>Sed quis custodiet ipsos Custodes?</i>&rdquo;. Who guards the guardians? It is a valid question. While the appeals mechanism being created is welcome and progressive, the Minister and the first appeals board will have to ensure that the independence of the office not only exists in law, but in fact and in the minds of those people who come to it. I wish the office well and would like it to be well financed and supported. I hope the Minister of <Col N="1077" /> State will do something about the problem of proportionality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I will deal with two issues raised by Deputies Connaughton and Ulick Burke. The first concerns late applications. There are certain things one can address. Deputy Connaughton is correct in saying certain things are outside his remit. He has a valid point on the question of late applications. I have discussed the matter with the REPS officials. I am trying to arrange a system by which one will be notified that one is in a danger period if one fails to submit an application on time. I cannot change the fundamental rules of Brussels, but I can warn farmers that they are in danger of being penalised if they do not adhere to them.</P>
      <P>I have arranged that both the farmer and his planner can be given a red letter warning that one is in danger period, that one is losing a certain percentage per day, and that there are only a certain number of days left to submit the 1C form. I fully accept what Deputy Connaughton is saying. However, we must understand that our belief that time limits should not be absolute is not that of Europe, and we are bound to whatever Europe decides &ndash; as has been pointed out to me in the last few weeks. Where the penalties are concerned, the Minister and I have great sympathy with those who believe they are too severe&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is interested in the exact date of the order of Government, I can forward it to him later. To change the penalties requires the approval of Brussels. Anybody who would suggest otherwise does not understand the way the system works.</P>
      <P>With regard to the independence of the office, we must recognise that it is modelled on the successful experience of the social welfare appeals office, which is independent and yet within the Vote of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The head of the appeals office will not report through a departmental hierarchy nor will he or she need the approval of the Minister. On the contrary, the Bill specifically provides that he or she will be independent. That is the long and the short of it.</P>

      <P>I do not foresee any negative consequences arising from the organisational status of the appeals office.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise again the consistency between the proposed agriculture appeals office and the social welfare appeals office, with which I have had many dealings and have found good and sympathetic to applicants. I have attended oral hearings and I am sure most Deputies would accept that the social welfare appeals office has been more than sympathetic within the law, within which everyone must operate, to applicants in all cases.</P>
      <P>Deputies rightly pointed to the credibility of that office, which has been operating effectively and with full public confidence for a decade. They will be reassured to note that the material provisions of this Bill are identical to those governing the social welfare appeals office. The same provision will govern the independence of the two offices, the same functions will be vested in the appeals officers, the same arrangement will apply whereby the director reports to the Minister and so on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose mentioned the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. The Director of Consumer Affairs is recruited by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. The staff of that office are all on secondment from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes asked for clarification on some points. A detailed statement of the reasons for a decision will be issued in writing by the appeals officer in every case, irrespective of whether the appeal is upheld. In any event, that is already a requirement under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>Under section 11, an appeals officer can revise his or her decision or the decision of another appeals officer if new evidence comes to light since the date of the original decision or if there has been any relevant change in circumstances since the original decision was given. The director may revise any decision of an appeals officer if it appears to the director that the appeals officer made a mistake in relation to the law or the facts of the case.</P>
      <P>Section 12 provides that there will be a right of appeal to the High Court on any question of law. In addition, irrespective of what we put into this Bill, appellants always have the right of redress to the High Court by way of judicial review if there has been a breach of fair procedures by an appeals officer.</P>

      <P>Deputies on all sides of the House will agree that the social welfare appeals office has been operating for the past ten years <Col N="1079" /> and there have been no question marks over its independence or credibility. When the Minister set about putting an agriculture appeals office in place, he used the social welfare appeals office as a template. In fact, the text of many sections of the Bill, as I have already said, mirrors that in the social welfare legislation. During the debate on the Bill in the Upper House, many Senators expressed concern about the new office not being independent enough and that concern has been expressed here today. I want to reassure the House in the same way that I did the Seanad that the agriculture appeals office will be just as independent as the social welfare appeals office. The reporting structures, funding arrangements, etc., will be independent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The officers appointed to the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs come from within that Department and are assistant principal grade. They are not recruited specially by the Civil Service Commission for the post of appeals officer. When we discussed this in the Seanad, the Minister agreed to reconsider the wording of section 2, which deals with the appointment of appeals officers. The original wording, taken directly from the social welfare legislation, stated that the Minister may appoint such and so many of his or her officers to be appeals officers and every person so appointed shall hold office at the pleasure of the Minister.</P>

      <P>Recruitment of an appeals officer will not, therefore, be confined to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. This goes further than the social welfare appeals office. It should help to allay Deputies' fears about the independence of the new office from the rest of my Department. Deputy Ulick Burke must have had some bad experiences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I came to the Department I have been working with the officials, have raised many queries with them and have found them speedy and forthcoming with replies. I want to record this point in defence of people who cannot defend themselves in this House. I was not happy with the operation of some of the schemes that come under my remit. I approached the officials and <Col N="1080" /> made suggestions about better procedures to help speed up decisions. My philosophy is that one should give a good and fair decision having always considered the applicant's case within the law and make a decision on it as quickly as possible. Outside the remit of this Bill, we have considered a way of improving the procedures. I record that I have got the full co-operation of the staff working with me to ascertain how we can improve the general systems in operation.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies on both sides of the House suggested that the disease eradication schemes should also be considered by the appeals office. I gave consideration to bringing within the scope of the Bill the on-farm valuation scheme for TB and brucellosis reactors which is being developed under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, but I concluded that its central element, the valuation of reactors, was not a suitable activity for inclusion. Any appeal would have to remain in the area of valuation, involving arbitration where necessary. There will be such an appeals mechanism built into the operation of the compensation scheme. It is my considered view that the appeals office would not be the proper mechanism to consider disputed valuations.</P>
    <P>I accept, however, that there may well be benefit in assigning to the appeals office some functions under the scheme, those generating penalties where there is non-compliance by the applicant farmer with the regulations underlying entitlement to compensatory payment in the first place. Similar considerations apply here to those affecting the appeals process in the direct payments area and this would seem to be a reasonable basis for bringing the compensation scheme within the remit of the appeals office.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in a position to make provision by amendment on Committee Stage or by order whereby the new office can assume an appeals function in relation to the non-valuation aspects to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Similarly, as regards the compensation scheme for depopulations on account of BSE, I would not consider the appeals office to be an appropriate forum when the issue is one of valuation. As the evolving scheme matures, there may well be a good basis for bringing appeals under this scheme within the remit of the appeals office, but this has been left open for the time being.</P>
    <P>While the Minister can sympathise with the motivation for the provision of retrospection, he does not consider it would be realistic. It would provide in effect for the reopening of any case where the appellant was still dissatisfied with the Department or the appeals unit. In the Minister's view, that would not be productive and would raise hopes almost certain to be subsequently dashed.</P>
    <P>I envisage the regulations to be prepared under section 15 will specify a reasonable interval, perhaps 28 days, within which an appeal must be made subject to an overriding power of the director to accept late appeals. That is important for those who, for good reasons, often find it difficult <Col N="1081" /> to gather the documentation required on behalf of constituents within the 28 days required.</P>
    <P>I want to point out, and this is relevant to what Deputy Ulick Burke said, that the purpose of section 18 is to preserve the right of recourse to the Ombudsman. All of the decisions made by the appeals office can also be brought to the Ombudsman. If the procedure involved in any case was wrong, an appellant has recourse to bring his case to the Ombudsman. Most of us have had recourse to the Ombudsman in regard to certain cases over the years. He has the power to investigate cases handled by my Department's non-statutory appeals unit. The Minister and I have no difficulty with that. If we did not include section 18, the Ombudsman would no longer have this power, but that would be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>Oral hearings come under the Bill. It will be possible for appellants to bring a member of the family, an expert or a public representative to a hearing, which will be held in private, and the business conducted will, therefore, be between the appellant and the officer in attendance at the appeals hearing. In relation to the time limit that will apply, the target will be a 12 week interval for the processing of appeals.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the Irish Vocational Education Association' means a body consisting of vocational education committees, and recognised by the Minister for the purposes of this Act;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment providing for the definition of the Irish Vocational Education Association for the purposes of this Bill. This amendment is made following the debate on Committee Stage on the role of the IVEA for consultative purposes. Deputies made the case that the IVEA should have a clear role for consultative purposes where the Minister makes regulations for the purpose of providing for elections to vocational education committees. I indicated on Committee Stage that I was disposed to making such amendments and I have provided for this in amendment No. 17, which provides for legal clarity as to the position of the IVEA for the purpose of that consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies might recall that I introduced an amendment on Committee Stage which provided that the Minister would consult the IVEA when <Col N="1083" /> preparing regulations in relation to elections to be held under section 7. Initially I provided that the IVEA would be consulted only in relation to the election of the local authority members to vocational education committees. On balance and having considered the points made by the Deputies at the time, I am persuaded that it is more appropriate that the Bill contain a more encompassing reference which would allow for a general right of consultation for the IVEA on every category of regulations to be drawn up under this subsection. The IVEA has a long tradition of representing the interests and views of the VEC sector and its experience and expertise will be of great assistance in the preparation of such regulations.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 provides for the reference to sub-committees to be removed from this section. It is a technical amendment which removes an anomaly in the Bill. The Bill provides that the provisions of the 1930 Act in relation to sub-committees shall be repealed and that from the date of enactment of this legislation, all sub-committees shall be established in accordance with section 28. There is, therefore, no need to refer to sub-committees in this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 32 provides a mechanism whereby the Minister may realign the boundaries of Dún Laoghaire vocational education area, as <Col N="1084" /> set out in the 1930 Act, to become coterminus with the area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county area as established under the 1993 local government Act.</P>
    <P>While I am happy that the current arrangement is working well and it is not my intention at this time to alter the geographical remit of Dún Laoghaire VEC in any way, I recognise there is a case for realigning the boundaries of that VEC to correspond with the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county area. This amendment provides a mechanism that will allow this to be done if and when it is considered necessary or desirable. I am sensitive to the concerns of all involved in such a move and take this opportunity to reassure them that this amendment also provides for a wide ranging and comprehensive consultation process prior to any changes to the boundaries of Dún Laoghaire vocational education area.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 is a technical amendment necessitated by amendment No. 32. It is designed to accommodate any future changes to the area under the remit of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown VEC as may arise in accordance with the provisions of amendment No. 32.</P>

      <P>In amendments Nos. 10 and 15, I meet the issues raised by Deputy Creed on Committee Stage which are reflected in amendments Nos. 6, 11, 12, 13 and 16.</P>
      <P>There was a detailed discussion on Committee Stage concerning the composition of vocational education committees and, in particular, the categories of bodies that may nominate persons for appointment to vocational education committees. The Bill as initiated provided, in addition to statutory representation for members of local authorities, parents and teachers, that vocational education committees would include in their membership four extra members representative of students, voluntary organisations and local business interests. Deputies expressed particular concern about the representation on vocational education committees of Irish language interests, classes of staff that may not be represented by those staff elected to the committee and the trustees of community colleges under the remit of vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> Having considered the matter further, I am happy to include explicit references to these groups in this section. I have also taken the opportunity to widen the scope of the original provision even further. Deputy Shortall made the point that the language used in the Bill was somewhat archaic and did not reflect the reality of community organisations today. The original reference to voluntary organisations, for example, would not necessarily have provided an opportunity for a VEC to benefit from the real and active role of the many community organisations operating at local level. The groups working under the aegis of ADM are a successful example of such groups.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment also takes on board the points raised by the Deputies in amendments Nos. 6, 7, 11, 12, 13 and 16.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for going some way in accommodating the points made on Committee Stage. We are moving from a situation where four members would be selected from three possible groups to selecting four members from five possible groups. I welcome the fact that Irish language interests are specifically provided for in the amendment.</P>
      <P>I seek clarification on the issue I raised regarding staff representation, the need to ensure that there would be an equality of representation between teaching staff and parents, and the need to accommodate a representative of the non-teaching staff. Will the Minister clarify that the four persons selected will come from four of those five categories? It is not absolutely clear from the wording. Would it be possible, for example, to select those four people from two categories? I would certainly like to see a situation where there would be four people selected from four of the five different categories.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned that while the amendment goes some way towards meeting the need for representation of non-teaching staff, there is no guarantee that a non-teaching staff representative will be included on all vocational education committees. I would like to have seen that happening. I could see a situation occurring where the trustees of community colleges, might be represented on those 25% or so of vocational education committees which have community colleges and the others having a non-teaching staff representative, but my preference would have been to increase the numbers and provide for equal numbers of elected representatives and others. We do not need to ensure always that public representatives are in a majority on statutory bodies and sometimes it would be healthier if there was an equal number of both. However, I accept that the Minister has gone some way to take on board the concerns raised. I just want clarification on that point, that one could not have two representatives coming from one category.</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Shortall in welcoming the fact that the Minister has taken on <Col N="1086" /> board certain proposals made on Committee Stage, particularly in providing for a representative of the Irish language interests. It is necessary to provide for recognition of this category. In so far as County Galway is concern, half the schools within the VEC system are scoileanna lán Gaeilge and, therefore, it is important that they have an identifiable representative on the VEC.</P>
      <P>At an earlier stage, the Minister said that he wanted the membership of the VEC to be inclusive. I see no better way to recognise this than by appointing members of the staff. It is important that the teaching staff would have a representative on the VEC, and that the administrative staff would also have a representative or some other staff member on the roll within the VEC. It is important that these groups are included in the representation. The Minister stated that in those amendments he changed some of the language used previously and I welcome that also. Amendment No. 6 has been adequately catered for.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered the points the Deputy made previously on Committee Stage on the role of the local authority in appointing the four additional members to the VEC. As I mentioned previously, they go to the issue of the place of local government in the legislation and in the VEC sector as a whole. In revising the composition of vocational education committees in this Bill, I have provided for a major enhancement of the role of the vocational education committees through the inclusion on a statutory basis of the partners in education on vocational education committees, not to displace the local government but to complement them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The voice for the partners is a welcome and <Col N="1087" /> necessary addition to vocational education committees and my amendments, amendments Nos. 10 and 15, which were discussed previously, provide even greater scope for local authorities to consider the interests and views of a wide range of diverse groups when appointing the four additional members to the VEC. As Deputy Shortall raised the point, we cannot guarantee that an administrative person would be included but if two teachers are already appointed, then they at least must consider the administrative person at that stage.</P>
    <P>However, the VEC must still remain the servant of the local community, not necessarily that of any particular interest group. We have in this sector a unique opportunity to give direct expression to the voice of the local community by means of the judgment of its democratically elected representatives. Where such an opportunity exists, it should be utilised to the full.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, responsibility for the appointment of the community interest to the VEC should remain with the representatives of the local community, that is, the local authority members. In expressing this view, I am mindful of the long and distinguished contribution which local government has made to the VEC sector.</P>
    <P>The position of local authorities was enshrined in the original VEC legislation. There were sound reasons for so doing. At that time the local authority sector provided the bedrock for the development of what was then a relatively new and untried experiment in Irish education. Their inclusion provided the VEC sector with a direct link with local communities, a link constantly reinforced and revitalised by local elections. Furthermore, that direct link in turn created the moral authority for the vocational education committees to continue to undertake their pioneering work in the field of local education, not least the development of adult education in which they have been very active as well as the institute of technology structures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I asked a question but did not receive an answer and I was keen to get it before turning to this amendment. The Bill gives control to local authorities for more than 13 of the 17 places. This is an undue influence for public representatives. If we are serious <Col N="1089" /> about having real partnership within the education system this means giving a say, influence and control to the other partners outside of the elected public representatives. For that reason I favour the idea that the nine nominated public representatives and councillors, the two parents and two staff members form a core group that would nominate the four outside members.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I expressed concern that there would be a repeat of what happened in the past, that is, the local county council would make appointments often on political grounds and depending on people's persuasions, rather than on the expertise or experience they can bring to membership of the VEC. In view of this it is important that those other partners, the parents and teachers, have a direct say in the composition of the committees. That is why this amendment proposes in line 16 to delete the words &ldquo;after consultation with&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;on the nomination of&rdquo; the core group to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) (<i> a</i>)A vocational education committee may, with the consent of the Minister, cause such one or more private companies to be formed and registered under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999, as it considers appropriate, to perform such of its functions, as it considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)A company formed and registered pursuant to <i>paragraph (a)</i> shall be wholly owned by the vocational education committee concerned.</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>)The memorandum and articles of association of a company formed and registered pursuant to <i>paragraph (a) </i>shall be in such form consistent with this Act as may be determined by the vocational education committee concerned with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>(<i>d</i>)For the purposes of this subsection a company shall be wholly owned by a vocational education committee if it has no members other than that vocational education committee and its nominees.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage I signalled my intention to introduce amendments on Report Stage which would allow vocational education committees and ITs to set up limited companies in pursuit of their functions. This amendment provides a means for vocational education committees to do this. Currently vocational education committees have no statutory power to enter into limited companies. In recent yeas, however, organisations have increasingly used the device of establishing such a company as a means of engaging in particular activities while providing some security for the organisation in the event of the project failing.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that much EU project funding is sometimes conditional upon the use of a limited company as a vehicle to undertake a project. In the absence of a statutory provision, vocational education committees have had to forego participation in otherwise worthwhile projects. This is a radical new development for the VEC sector and I consider it important that at this time safeguards should be put in place to ensure this provision will not be abused. Accordingly, the amendment provides that the establishment of such companies by a VEC shall require ministerial sanction and any such arrangements will be subject to ministerial guidelines.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister outline instances where it is necessary for vocational edu<Col N="1092" /> cation committees to have a limited company status to perform a function? He refers to EU project funding. As it stands, vocational education committees have substantial EU funding for various projects. Why is it necessary to accredit limited company status to vocational education committees?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the sanction of the Minister for Finance is required for a company wholly owned by the VEC. Is the sanction of the Minister for Finance also required in the case of a company that is part owned by the VEC, for example, a joint venture? What are the accountability arrangements if others are involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>They can only enter wholly owned companies. It is in effect a protection for the State. Regarding the more general point, the provision will ensure that they can avail of EU funds. In the past, they often could not avail of certain EU funds because of requirements that are designed to protect the EU. The vocational education committees could not enter the necessary company arrangements and they had to forego certain funds. However, universities do not face that difficulty. One would normally expect the Department of Finance not to be in favour of this provision because it gives vocational education committees wider opportunities. However, as a safeguard, the sanction of the Minister and the Minister for Finance will be required. If it involves a worthwhile and reasonable project, there is no reason they should not undertake it in the same way as a university, etc.</P>
      <P>I referred yesterday to the reorganisation in the Department. One of those measures will ensure that IT issues will come under the Higher Education Authority in the context of funding arrangements and controls. This will regularise that area. At present, vocational education committees do not have the power to be involved and, consequently, they missed out on many projects in the past.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 18, after &ldquo;staff.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The performance by the chief executive officer of the functions outlined in this section may be the subject of an appeal to the vocational education committee by an interested party or their representative.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to include a mechanism for an appeal regarding the performance of the chief <Col N="1093" /> executive officer's functions. It would be an iron handed approach if no appeal mechanism was included and an aggrieved party did not have an opportunity to appeal a decision of a chief executive officer. I ask the Minister to consider this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed at length on Committee Stage and the Minister undertook to examine it further. There is concern among teaching staff that the Bill as it stands does not make any provision for an appeal system if a staff member has a dispute with the decision of a chief executive officer. In terms of an appeal mechanism, a right of appeal to the VEC itself is probably the most satisfactory arrangement and it has been requested by staff.</P>
      <P>Teaching staff do not have access to the traditional labour relations machinery that is available to private sector workers and it appears the Bill does not contain an appeals mechanism. Teachers may be able to appeal to the Minister, but that is not a desirable option. I support the amendment that would ensure there is a right of appeal to the VEC itself in the event of a dispute or dissatisfaction with a decision of the chief executive officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the point raised by Deputy Shortall, I refer the Deputies to section 15(5) which states:</P>
      <P>Subject to sections 7 and 8 of the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 1944, and <i>section 11,</i> a chief executive officer shall, in addition to the function conferred on him or her by or under this Act or any other enactment (whether passed before or after the passing of this Act), perform any function relating to the control, supervision, service, remuneration, privileges or superannuation of members of the staff of that vocational education committee, or any one or more of such members of staff.</P>
      <P>This provision is subject to sections 7 and 8 of the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 1944, which contain strong provisions in relation to inquiries through the Minister. I assure the Deputy that this area is already well covered. A sworn inquiry must take place if there is any argument about a matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the philosophy of the Minister's decisions this week with regard to devolving functions from the centre of the <Col N="1094" /> Department, it would make sense to include an appeal mechanism at a lower level. If a staff member has a concern, he or she should have the option of going to the VEC rather than the Minister. Most issues probably would be resolved at local level if there was a local appeal mechanism instead of the need for a sworn inquiry and an appeal to the Minister. It makes sense to keep it at local level if matters can be resolved there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Deputies want to have a simpler appeals mechanism. I have considered those points in relation to the role of the VEC in staffing matters. As Deputies are aware, I have provided in the Bill that the management of staff will, henceforth, be an executive function. As such, it will be the responsibility of the chief executive officer of each VEC to ensure that all staff functions are carried out in an efficient, effective and fair manner. Furthermore, those existing protections for staff already contained in the body of VEC legislation, in particular those in the 1944 Act, remain and will be unaffected by this legislation.</P>
      <P>Teachers in VEC schools are, in the main represented by the Teachers' Union of Ireland which is a party to the teachers' conciliation and arbitration scheme through which national agreements in relation to terms and conditions of the employment of teachers are negotiated. I am, therefore, satisfied that there are well established protections already in place in many instances and that where such do not exist this Bill provides chief executive officers with sufficient flexibility to develop and implement local appeals procedures. When considering the need for local appeals procedures chief executive officers must have regard to the need to ensure that staff are treated in an equitable and fair manner at all times. It could be unhelpful to prescribe a particular form or process in the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that a mechanism for appeals by staff to the VEC be included in the Bill. While I accept what the Minister says about other mechanisms which are in place, they are so far out of reach as to be of no use in the ordinary situation. It would be totally unwieldy to appeal to the Minister to resolve a simple difficulty. Such a difficulty could be resolved by a simple appeal to the committee. For that reason it is necessary to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 12, after line 53, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17.&ndash;(1) The chief executive officer of a vocational education committee shall, whenever required to do so by the committee of Dáil Éireann established under the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to examine and report to Dáil Éireann on the appropriation accounts and reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General (hereafter in this section referred to as the &lsquo;Committee'), give evidence to that committee on&ndash;</P>

      <P>(<i>c</i>)  the systems, procedures and practices employed by the vocational education committee for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of its operations, and</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these three amendments is to copperfasten the accountability of vocational education committees to committees of the House, particularly the Committee of Public Accounts. <Col N="1097" /> Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 are based on provisions in other legislation recently passed, namely, the Human Rights Commission Act and the Employment Equality Act, 1998. Amendment No. 25 has been tabled on the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and clears up any potential misunderstandings about the position of the chief executive officer of the VEC as accounting officer in the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1923. The amendment ensures that the chief executive officer will act formally as the accounting officer.</P>

      <P>In page 18, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) In exercising its functions pursuant to <i>subsection (1),</i> a vocational education committee shall have regard to the desirability of including members nominated from the various constituent groups of the committee on any subcommittee.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This revisits the principle I spoke of earlier of ensuring that the various partners in education are represented at all levels as well as on the committee itself. They would, therefore, be represented on any sub-committees set up by a VEC. To date other partners played no role on sub-committees of vocational education committees, some of which are very important. If we establish the principle that there should be broad representation on the committee, it follows logically that there should be the same kind of representation on the sub-committees. The other partners have every right to be represented at every level in decision making. For that reason I propose that we include the amendment, which does not tie anybody's hands. It sets down the principle that there should be broad representation on all decision making bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. In Deputy Creed's amendment it is clear there is a recognition of the difficulties that were manifest in the past. Sub-committees were very often notorious for the manner in which their members were selected. I hope the Minister will see the necessity for including the amendment in the name of either Deputy Shortall or Deputy Creed, both of which would guarantee that the sub-committees as well as the committee would be composed of representative groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have carefully considered the matter of the composition of the sub-committees of vocational education committees since the debate on Committee Stage. The Deputies are proposing that the VEC will no longer have the right to determine the composition of a sub-committee. That would not be appropriate. The remit of sub-committees under this Bill is varied. There may well be occasions when it would not only be desirable but also effective to limit the number of members of a sub-committee to two or three, for instance, a sub-committee exploring a proposal and reporting back to a VEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that in amendment No. 27 Deputy Creed has provided that VEC members may waive their right to be included on a sub-committee. However, I consider the alternative of simply leaving it to the discretion of the VEC to be preferable. On Committee Stage I undertook to examine the possibility of including a reference in this section to the need for vocational education committees to have regard to the principle of partnership in the formation of sub-committees. On reflection the principle of partnership is <Col N="1100" /> enshrined and given expression by the composition of the VEC membership itself. As the establishment of a sub-committee is a reserved function and therefore requires a decision by the VEC in relation to the size and membership of the sub-committee, I am happy that the views of all partners will be considered in the making of such decisions and that, where the VEC considers it appropriate, sub-committees will reflect the composition of the VEC itself. While I strongly support the principle of partnership that now underpins the whole education sector, it has been and remains my view that vocational education committees should organise their own business and that rather than restricting the capacity of vocational education committees to manage their affairs, this legislation should accommodate them in so doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's response because we discussed this at length on Committee Stage. It is all very well having broad principles on partnership but it is important that principles are also applied in the detail of the performance of functions. My intention is not to bring about circumstances where a VEC would no longer have the right to determine the composition of its sub-committees but quite the reverse. It is somewhat disingenuous to suggest that I was trying to do so. The wording says simply that the VEC should &ldquo;have regard to the desirability of including members nominated from the various constituent groups.&rdquo;  If we are serious about partnership we will ensure that at least some of partners who are not public representatives will be represented on the sub-committees. It is a retrograde step not to set down that principle in relation to the composition of sub-committees.</P>
      <P>The practice in the past has been that sub-committees have not always worked well because they have been controlled exclusively by public representatives, very often of a particular persuasion. That has brought vocational education committees and their functions and procedures into disrepute on occasions. We should have moved beyond that putting in place full, open and accountable procedures. That includes making statutory provision for each of the partners involved. Otherwise it amounts to no more than paying lip service to the principle. It is unfortunate that the Minister is not prepared to yield on the matter. I will press my amendment.</P>

      <P>When we concluded last night I was outlining the deal that has been agreed. In her contribution the Minister referred to the sale and purchase agreement. This is also referred to in the Bill in a number of places. In putting the Bill though the House tonight we are asked to agree to the terms of the sale and purchase agreement without having seen it. In a way we are agreeing to something we have no seen. My colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern, asked the other day about the land. That is a matter that had not been divulged up to then. Were it not for the fact that he asked it is unlikely we would have been told about it. There are issues such as the sale and purchase agreement on which it would have been useful to have been briefed given that it is an integral part of the deal.</P>
      <P>On balance it appears Tosco is getting a good deal and everyone regards it is a good deal for the State. We are told that by offloading this asset we are guaranteeing the future of the economy, the consumer and the employees at least for 15 years but, hopefully, for much longer. That would be the wish of the House. Perhaps the Minister would refer to this matter in her reply.</P>
      <P>Has the European Union been consulted and, if so, are there are any problems in regard to anti-competitive laws, State aids, etc., that may affect us later?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the deal and how the sale process went through, we have ended up with a deal between Tosco Corporation and the State and INPC. I appreciate that much work has been devoted to this by officials in the Department and by others. If today the Minister were to reopen the deal and invited anybody who wished to make a bid to do so, what would be the result? Would <Col N="1102" /> other companies be interested and would the State have got a better deal?</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the proposed transaction the State will receive $100 million from Tosco and the INPC will retain a certain debt. What is the net gain to the State after the deal has gone through and how is it arrived at? We are told it will be a small gain but it is hard to quantify it. I appreciate that the stock on hand is to be resold. Given that it was bought in the first instance by INPC, how does it balance out? Would it not be easier if the money coming to the State from Tosco had been debited by the debt and we knew the net proceeds? It would have been more transparent if that was the case. How are employment and other matters being copperfastened? If, for example, in three, four, five or ten years' time Tosco decides to close the refinery and walk away, what comeback, if any, has the State given that, according to the Minister, this is a strategically important facility for the State? Are the sale documents enough to give the State the assurances required? Have bonds or other guarantees been entered into?</P>
    <P>I mentioned last night that Tosco is being taken over by a larger entity, Phillips Petroleum Corporation. What negotiations have taken place with Phillips Petroleum Corporation and how does it view the deal? I realise we are a small fish in a large pond but small fish have a habit of getting eaten up in large ponds. I am also concerned about the effect on the smaller Irish customers of INPC. Can the Minister give assurances to these Irish indigenous companies that they will not be threatened? Can she give assurances that their future may even be safeguarded or enhanced by the arrival of Tosco on the scene?</P>
    <P>It would be useful if the Minister were to give details of the employee share ownership plan. This issue is being voted on shortly by the workforce. Had this debate been delayed until after the workers had decided and it was known how they were thinking then hopefully everyone here would be on side? Is every staff member in INPC being treated equally in regard to ESOP? I know the answer but I would like if the Minister could put it on the record. Are any special benefits accruing to any staff members of INPC as a result of this transaction that have not been put on the record to date?</P>
    <P>While we are told that overall this is a good deal I have expressed a few concerns. Another concern, on which we are tabling an amendment, is what happens in the event that this company, or a future company, decides to close the refinery and walk away? Can it sell it to anyone it wishes for any reason and, if so, would emergency legislation be necessary? Should it revert to a greenfield site? There are parallels with ISPAT. I hope the problems at that company will be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. IFI in Cork Harbour is concerned in the event of closure that there would be a provision that it would revert to a greenfield site. It that were to happen it would be a massive cost on the Exchequer. Has the Mini<Col N="1103" /> ster looked far into the future? Is it possible to provide for that in legislation? I have tabled amendments on this matter for discussion later. I am not sure whether it can be done but I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>
    <P>This refinery is an essential facility in the State. There are thousands of Irish consumers who rely on fuel from the INPC on a daily basis. Last winter and the previous winter fuel levels were low in some parts of the country. At one stage the National Oil Reserves Agency supply had to be tapped into. Will the Minister refer to the informal arrangement that exists whereby the refinery can help in the case of disruption from local or international events? What arrangements has she made with the new owners to ensure that continues?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to welcome this Bill because I fully support what the Minister is doing. Both she and the board of INPC have done a good job between them in bringing about this arrangement. I support the sale by the State of various Irish public companies. I would love to see the Minister being as successful in the disposal of Aer Lingus, CIE and other activities that are an encumbrance to the State and the taxpayer. I wish her luck in that and I hope she will bring the same magic to bear on those august bodies as on the INPC.</P>
      <P>I have a particular interest in this because I started the INPC. It is the only State company I formed and I only formed it because I had to. I did not altogether agree with it, but I was faced with the situation in Baghdad in the summer of 1978 whereby, if I was to acquire oil for Ireland that was extremely badly needed at the time, I could only do so by forming a State oil company. Later that year on 23 December, I went to Oslo to try to acquire what was described as a golden block in the North Sea. Again it was the same story. The Norwegians were more than willing to sell it or allot it to the Irish but not to any private company. In the summer of 1978 I had given directions that a State company be established. When I came back from Oslo on Christmas Eve I found that had not been done.</P>
      <P>For the first and only time in my career as a Minister, I found that there was resistance to the policy that I had decided on by certain civil servants. I had to have a discussion with the most senior of them and I suggested to him that if he did not agree with my policy, he had an option open to him at the following general election. The following morning he resigned from the Civil Service. Because of the delay, I then had to form this company, not as a State board, but as a limited company under the Companies Acts. It was originally set up only as a trading company and it traded very successfully at a time of great difficulty in 1979. At the time, we were not thinking of the terms of trade at all; we were thinking of simply being able to buy oil at virtually any price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were very successful in Iraq. I was greatly <Col N="1104" /> facilitated by a number of ministers at that time who expressed great good will to Ireland. They accepted my undertaking that I would establish a State oil company in Ireland and that I would not sell any of the oil provided by Iraq to any of, what were then known as, the seven sisters. I honoured that undertaking later, even though a very lucrative offer was made to me by one of the seven sisters to dispose of a substantial amount of oil I had bought in Baghdad at what would have been a very considerable profit to the Irish Exchequer at the time.</P>
    <P>I did not envisage this company being anything other than a trading company, but in 1982 the people who then owned the Whitegate refinery decided to give it up, partly as a result of the bad relations that existed between the Irish State and certain major oil companies, to which I may well have contributed myself. The then Government decided it had no option but to take it over. I never regarded it as a great bargain. There were huge difficulties and the Minister has explained some of them very well in her speech, particularly the mandatory regime which was a very artificial sort of subsidy. However, it was not the Exchequer that was paying the subsidy but the Irish consumer who paid over many years.</P>
    <P>There was the appalling tragedy involving the <i>Betelgeuse</i> after which, when Chevron gave away Whiddy, it was logical that that asset should be acquired by the INPC even though it was not a valuable asset at that stage. I think it was acquired for nothing and, of course, the State got a significant amount of money because Chevron did not honour its obligations relating to Whiddy.</P>
    <P>The net result is that today the INPC at Whitegate has been staggering on from year to year with a rather uncertain future and this arrangement, which has been made, is an excellent one and I support it. The Minister said in her speech that there was a written undertaking that these arrangements were guaranteed for 15 years. I suggest that that is unenforceable. I do not see how it can be enforced. I am sure the undertaking is offered in all good faith, but even since these negotiations began, the ownership of the purchasing company has changed. It seems it is now owned by a very much bigger company. I do not know if the Minister or any of her successors could enforce this undertaking if it were subsequently breached either by the present purchaser or by somebody that has taken it over.</P>
    <P>One of the happier aspects of this is that, where the INPC in its first incarnation, was founded by an O'Malley now, in its second incarnation, it is being taken over by an O'Malley.</P>

      <P>I wish him every success. I think the State is getting a remarkably good bargain. When I read the Minister's speech, I see that the bargain is not quite as good as I thought it was when I read it in the papers. There are very many liabilities as well and there are all sorts of small print that have not been divulged to the House. That is a pity. On the face of it the Minister did a good job, but she should have laid the agreement on the table of the House and let us read it. There may be all kinds of small print that make this less attractive from the Irish point of view than we believe. On the face of it, it seems excellent because the State is not alone getting rid of a wasting asset, which only survived because of an artificial subsidy, but it is actually getting paid, unlike another place in Cork Harbour where it received £1 and paid out many millions and we are now facing the possible closure of it.</P>

      <P>The board and the present chief executive of the INPC are to be congratulated on the work they have done to bring this about. I am glad it appears to have fairly universal support in this House. I am sure it also has pretty universal support in the country as a whole. I hope we will see an expansion of activities in both Whitegate and Whiddy. I think it was excellent that some years ago Whiddy was partly reopened on a single buoy mooring basis. However, it is much less satisfactory than the original arrangement there because it cannot deal with vessels that it used to. Its importance is in terms of strategic storage. Whitegate's importance was often exaggerated because, in my view, it is no longer vital to have refining capacity on this island.</P>
      <P>Milfordhaven is much closer to the main oil markets in Dublin and on the east coast than Whitegate and is a much more convenient place from which to buy refined oil products. Nonetheless, Whitegate lasted way beyond its time and performed a valuable function in many respects. I am glad this Bill, which sees the end of its initial chapter as a publicly owned facility, will hopefully lead to an even more successful chapter as a privately owned facility in the future.</P>

      <P>I am sharing time with Deputy Daly. My only connection with the Whitegate refinery was that my late father and father-in-law helped to construct the refinery in the early 1960s. Many of my constituents in Cork North Central have worked there and many are retired on pension. While I welcome the Bill, I am concerned about a number of issues in relation to the sale of Irish National Petroleum Corporation's business and commercial assets to Tosco in the US. I welcome the employee share options scheme for the workforce. I am concerned about the pensioners, many of whom have approached me on the matter. The workers will do well from this sale and I thank the Minister for ensuring <Col N="1106" /> that they were well looked after. The pensioners, as far as I know, will not receive anything out of the company and its assets, other than the pensions to which they are already entitled. I ask the Minister to consider if anything can be done in that regard for the pensioners.</P>
      <P>The Seveso directive has been mentioned earlier. The facilities in Whitegate and Whiddy could come under that directive. That is a matter of concern. Has the Minister investigated whether the Whitegate refinery would, in fact, come under the Seveso directive? If it does, would that mean that all the land around the refinery would be sterilised? I know that my constituency colleague, Deputy Kelleher, raised the issue yesterday and I understand that the Minister will look into the implications. Other industries in the lower harbour are already under threat from the Seveso directive and are currently being looked at, including NET, which is also coming up for sale shortly. I welcome the undertaking by the US company to operate the refinery and oil terminal for at least 15 years on a fully commercial basis, without support from DNR, and a further undertaking to maintain existing jobs and conditions of employment. Could the Minister clarify whether that is a legal requirement and if there will be penalties if the existing jobs are not maintained? </P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has referred to the current difficulties in Irish ISPAT and obviously one should not say very much in advance of the Tánaiste's meeting with the owners of the company in London tomorrow. I welcome all the initiatives which have been taken and the responsibility shown by all concerned, including public representatives, the unions and staff and the suppliers and creditors of the company. I hope it will be possible to save Irish ISPAT and that the workers will not lose their jobs.</P>
      <P>With regard to the INPC transaction, I welcome the provision for security of supply. I understand the proposed transaction means that Ireland will retain the strategic benefits of having an indigenous oil refining and terminal capacity at least cost to taxpayers and consumers. The State will no longer be directly involved in the commercial side of the oil industry and will be in a position to refocus attention on strategic oil security concerns. I understand that, in an oil emergency, the Minister will have extensive powers which will continue to extend to the refinery and terminal regardless of ownership. That is very important. The National Oil Reserves Agency &ndash; NORA &ndash; maintains strategic 90-day stocks of oil, in compliance with international obligations. Although currently a subsidiary of INPC, NORA is not included in the transaction and will continue to operate in the State sector. Could the Minister clarify if the 90-day stocks will be maintained and stocked by Tosco on behalf of the State or will some stocks be maintained overseas? The crisis of the 1970s should not be forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I chaired a meeting of the Committee on Public Enterprise last week at which <Col N="1107" /> officials of the company and the Secretary General of the Department and his staff gave a very detailed analysis of what is proposed. They answered very fully and frankly the questions which arose at that meeting and I thank them for being so forthright. I compliment the Minister on what seems to be a very successful transaction which should offer an opportunity for development. I understand there was some discussion about a development plan for the future, in terms of strategic development of the site itself. I do not know if that is written into the agreement.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of concerns, especially on the part of the small oil companies such as TOP, Tedcastles, Estuary Fuel and Campus, many of whom supply the Munster and Connacht market fairly substantially. They fear that, in this arrangement, they may well suffer a competitive disadvantage as a result of the actions of this company when it takes full control. They would like to see the commitments which, apparently, have been given by the company in the negotiations with the Department, written into the legislation.</P>
      <P>I also wish to refer to the effect of this deal on the consumer. It has been suggested that the obligation on the oil companies to purchase part of their supply from INPC represented a cost of about 10p per gallon on the price of petrol. Can the consumer now expect a corresponding price reduction, or what effect will the changeover have on the consumer price? It seems reasonable to expect that the consumer should do better in the new arrangement and should see substantial reductions. Perhaps the Minister would comment on this. It is most important that the consumer be taken into account, having carried the cost of the former situation. In the new arrangement, some benefits should accrue to the consumer by way of price reductions on petrol, diesel, home heating oil and other commodities.</P>
      <P>In general, I compliment the Minister on arrangement she has made. Hopefully, she can write into the legislation the commitments given in private discussion.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I am sharing time with Deputy Bradford. In the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Bill, 2001, we have yet another privatisation by this Government which has been involved in a privatisation frenzy since it came to power four years ago. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are now so suffused with the ethos of the capitalist market that virtually the only economic policy, if one can call it such, that they cling to is to privatise every valuable national asset that still remains in State ownership and to off-load them to private interests in such a way that they finish up in the hands of multinational corporations. This is entirely consistent with the policy which has been driving the European Union for several years &ndash; a policy which has been dictated not by the interests of working or ordinary people but by the <Col N="1108" /> interests of the multinational corporations exerting huge pressure on Governments in the EU through such organisations as the European Round Table and other pressure groups from big business in the EU.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil, in particular, has a shameful record in selling off our natural resources. The Corrib gas field which has been handed over to Enterprise Oil is an outrageous robbery of an extremely valuable asset that properly belongs to the people, yet the commercial and economic benefit from it has been handed lock, stock, and barrel by a Fianna Fáil dominated Government to yet another multinational corporation on foot of a deal which they probably cannot believe is so favourable to them with no royalties and with a corporation tax rate which they can write off against expenses not only incurred in Ireland, but elsewhere. Incredibly, when the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources stood up in the Dáil and I asked him how much value should be placed on the one trillion cubic feet of gas estimated to be in the Corrib field, the Minister, on behalf of the Government, admitted he had no idea how much this resource was worth. A significant resource was handed over without any independent assessment and without any independent supervision of the company to whom it was given.</P>
      <P>Now the Government has agreed to sell the Irish National Petroleum Corporation to Tosco Corporation &ndash; a major oil company with the bulk of its operations in the United States. This is a company to whom the Government proposes to hand over our entire oil refining industry and major oil distribution industry. The Minister, however, did not give us the history of this company and its record in critical areas in the United States. Tosco Corporation has a criminal safety record that has resulted in the deaths of workers not only on one occasion, but on two occasions at its Avon plant in Martinez, California. It also has a disastrous environmental record causing catastrophic pollution to ecosystems where it has been operating.</P>
      <P>On 23 February 1999 four workers were killed in a fire at Tosco's Avon refinery in California. In a report that was produced in 2001, the United States Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board found that the management of the company was negligent and that it was routine negligence that led to four workers losing their lives in that accident. According to board member Rosenthal:</P>
      <P>Better management of job planning and execution could have prevented this tragedy. Our investigation uncovered two root causes of the accident. First, Avon refinery management did not have an effective process for assessing the dangers of maintenance operations and implementing needed safeguards. Second, neither the parent Tosco Corporation nor the facility management had investigated or corrected a pattern of serious unsafe practices at the Avon refinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> Only two years before the 1999 disaster, an explosion at the same plant killed another worker and injured 46 others. A federal investigation reported that the same management deficiencies were responsible for the death of that worker and the injuries to the others, yet the Minister for Public Enterprise proposes to hand over to people guilty of criminal negligence the lives and the health of 150 Irish workers. That is a betrayal of those workers and of the health and safety legislation of this State. It is a betrayal of the people of this country. Would the Minister license a driving school to a person guilty of two major road tragedies where people had been killed as a result of deliberate negligence? That is what she proposes to do in regard to this critical sector of the national economy.</P>
    <P>Tosco also has a disastrous record of environmental destruction. It has been guilty of severe ongoing dioxin pollution violations. Its own tests, let alone independent monitoring, showed dioxin levels in its waste discharge to San Francisco Bay routinely and dramatically over the discharge limit. One of the environmental groups, Communities for a Better Environment, has monitored it and has said that dioxin is a useless by-product of industrial processes involving chlorine and the most toxic group of synthetic chemicals known. A major study showed 1998 documented dioxin contamination of San Francisco Bay fish at levels that result in high risk of cancer, endometriosis, diabetes and childhood learning problems in subsistence anglers and their families.</P>
    <P>The city of Santa Monica, California, is suing 18 oil companies, including Tosco, for damages that could exceed $200 million claiming that the firms polluted drinking water wells with the possibly cancer causing gasoline additive MTBE. The mayor of the city of Santa Monica said &ldquo;thanks to the oil industry, the City can no longer use most of its drinking water. . . . . The time has come for the oil industry to pay for the clean-up of its pollution&rdquo;. The Minister proposes to hand beautiful Bantry Bay over to the mercy of a multinational corporation with this record of destruction &ndash; Bantry Bay with its crucial fishing and tourism industries. The Minister has been seriously negligent in not telling the Dáil about the disastrous record of this corporation to which she proposes to sell the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that Fine Gael and the Labour Party are acting as cheerleaders to the Minister in this. I oppose this Bill. I will challenge a division tonight, even if I stand alone on these benches, to lay down that it is a criminal act to give this company to these people with criminal negligence records and to give away another national resource which could have been developed and could have moved into exploration and other areas of our natural resources as a publicly owned company. That would be the alternative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Joe Higgins for <Col N="1110" /> sharing his time. I might not agree with all of his analyses but he presented an alternative view to what most people would have seen in this legislation. It is not a black and white issue, as with any Bill passing through the Dáil. The issues raised by Deputy Joe Higgins are worthy of consideration. I hope the Minister will respond to them.</P>
      <P>Last night we debated the Fine Gael Private Members' motion on Aer Lingus. We appear to have reached a stage where there is an acceptance that State enterprise is out of political favour. We have travelled a long political route since the 1970s and 1980s. If this type of proposal were passing through the Dáil in that period there would have been charges of privatisation and selling off the State silver. It would not have been easy politically, some years ago, to do what the Minister is doing. That State enterprise is out of favour does not mean that it is wrong. We should reflect carefully before we decide to progress further on our present path.</P>
      <P>There is a consensus in the House that this legislation is a step in the right direction, but I hope the Minister will respond to the queries that have been raised. Where Whitegate is concerned, it is an important national asset. Deputy Stanton has given a detailed résumé of what is being said about the matter in our constituency. Forty percent of the national fuel requirements are provided through the Whitegate refinery. What we are now discussing has a huge bearing on national fuel supply.</P>
      <P>Domestic fuel companies are very dependent on the fuel supplied from Whitegate, and they make a strong argument that a successful Whitegate refinery operation allows them to purchase fuel at a competitive cost. There is a concern among fuel companies that without an operation such as Whitegate, they will not be in a position to purchase their fuel supplies at competitive rates that allow them to thrive and afford savings to the consumer.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware of the ongoing debate throughout the country on the price of petrol and the variations in price. While competition is the spice of life, it is essential that the facilities the Whitegate refinery could offer to Irish fuel supply companies are available under the new owner. That is the leap of faith we are taking in this legislation. There seems to be no legislative obligation on the new American owner to give the same guarantees of fair dealing to the smaller Irish companies. I am sure that point has been made by my colleagues and I am interested to hear the response of the Minister. If we make the leap of faith without those guarantees being made available, we will not only have unhappy former employees of the Whitegate company, but many concerned consumers wondering what kind of deal they will get from the new owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The competitive status of the Irish fuel companies must be maintained. The people who have worked at Whitegate over the years have played a major part in its development and expansion <Col N="1111" /> and their interests must be looked after by the Minister and her Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the discussion on this Bill. I thank the parties for accepting the Bill and dealing with it in such a thorough fashion. There were many points made in the debate that I will try to address. Concern has been expressed on behalf of small independent companies and I note that the Fine Gael amendments deal with the Tedcastle concerns which we received in our Department. Everybody is entitled to put forward views here and we seek legal advice on them and give them due consideration.</P>
      <P>The Irish retail market, in which INPC is not involved, is dominated by the major companies such as Esso, Statoil, Texaco etc. They account for 70% of the retail market as of now. There are several smaller operations, which Deputy Daly mentioned, such as Maxol, Tedcastle, Estuary, etc. They account for 30% of the market.</P>
      <P>If the legislation passes through both Houses of the Oireachtas, the existing contracts between INPC and its customers will pass to the new owners and they will be regulated under normal commercial terms. One cannot force them to do anything and it would be wrong to try. The reduction of the mandatory regime has not been dealt with comprehensively in today's discussion. The INPC existed from year to year and the whim of whatever Government was in power determined whether the mandatory regime amounting to £15 million paid by the consumer, would be authorised. I do not look upon that with rancour. It was a fact of life. A former Cabinet decided to dispense with the mandatory regime. After about four months, it was not done because of a knowledge of the clear dangers involved. It had not been done by 1997.</P>
      <P>When I became Minister, there was a huge need for investment in the site. The Government did not offer a letter of comfort but backed a loan taken out by INPC of £70 million for Auto-Oil I. In 2005, it will be under Auto-Oil II and the new owners will have to comply with that. That will require an equal investment to reflect our environmental needs, a point of which we have lost sight.</P>
      <P>General reassurances have been given regarding the question of the EU. The Competition Authority has assured us in writing that it is aware of the arrangement and that it meets their requirements. Compliance and competition rules are being addressed by Tosco and the INPC has applied for clearance from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We received a reply from the Competition Authority agreeing with the way the matter has been dealt with and with what will emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe raised the matter of the remaining debt from the 1986 developmental plan as outlined by Garret Fitzgerald <Col N="1112" /> for the area in question. That is clearly a political matter and one we have asked other Departments to consider, but whatever money will be realised from this will not come to our Department. It will go to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and be put into the general Exchequer fund. It will not go to any one Department and that is the way it should be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton asked if any search was made for other would be suitors. An intensive search was made. I would like to pay tribute to Mr. Ed O'Connell who has been chairman of INPC for a number of years. He is one of the most excellent civic minded people I have met in a long time. He knows how to run a company satisfactorily. He goes about his business in a professional way. He and the board, and successive boards, have been strong on doing the best for the business they had under their care. That also goes for the employees. I have been to the company twice and I have never been in such a work environment in which there is an ease of manner between employers and employees and in which the work in hand is tackled with relish and enthusiasm, but most of all that easy relationship has been a significant force in creating a positive work environment.</P>
    <P>INPC searched for possible suitors for a year and other likely suitors emerged, but in the end Tosco appeared to be the best. The chairman of the company came to me with details of that about 15 months ago and last August the Government arranged that we would go ahead with intensive negotiations with Tosco, which INPC did.</P>
    <P>Deputy Joe Higgins voiced strong concerns about the record of Tosco in the US and other matters relating to the environment and to safety records. The same management and employees will run INPC the morning after the closing date of the sale in mid-July as run it now, subject to HSA rules and what is laid down by the Environmental Protection Agency. There will not be new management or employees at any time as a guarantee of employment has been given to the staff. I wish to address that point because Deputies O'Malley and Stanton spoke about it.</P>
    <P>While a written guarantee of employment has been given to the staff, the Deputies might ask what that is worth and say it is only a piece of paper. It is, however, a formal document in which Mr. O'Malley from Tosco gave a guarantee of 15 years' employment to staff with the same conditions of employment as appertain now. Considering that ISPAT gave a commitment of five years' employment, a guarantee of 15 years employment is reasonably steady and forward looking.</P>
    <P>Tosco intends to develop the site. Deputy Stanton raised that point last night. Tosco has said that this is just the beginning. I am always wary in such circumstances. I cannot say, hand on heart, that anything wrong would never happen here or that a member of staff would never be let go from this employment. We got a formal <Col N="1113" /> document signed by the chief executive officer of Tosco following intense negotiation between it and the INPC and Government officials and one goes along with that in the belief that it is as strong as one can get at the time.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, it is interesting that Mr. O'Malley, the chief executive officer of Tosco, was the originator of that company in difficult circumstances. When a swift and clear strategic policy directive had to be given, he gave it. The insight he gave us of how he had to eventually get that done was interesting. He is also keen on playing golf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy's handicap is or how they manage such things in the States. Mr. O'Malley comes here six times a year and, therefore, has a strong connection with the country. I know that sentiment does not come into arrangements, rather it is business that features.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stanton asked about the details of the ESOP. It is being voted on and the union leaders have recommended it to their members. It remains to be seen what they will say. I will not view the end-game until that happens because they have a right to their ballot and I am sure it is a secret one. The figure is an average of £30,000 per person, but I am sure that will depend on length of service or whatever is the appertaining criteria. I do not know what it is exactly because I do not enter the discussions on such matters nor do I wish to know the details of what the union worked out. It worked out an average figure and I do not know on what it is based. It was worked out with the chairman of the INPC and its chief executive, Paddy Power, a very fine person. He is an excellent chief executive who has been in constant touch with the unions. The chairman came to see me and then the Minister for Finance with the arrangements regarding the average figure of £30,000. As to the breakdown of that and who among the 234 employees will get what, I do not know, nor is it my job to know that.</P>
      <P>It is in Tosco's best interests to ensure that there will be commercial viability, development works and a future for this refinery. Tosco has gone into this for purely strategic purposes. It wanted to purchase this refinery. The talks that went on for more than 12 months tell the tale of intense and, at times, testy negotiations which yielded the result arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reserves are not included in the deal. Responsibility for those will rest with National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA. If and when this legislation goes through and the sale goes through, we will then deal with NORA, a semi-State body. It comes under the heading of sustainable energy which is currently the source of legislation. Since that legislation has not yet been worked through, it would be suitable to include it in it. NORA remains what Ireland needs, a repository of necessary strategic stocks. They will <Col N="1114" /> enable us to withstand anything that might come our way in terms of dangers in the pipeline, which we do not envisage but about which one can never know. The retention of NORA as a semi-State body with its strategic stocks is important.</P>
    <P>The land involved is 140 acres. It is a bonus to have the land in reserve as it will facilitate expansion at the refinery. If any of the farmers or other people in the area wish to approach Tosco they can do so. That will be up to them.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 are related to amendment No. 1. Is it agreed that we discuss amendments Nos. 1, 9, 10 and 11 together? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;current market prices' means the current price at which the product is offered by a refining company to a customer and is based on an appropriate international index for the calculation of petroleum product prices;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is a pity we are rushing this Bill through the House. It is important legislation and we should have more time to discuss it and tease out the issues. Where the small operators are concerned, being able to source supply from the national refinery at Whitegate is essential to their ability to compete with the major oil companies. The national refinery has given Irish owned companies the opportunity to offer real competitive choice to customers. We are really trying to draw attention to the need for this to continue.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister stated in her Second Stage speech that this cannot be guaranteed. Basically we are saying that it is important that the small companies would not be squeezed out and these amendments have been tabled to draw attention to the need to ensure that would not happen. The Minister has said she feels this would not be the case in a commercial environment and that an oil refining company would sell to everybody who has money to buy product, but it is important that we discuss these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of ways in which a large <Col N="1115" /> company could exclude smaller companies if it wished to do so. Perhaps this is covered by other laws on competition. It was interesting that a little while ago the Minister stated that an application has been made for clearance from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and perhaps the Minister will tell us the standing of that application. If I heard correctly what she said in her reply on Second Stage, the response of the Department is still awaited. I would be interested to know has she any indication from the Department or the Competition Authority as to the standing of that application.</P>
    <P>She also mentioned something about EU assurances which had been sought or made available but she seemed a little wishy-washy on that matter. Perhaps she would state clearly that there is no problem in this regard where the Competition Authority, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the European Union are concerned. Could she also tell us if these bodies have any role in ensuring that the smaller oil companies are protected and what that role might be? If she could give us details of that role, it would be quite useful.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 is designed to ensure that current market prices would apply as decided by &ldquo;an appropriate international index for the calculation of petroleum product prices&rdquo;. As the Minister will be aware, there are such indices. This, in conjunction with the other amendments, would ensure that the new owners of the refinery could not squeeze out a selected company of either Irish or foreign origin. I would be interested to hear in the Minister's reply if the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has given cast-iron guarantees at this stage regarding the competitive nature of this deal and if the EU authorities are fully on board.</P>
    <P>The first part of amendment No. 9, which contains a number of parts, ensures that any company that refines oil into petroleum products within the State shall make available its output for sale within the State at current market prices at the time.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to this, first, that it will make the product available and, second, that it will make it available at a competitive current market price.</P>
    <P>The second part of amendment No. 9 ensures that the products being sold will &ldquo;be allocated on a non-discriminatory basis to all companies seeking such product and have regard to traditional off take proportions among companies purchasing product.&rdquo;. This will ensure that no company is squeezed out. Perhaps there is something in current legislation which provides for such guarantees.</P>
    <P>The third part of amendment No. 9 states that any company that refines oil into petroleum products in the State shall in so far as it is capable ensure that a sufficient range and quantity of products is produced, or capable of being produced to meet national strategic fuel needs at a <Col N="1116" /> given time, with due regard to the national profile or fuel consumption within the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have no difficulty in accepting these amendments. If the company is coming in here in good stead, as I am almost certain it is, then there should be no difficulty inserting these amendments in the legislation. They just copper-fasten what the Minister said will happen anyway.</P>
    <P>In the event of a dispute arising between companies and the refinery, it would be important that there would be some form of arbitration in place. We are endeavouring to draw attention to this in amendment No. 10. I am not aware of the existence of any such arbitration at present. If the Minister has information in this regard, will she make it available?</P>
    <P>The amendment sets out who might be the arbitrator. As usual, the arbitrator should be acceptable to both parties to the dispute or perhaps a person nominated by the Law Society of Ireland who would be acceptable to both parties. That would also have the effect of heading off problems and difficulties which might occur should such a dispute arise.</P>
    <P>In the event of failure to comply with these sections, there obviously should be some form of sanction and we provided for that in amendment No. 11. Perhaps the Minister has views on changing those provisions or perhaps there are guarantees already in place which can be enforced of which we are unaware, but it is important that the interests of the small indigenous Irish companies would be protected. As I have said, I am almost sure this will be the case anyway but I would like to hear the Minister say so. One of the reasons these amendments have been tabled is they give the Minister an opportunity to address the points and let us know the exact position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Stanton and Jim Higgins for tabling those amendments. These amendments were tabled at the behest of Tedcastles, a company operating in the oil market. I fully accept that people have a right to lobby and to put forward their point of view. The company in question put forward its point of view to me and to the Department, but obviously any such points of view are put to the office of the Attorney General and to the Department's legal advisers.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10 would place an artificial restriction on the commercial freedom of the new owners &ndash; or the current owners &ndash; who will operate to the highest standards in a commercial environment. Deputies will be aware that under legislation I am remarkably free to accept amendments and I have done so in many cases in both Houses of the Oireachtas, but clearly these are entirely unsuitable and I certainly would not be able to accept them. Rather than placate Deputy Stanton with soft words, I must say that it would be entirely incorrect of me to accept any of these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> It would amount to an unjustified restriction to supply goods and services on the part of the purchaser and would be against the free movement of goods and services set out in Article 29 of the relevant EU treaty. Apart from that it would be wrong, because of the need for commercial freedom, to tie down Tosco Corporation to adhere to the needs of one company. People have the right to lobby but our advice from the Attorney General and our legal sources indicates it would not be possible to tie down the company in this way, even at the behest of such an eminent company as Tedcastles Oil Products Limited, for which I have high regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to specifying compliance with arbitration, people can have recourse to the Arbitration Acts if they wish. The State does not force anybody into arbitration because it is a voluntary act. If parties do not agree to it they can go to court. There is no compulsion on any firm to comply with arbitration. It would not be possible to include that in any legislation. In view of this, the amendment dealing with fines to be imposed arising from the failure to take up arbitration falls. I like introducing, considering and amending legislation, but I cannot accept these amendments as legally they do not stand up.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other matter raised by Deputy Stanton, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment advised yesterday that it had been brought to the attention of the Competition Authority which agreed that existing competition legislation would afford all necessary legislative remedy should the proposed new owner of the facilities attempt to abuse its position or act in an uncompetitive manner. The same advice was offered by the Office of the Attorney General and our legal advisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is useful to know that. This is a very important matter for the company mentioned by the Minister and other companies. I see no reason a company like Tosco Corporation should exclude companies. It is in the business of making money. Nevertheless, we must debate these issues when they are brought to our attention.</P>
      <P>If I understand the Minister correctly, she has no fears that the smaller companies will not be excluded in any way. Will she put that on the record? Will she clarify the EU position? She mentioned assurances. Will she be more specific about them?</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>
        <b>:</b> I move amendment No. 2<i>a</i>:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&ndash;(1) The Minister shall not sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any of the shares held by the Minister in the Corporation to any potential purchaser without first conducting a thorough environmental audit of the potential purchaser's environmental record in this and in any other jurisdiction where it has operated.</P>
      <P>(2) The Minister shall not sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or any of the shares held by the Minister in the Corporation to any potential purchaser that has been in serious breach of health and safety laws in this or in any jurisdiction outside the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept the amendment &ndash; there is no reason it should not be accepted &ndash; and that it is also supported by the other Opposition parties. The purpose of the amendment is to protect our environment and ecosystems from predatory oil corporations and to protect the health and safety of the workers employed by them and other citizens or residents in close proximity to the facility.</P>
      <P>In her reply to Second Stage, the Minister treated the points I made in a totally flippant fashion. She did not respond to the points about the health and safety record of Tosco Corporation which, as I said, is disastrous. It obviously cut corners and a failure on the part of the management of the corporation was responsible for the tragedies in California. The report by the investigating authority, the United States Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, stated in relation to the 1999 disaster that management had responsibility to ensure that work was halted when it became clear that it was proceeding in a dangerous fashion. It also stated that worker error was not a root cause of the accident and that a satisfactory management system is one that anticipates that humans will inevitably make mistakes but still ensures the safe conduct of work. Effective job planning, hazard review and management oversight could have prevented the Avon tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, this tragedy, which cost the lives of four workers, occurred after another incident a year or two previously that involved similar management failure. There is a <Col N="1120" /> chronic pattern of cutting corners to maintain high profits. The Minister proposes to hand a facility in Ireland over to a corporation that is guilty of criminal negligence. She must reply to these points.</P>

        <b>:</b> The Minister referred to another Mr. O'Malley who is obviously a principal in the corporation. Health and safety are not jocose matters. Since those explosions, Tosco was taken over by Phillips Corporation, an even bigger multinational company which also has a disastrous safety record.</P>
      <P>Phillips refuses to enter into a safety contract with the trade union concerned, the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union. If the Minister intends to pursue the sale to this corporation, she must get safety guarantees from it. It is not sufficient to say that the same management and employees will remain in place. It is up to the oil corporation that takes over to decide what management will be put in place. The Minister cannot say that the same management will be in place for the next 15 years or that it will be in a position to maintain the same health and safety record and procedures that obtained when the operation was in public ownership. She must take serious cognisance of the health and safety record of Tosco Corporation and its parent company, Phillips Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that Deputies from west Cork in particular did not look more closely at the environmental record of Tosco Corporation. A wonderful natural resource is located in the vicinity of the facility that will be handed over to the corporation. Bantry Bay has a wealth of fishing and it is important in tourism terms not only to the people of west Cork, but to people from the rest of the country and abroad who are made welcome there. A corporation that is given responsibility for such a sensitive industry should at least have a perfect record with regard to environmental protection and related areas in its previous activities in other jurisdictions. However, Tosco Corporation has been an environmental disaster. It has contributed to a disastrous situation in San <Col N="1121" /> Francisco Bay. Numerous reports bear that out and numerous leading politicians, who could not in any way be accused of being socialists, have pointed out the disastrous role that Tosco, among others, played. In the case of Santa Monica, it then tried to walk away.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party will agree to my amendment that a potential purchaser should be subjected to a thorough environmental audit of its environmental record in this or any other jurisdiction. It is being given the management of a facility where the same slipshod approach to the environment that was taken in San Francisco Bay might be implemented in Bantry Bay. If that happened, the fishing community, the farming community and the tourism industry would suffer grievous damage.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the company and the Department carried out due diligence tests and I am sure environmental considerations were part of those tests. Tosco had some trouble with the chemical MTBE in San Francisco and perhaps the Minister could give me some information on it and whether the company intends to use it in Ireland. It is an additive about which there are worries. Can the Minister find out if it is in use at Whitegate?</P>
      <P>The other issue concerns the link with the Phillips Corporation. Some ask the reason we should not wait until the takeover of Tosco by Phillips is completed. I understand the Phillips Corporation is anxious to develop exploration in Alaska. This raises environmental considerations and concerns regarding the Kyoto agreement. The Minister of State yesterday expressed his concern about our obligations to the agreement, which is partly concerned with fossil fuels.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned linking the National Oil Reserves Agency with the sustainable energy authority which is to be established. As there may be a conflict of interest, I urge the Minister to look at the proposal again.</P>

      <P>Everyone has environmental concerns. When I met Mr. O'Malley, the head of Tosco, recently we spoke about environmental matters. On the same occasion I spoke with Mr. Paddy Power, the chief executive of the INPC. Mr. O'Malley told me about the 1998 accident in California. He went through Tosco's record in some detail. While the accident was a very sad one, the company's record on a league table of environmental and health and safety matters is extremely good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United States is a different country. The <Col N="1122" /> company will be operating in east Cork and subject to the EPA and the Health and Safety Authority. The management and employees of the company will be largely the same as those of the INPC. The laws to which the company must adhere are the laws of this country, not the United States. Irish environmental and health and safety laws are very rigorous and demand that companies operate to a very high standard. I do not know the standard of such laws in the United States but I venture to say the standard here is much higher. Any multinational company coming into Ireland knows it must operate to Irish health and safety standards.</P>
    <P>On the same occasion I inquired about the health and safety regime in the INPC and was assured it is very strong. Staff are trained in these areas, they attend seminars and members of staff give advice to other staff members. Standards are closely adhered to. Over many years, Departments and successive Ministers have given leadership in the area of health and safety and environmental protection in places of employment.</P>
    <P>I accept that Deputy Higgins has genuine concerns and have answered his amendment in good faith. Deputy Stanton asked about an additive. I do not know if the additive to which he referred is being used but will I inquire for him. He also asked about the link between Tosco and Phillips. Phillips is aware of Tosco's involvement with the INPC and fully satisfied with it.</P>

        <b>:</b> We are about to involve one of the country's essential facilities with an extremely unsavoury oil corporation. The corporation has had intimate dealings with the Indonesian regime while the most horrific repression and massacres were being carried out routinely in East Timor. In 1989, weeks after a massacre, the corporation made a contract with the Indonesian Government for oil off the Timor Gap. These are the people to whom the Minister is about to hand over a crucial facility.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not worry about giving this crucial facility to a corporation which will not be under State control and can close down operations if the world economy goes into recession, as happened with Irish Steel? Bantry, Cork and Ireland are mere blips in this corporation's world and it can turn its back on us as quickly as not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must inquire as to the chemicals to be used. I have a report from Reuters, dated 21 June 2000, which refers to the chemical about which Deputy Stanton spoke. The report makes the point that the chemical, which was thought to have been a component of clean burning gasoline, <Col N="1123" /> has been disastrous environmentally and caused the disastrous damage to the water system in Santa Monica. The Governor of California has banned its use from 2002. We must know what we are dealing with and what will be dealt with around our shores.</P>
    <P>The Minister is putting faith in a company whose record does not warrant such faith. How can she stand over the health and safety or environmental record of this company, bearing in mind the chapter and verse I have quoted? Can I take it she is accepting my amendment?</P>

      <P>Private companies come to Ireland for one reason, that is, to make profit. We have rules and regulations to ensure they do not damage our environment and that they provide proper working conditions for their employees. The Environmental Protection Agency enforces the environmental aspects of our regulations. Companies regard environmental and other concerns as a nuisance and a hindrance to their making profit but our high standards must be adhered to. For these high standards we can be partly thankful to the European Union whose particularly high standards with regard to the oil industry are applicable here.</P>
      <P>We also have planning and licensing legislation. There are very real controls on any company, regardless of how immoral or unsavoury it might have been elsewhere, that wants to operate in Ireland. I am satisfied that the proposal before us will be confined by the licensing and other arrangements.</P>
      <P>As regards the poisonous chemical used to clean petrol, benzene, it is now known to be carcinogenic. It probably did a lot more harm to humans than the lead that was previously in petrol. If benzene is used to unlead the petrol one would be better off with lead. Scientists did that rather than the chemical companies.</P>

      <P>Due diligence was carried on over the past 12 months since the protracted talks began. The environmental records are on a league table in the US. As I and Deputy Stagg have said, whatever the record in another country when a company comes in here it must observe the laws of this land. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Health and Safety Authority legislation is equal to any in Europe and is extremely rigorous. There is no question of a company coming from another country or continent and not being subject to the environmental and health and safety concerns and planning regulations that appertain in this country. A company cannot bring its baggage with it and expect to be able to do what it did in another country. The European influence under the social contracts entered into with it in the area of health and safety, the EPA and so on, is one of the finer points of our EU involvement. Many firms grumbled as each of these was introduced but now they are proud of our record in that regard.</P>

        <b>:</b> The problem is that there is an environmental protection organisation in the US and Tosco was found to be in defiance of its regulations on many occasions. In one of its facilities around San Francisco Bay in 1999 tests found from its smoke stacks dioxin levels 20 times that which should have been the limit. It was under the control of the EPA. I do not expect multinational corporations to be moral or anything else but I am astounded that this Government, backed by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, should be prepared to hand over to immoral corporations, quite clearly guilty of many environmental and political transgressions, a crucial industry. It is astounding that the Labour Party in particular is strongly supporting the Minister in this regard when there was an alternative. It could have been kept in public ownership and it could have extended into exploration for natural gas and oil around the coast instead of handing that over to other multinationals.</P>

Will the Minister give an assurance that is the case?

      <P>&ldquo;7. (1) Notwithstanding any provision in the memorandum or articles of association of the Agency or any enactment to the contrary, the Minister may, with the prior approval of the Minister for Finance, by order direct the Agency to transfer any or all of its assets or liabilities or both, including petroleum, to the Minister or other public authority on such terms and conditions as the Minister thinks fit and, where appropriate, more than one such transfer may be so ordered.</P>

      <P>(3) Amounts (if any) paid by the Minister in respect of a transfer directed under <i>subsection (1)</i>or <i>(2)</i> shall be repaid to the Central Fund out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>(4) Stamp duty shall not be chargeable on any instrument under which stocks or marketable securities of the Agency are transferred to the Minister or other public authority.</P>
      <P>(5) In this section 'other public authority' means&ndash;</P>
      <P>a)a Minister of the Government other than the Minister,</P>
      <P>b)a body established by or under statute, other than a company incorporated under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990,</P>

    <P>c)a company incorporated under the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1999, in which all the shares are held by or on behalf of, or by directors <Col N="1128" /> appointed by, a Minister of the Government, or</P>
    <P>d)a company to which paragraph (<i>c</i>) does not relate in which all the shares are held directly or indirectly by one or more of the following:</P>

    <P>(iii) one or more than one company to which <i>paragraph (c)</i> relates.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is in two sections. It provides for certain matters that may need to be addressed in relation to any future restructuring, particularly the future ownership and assets, of the National Oil Reserves Agency. Deputy Stanton raised that question a few months ago. The overall purpose of the section is to facilitate the winding down of the INPC group and to provide for the transfer of the shares or assets to another State-owned entity. The precise manner in which the proposed restructuring will take place remains to be determined.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a number of options which may or may not be exercised depending upon the circumstances prevailing at the time that NORA is being restructured and to where it is going.

      <P>I thank the Chair. That is very useful. I am a little annoyed that all this is happening in one go, Second, Committee and Report Stages. It is not the best way to deal with legislation.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies have alluded to the fact that a sale and purchase agreement has actually been entered into and that the purpose of this legislation, as I said on Committee Stage, is to put it into effect. We have not seen this agreement. Tonight and last night and in the joint committee certain issues have come to our notice of which we were not previously aware. There may be others about which we do not know. As Deputies and public representatives, we should know about them.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to change the Title of the Bill to give equal weight to what the Minister and we are doing to provide that the Minister may guarantee certain obligations of the corporation pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement. The Minister has alluded to the fact that some of them go on forever. We are tying the State into obligations that will last <i>saecula saeculorum . </i>Perhaps further legislation will be drafted in years to come in order to change this. As matters stand tonight, that is the situation. I wanted to draw attention to this by putting it in the Title and saying to the Minister that we should have seen the sale and purchase agreement on which we should have been briefed in greater detail. I do not say this to be critical but rather by way of information because in some ways the House is becoming a rubber-stamp. More time is needed for critical examination and comment. This amendment would not change the content of the Bill in any way or make any major difference to it, except to highlight this particular situation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;current market prices' means the current price at which the product is offered by a refining company to a customer and is based on an appropriate international index for the calculation of petroleum product prices;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage when we thrashed it out in detail. It has to do with smaller companies. There are two reasons <Col N="1132" /> the mandatory regime was imposed. One was that when the major companies decided that they were going to walk away and not purchase, the Government of the time had to compel them to purchase in order to keep the refinery going. The second was to raise funds in order to subsidise, for want of a better word, the operation of the refinery. If the major companies were to decide to do the same thing again, to bypass the refinery and not purchase from it under this new regime, where would that leave it? What could the Government do to keep it in operation? If a new owner was to decide that there were no customers for the product, where would that leave the refinery? I am sure the Government has addressed this question but it is one I would like to see addressed. The smaller companies would be very vulnerable if that turned out to be the case. There are facilities at Whitegate, including a very valuable road loading facility which means that ships can come inshore and the product can be distributed through the refinery into tankers. It is a very important facility which &ndash; the Minister can correct me if I am wrong &ndash; could be unique. It is a sort of monopoly and very valuable. Would companies continue to use it in the future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember being responsible for the INPC in the brief I held in the Department. I remember agreeing to provide funding to extend the road loading facilities at the request of the companies which were buying the product. It is not a case of a product coming from a ship to this facility, it is to pipe the facility from the large tanks. Lorries can drive in and load from it. It is from the product created by the manufacture of oil and petrol by the refinery itself. It comes directly from ships. My understanding is that what comes from ships is crude which is refined.</P>

      <P>The amendments tabled are those we discussed on Committee Stage. The comments made then appertain now, that is, that it would be a commercial operation and would seek to operate commercially, to make money and to provide a service if it was viable to do so. The Deputy asked what happens if it does not deal with a particular company. The normal rules of commerce and trade would apply in such instances. Deputy Stanton asked also in the event that Tosco refused to deal with a particular company if the State would have any say on what on it should do. The State would not have any say in that because it would have become a fully commercial company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. If after the sale Tosco decide not to purchase, where does that leave the refinery? Could it be downgraded? In that case the smaller companies which are purchasing from the refinery would not have anywhere to source their product. With fewer companies in the market competition could be affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Tosco's purpose is to make money and not to run down the facility. If it is operate commercially and economically it will do the business. In a market economy that is the regime in which we live. I am sure it will want to do the business and will want to deal with the firms in question or any others that come on stream. I can give no other answer because that is the actual position. There are rules of competition here as well as rules of commerce and business and consumer protection, all of which are law so that people would have recourse to directives and legislation.</P>

      <P>We have the National Oil Reserves Agency. Tosco is a commercial operation. There is no further answer I can give. The State would not have a role in it. However the State does have a role in keeping strategic stocks.

      <P>In page 6, line 10, to delete &ldquo;Subject to <i>paragraph (b),</i> the&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;The&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the matter we were discussing when we were stopped on Committee Stage. It is about the guarantee for the future. We were anxious that a time limit would be put on it where the State was concerned. It has been mentioned on a number of occasions that the State will be responsible for the jetty in <i>saecula saeculorum. </i> Why is that the case? We were in the middle of getting an explanation from the Minister on what exactly the environmental problems would be at Whitegate. The Minister mentioned, if I recall correctly, that the purpose of Auto Oil I and II was to upgrade the refinery. My understanding is that this particular environmental guarantee that the State is entering into relates to events that occurred prior to the takeover of the refinery by Tosco and anything that happens from now on such as the Auto Oil II project will be Tosco's problem. What exactly are the problems covered by this guarantee? Will the Minister be specific about it? With all due respect, to say it is environmental problems is vague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The environmental problems are the normal problems associated with a refinery. I would not have the precise knowledge but I know enough, as would the Deputy who comes from the area, to know that there would always be environmental concerns wherever there had been or continues to be an oil refinery. It is to the credit of INPC that it has managed the environment extraordinarily well and that the concerns of residents and those who work in the industry have been well met and managed. By its nature an oil refinery could have environmental hazards associated with it which are not yet apparent. If and when they become apparent the State is liable for the amelioration of those hazards prior to the date of purchase and sale. If those hazards can be shown to have been couched in a prior time Tosco would be liable for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is extremely clear. We know exactly what the Minister is talking about but we still have not got a specific description of what any one of these hazards might be. I will not go any further with it but it is unsatisfactory that the Minister says what any one of these things might be and yet the State is asked to guarantee up to <Col N="1135" /> $75 million. As Deputy Stagg asked, why is the figure in dollars? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not be used and might not be needed. The hazards might not materialise but the very nature of the business should show that.</P>
      <P>The chairman advises me that it will take out a capping insurance that will render it liable to a certain amount. We are taking the extreme view in this. Those hazards may not come to pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said earlier that tests were carried out to determine these hazards. Is $75 million plucked from the air?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It came from the advisers who in turn hired professional people such as surveyors and environmental experts. They came up with that figure. However, that figure may not be used. I remember answering a question from Deputy Stanton last October and I told him that the environment was the major issue and that we were determined that the environment would be addressed correctly because this will affect the whole neighbourhood and the people for generations. It is only right that it be properly provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy might even get us closer to that at some time in the future. There is a good reason to have an insurance policy of a certain amount of money such as this. There are rules of thumb for arriving at it for old sites that might have a hidden environmental problem that might not be immediately apparent. For example the site where the old gasometer was in Dublin was found to be peppered with mercury from the operation of the gasometer. There was a huge <Col N="1136" /> environmental cost arising from the need to seal that site. That was not apparent until they dug up that site. I presume this is there, given that this is an old site that has been operating for a long time. I have a painting in my office of the site before there was a refinery there at all. It was painted by the daughter of the previous owner and there was a lovely house on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&ndash;The purchaser shall provide to third parties, on a non discriminatory basis and on reasonable commercial terms, jetty facilities at Whitegate and Whiddy Island in so far as such facilities are not reasonably needed for the purchaser's activities at any time.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that this is important because of the monopoly situation in regard to the road loading and jetty facilities in Whitegate in the <Col N="1138" /> absence of any other similar facility in the country. This facility is currently controlled by a semi-State company. I understand that it is possible to bring in refined product, although I am not totally sure of that. Perhaps the Minister will comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of the facilities at Whiddy is very important for local people. As the Minister is aware, a ferry was purchased with a view to facilitating local people travelling to and from the island. A small pier was also provided to facilitate the loading of cattle onto the boat owned by the terminal. I am, of course, referring to Whiddy rather than Whitegate. This may be a small part of the agreement but it is very important to local people. Quite a head of steam built up on the issue at one stage and the then chief executive, Fergus Cahill, resolved it by providing the ferry to which I have referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty with amendment No. 8 is that it would tie the hands of the incoming operator. One can assume that if an incoming company wants to remain on good terms with its neighbours, it would deal with them reasonably in relation to the existing facilities. However, I would not like to tie the company's hands in advance of the deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there are some families living on Whiddy and there are other issues involved. At other locations where property has been purchased between the foreshore and the public road, new owners have sometimes restricted access to beaches and the foreshore. Similar issues may arise in the situation we are discussing, but in the absence of sight of the purchase and sale agreement, we are not sure what it contains. Those are important issues for people living in Whiddy and for current commercial users of both jetties and terminals. Can the Minister do anything about this, or has the issue been considered? I understand the Minister's comment that we cannot tie the hands of the new owners, but can we exclude people or are there rights of way for residents? Is there a possibility of a long legal wrangle on this issue? I am simply looking at the worst case scenario.</P>
      <P>With regard to the jetty and road loading facilities at Whitegate, my amendment would allow third parties to use them on reasonable commercial terms. I am conscious of the possibility that people from Tosco and others are watching and noting what we are saying. I take the Minister's point that the new owners will want to be good neighbours, as INPC has been for a long time. I am not sure of the best way to proceed. I understand the need to avoid tying the hands of a new owner through this legislation but, at the same time, there are issues which the Minister may have to revisit. There is merit in dealing with this kind of issue in Committee in the Dáil. Perhaps we should make more use of committees to tease out such issues.</P>

      <P>I believe the Government should accept amendment No. 8 in the names of Deputy Stanton and Deputy Jim Higgins. I am really amazed at the depth of generosity with which the Government feels that this multinational company can be credited. I wonder why the Minister is extending all the latitude to the oil corporation purchaser and not to the local people. She does not want to tie the hands of Tosco Corporation and therefore she is prepared to leave the local people to the vagaries of what Tosco may or may not decide in that regard. The residents who need those facilities should have their access guaranteed. Once they are controlled by Tosco Corporation, if this shameful deal goes through, the local people will be at a disadvantage. If Tosco decides not to be generous, all the nice words from the Minister, or from anybody else, are worth nothing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.&ndash;(1) In the event that the purchaser or a future owner deciding to cease the refining of oil products at the Whitegate Oil Refinery then the owner at that time will offer to the State the full control and ownership of the facility.</P>
      <P>(2) With reference to <i>subsection (1)</i> if the Minister declines an offer made then the owner will, within 12 months, work to revert the site to a green field situation to the satisfaction of the Minister.</P>
      <P>If the new owner, or any owner in the future, decides to close the refinery and not to continue using it as an oil refinery, two things could happen. For the past number of years the oil refinery has been quite an important strategic facility for the State. If an owner decided to close the refinery, as happened a number of years ago, there should be some provision where the State would have the option to regain control and ownership of the facility. Suppose the majors, as Deputy Stagg said, decided not to take refined products from the refinery and the small companies were not around, we would be in trouble if the oil refinery was to close. If this happened in the future &ndash; we hope it never happens &ndash; there should be provision in the legislation where the company would turn the whole shooting match over to the State.</P>

In regard to the secret agreement with Tosco Oil, it is quite outrageous that the supposed representatives of the people do not know under what conditions it has been agreed to dispose of this vital facility to a multinational corporation. We are supposed to agree that the legislation be put through the House. I agree with amendment No. 12. It is quite clear the Government, in the event of the multinationals deciding to go to more profitable fields elsewhere because their plans and strategy change, should have the possibility of having control over what is an important resource. We hope in the future energy will move on to much cleaner and more environmentally friendly means than oil but, nevertheless, at this time, the economy and society are quite dependent on oil. What the Government is doing is quite reckless and the main Opposition parties are agreeing with it to give complete control of this vital section of the economy to a multinational.

Regarding the idea that this was done behind closed doors, everybody at that committee was free to ask questions, and I presume they did. Everybody was free to ask questions during this Dáil debate. This was not a secret deal done behind closed doors. There are commercial matters and we will open a data room and all the matters connected with this sale will be available for anybody to see. The Bill to authorise the sale of INPC to Tosco is that which we are discussing, and have discussed since 7 o'clock this evening. The idea that people disappeared into a room and closed the door is not correct. The employees were very much involved and they came to see me in February. They had also been in early in the autumn. In February, they asked for much more precise information. We telephoned the chief executive officer and chairman and asked that they receive as much information as possible, and they did.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 12, Tosco has agreed to 15 years. It would not be legally possible for me to place that condition upon the sale, that is, that I would ask the company to give the refinery back to the State. Is that what the Deputy is asking? </P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue and thank the Minister for being here to respond.</P>
      <P>The issue pertains to the closure and threatened closure of a number of post offices in the Dublin area. I refer particularly to the recent closure of Terenure post office and those on Merrion Street and Baggot Street, as well as the threatened closure of Donnybrook post office. All are in my own constituency but it is reflective of a wider trend. Will the Minister state if there is a plan in place for the future development of these post offices and others throughout the country? </P>
      <P>The closure and threatened closure of these post offices in Dublin villages diminishes, yet again, locally based services for people in the areas concerned. The quality of life for local people is adversely affected by closures. It is distressing for many residents to see their local post office closing. This was certainly the case in Terenure where there is a strong feeling that the service should remain available to them. The closure of the post offices means that people have to travel further and further to avail of these basic services in an already gridlocked city.</P>
      <P>I understand a number of reports are being considered by the Minister's Department with regard to the future of the post offices, if a report in yesterday's <i>The Irish Times</i> is correct. It said that members of an interdepartmental group assessing funding options for the post office network have opposed payment of a State subsidy. Has any decision been taken in this regard and when will the Department make a decision on the future of post offices? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a suggestion in April that Irish banks should get involved in some form of subsidisation of local post offices. This is happening in the UK where an interesting scheme was developed to sustain the future of post office services. A rethink of the kind of services that can <Col N="1144" /> be offered by post offices is taking place. Does the Minster have a plan for this to happen here so it will be viable for the post offices to remain open? </P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs would have a view on the matter because they had a contract worth £35 million in 1999, and it is among the largest of An Post's corporate clients.</P>
    <P>If a decision on future funding has not been made, when does the Minster expect it? In the absence of such a decision, post offices close down. Judging by what is happening in south-east Dublin, we will see more and more closures. It is essential to decide what action is necessary to prevent this. I understand there are many practical difficulties concerning staffing and premises. However, if there is a viable plan that gives the post offices new tasks, and if the question of subsidy is addressed, a future can be guaranteed for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for raising this matter. The present Government policy, and that of the last, was that there should be no post office closures. However, vacancies arise due to death or illness, in which cases An Post advertises the posts twice and actively canvasses for suitable candidates. It is only when a suitable candidate for a vacancy cannot be found, despite advertising, that a post office is closed on a temporary basis, pending an application from such a person.</P>
      <P>In February last year, I requested Phil Flynn to carry out a review of the sub-post office network in the context of the Government's explicit commitment to the retention of the rural and urban post office networks. Regional and rural developments are cornerstones of this Government's economic and social development policy.</P>
      <P>Mr. Flynn's terms of reference were two-fold: first, to review the financial and business environment of the sub-post office network; second, to examine options and make recommendations on the sustainable development of the rural post office network. The facts in the report, which I sent to each Member, are stark. The company operates a network of offices, some of which are staffed by the company and some sub-contracted. The Flynn report outlines a wide range of scenarios, options and recommendations.</P>
      <P>On 4 April, the Government decided to establish an interdepartmental group to provide a blueprint for the future funding of the post office network. The group is comprised of senior officials who are engaged in a consultative process with relevant parties. The group will make recommendations to me arising from their assessment of the Flynn study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now at a crossroads regarding the network of post office counter services and I wish to <Col N="1145" /> ensure that I have the best advice available to Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to an important matter raised by Deputy Fitzgerald, we noticed in the English papers that the banks had provided to the UK and the post office network a large sum of money, the destination of which was post offices that had undertaken work previously done by banks. Yesterday, an official of the DTI in the UK came to visit the group to outline how that subsidisation came about, how much it was, and how much was given to individual post offices. I am assured the meeting was worthwhile and I hope to gain a more comprehensive account of it.</P>
    <P>Throughout the country, banks are pulling out of towns and villages. I am sure they have their commercial reasons for doing so. Increasingly, post offices will take on work done by banks. In that regard, banks have an obligation to pay appropriately for the services the post offices will undertake in turn. It is unfortunate that banks are pulling out and the committee is investigating the matter. I have made my suggestion. When I made that personal suggestion to the committee two months ago, the banks treated it with derision. We now find that the banks in the UK have come to an arrangement similar to what I sketched out. I hope the committee will find fertile ground in the debate it had yesterday with its counterpart from the DTI in the UK and that we will be able to approach the matter in this vein. The committee will report back to Government by the end of July.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leas Cheann-Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I raise the issue of developments at the breast cancer unit in Mayo General Hospital because it is of serious public concern in the county and in the region. It is also timely and appropriate that one should do so because the Estimates for the forthcoming budget are currently being prepared and will be discussed in greater detail over the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that in the Estimates speech given by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to a committee on 19 June a specific paragraph is inserted on symptomatic breast disease services. It states that the National Cancer Forum at the request of the Minister's predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, produced a report on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease, the report indicated a need to reorganise and develop breast disease services in centres of excellent to ensure that every effort is made to reduce the number of women in this country who die from breast cancer every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all support efforts to save lives and to provide as much safety as possible in the health area <Col N="1146" /> for everybody. This document that was referred to is not Government policy and was never intended to be. It is only a report. That report gave rise to serious agitation and concern in the western counties to the extent that the arguments contained in it about centralising services in locations far from rural areas could lead to further waiting lists, longer queues and a lessening of service. In the case of County Mayo the distances involved and the number of women who would be forced to travel to obtain the service demolish that argument.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children articulated Government policy on this matter in my presence, in the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, who comes from my county, other public representatives and representatives of the cancer support group from Mayo who represent all women in the county and the region. He articulated Government policy when he said that the Castlebar-Mayo General Hospital breast cancer unit would develop and expand in parallel with the specialist centre in Galway. What has happened in relation to that development? What number of extra staff has been approved? What moneys are to be allocated for the forthcoming year? How much of the £2.25 million allocated by the Department of Health and Children to the Western Health Board for disease services is to be spent in the Mayo breast cancer unit in Mayo General Hospital?</P>
    <P>It seems that the Western Health Board report is patently unclear as to a division of the £2.25 million allocated. I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, to clarify whether a much more sizeable proposal was submitted from the Western Health Board to his Department but was severely restricted and curtailed by officials in the Department of Health and Children to the point where there has been no great development of any significance at the breast cancer unit in Mayo General Hospital, contrary to the words of the Minister and his articulation of Government policy. I would like the Minister of State to clear this up this evening.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about this. Nurses, consultants and, most of all, the women of the western region are extremely concerned about it. I would like the Minister of State on behalf of the Minster for Health and Children and the Government to spell out clearly and to let the Dáil hear that there will be no strangulation of the service at the Mayo breast cancer unit and that there will be no diminution of it but that rather it will expand and develop as the Minister for Health and Children, on behalf of the Government, told us in public. I want to see that happen and I know the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, wants that also. He is in a position to influence this. I would like if he would articulate that view and confirm that position in the Dáil this evening.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I am pleased to have the opportunity afforded to me this evening by Deputy Kenny to inform the House of the current position on the development of specialist breast cancer services in the Western Health Board area. As the Deputy will be aware the provision of medical services at Mayo General Hospital is a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is also aware, at the request of the previous Minister for Health and Children, Minister Cowen, the National Cancer Forum established a sub-group to examine the provision of services for women with symptomatic breast disease. The sub-group had the following terms of reference &ndash; to assess the impact on the existing diagnostic services for benign and malignant breast disease in the light of the national breast cancer screening programme, the increase in the target population, the increased awareness of the importance of breast screening and the current and evolving technologies in the area of breast screening.</P>
      <P>The sub-group was also asked to make recommendations to the Minister for Health and Children on the diagnostic services for symptomatic breast disease necessary to meet projected increased needs; the need to develop associated services in radiotherapy, medical oncology, counselling and other support services; the resources required to develop these services and the principles that should underlie the organisation and delivery of services for breast disease.</P>
      <P>As part of the work of the sub-group, the regional directors of cancer services were asked for information concerning their current service and their views were sought on how the service should be developed in their region. In addition, three members of the sub-group visited each region. The consensus view regarding best practice in the management of breast disease was presented to regional representatives and their views on how this could be achieved in their region were sought.</P>
      <P>The sub-group found that although services should be delivered as close to the patient's home as is feasible, the overriding priority should be to provide the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and, in so doing, provide the best opportunity for long-term survival to those who are found to have breast cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children received the report of the Subgroup on the Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease and established an advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor Niall O'Higgins to assist the health boards in formulating their plans for the development of services for symptomatic breast disease. This group met with Western Health <Col N="1148" /> Board officials and clinicians following which the board considered the development of specialist breast disease services and adopted a plan for this development. This plan was submitted to the Department of Health and Children and is being considered and the Department will revert to the Western Health Board in due course.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the development of specialist breast disease services in the Western Health Board area is being actively considered within the Department and this involves services at Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar. I can also reassure him that we will seriously consider this matter in regard to what he said about the moneys that will be given to Castlebar and the continuity of the existing service there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. The background to this issue is that a planning application was lodged by Collen Brothers with Dublin Corporation for a major redevelopment of the Wiggins Teape complex on East Wall Road. There was extensive consultation between the East Wall Residents Association, the developers and Dublin Corporation's planning department. It was agreed by all concerned that the central section of the front facade along with the main entrance would be retained and integrated into the new development. This arrangement was seen as a reasonable compromise by the residents association and by local representatives, including myself. Planning permission was granted on that basis. A third party, however, appealed, as was his right, to An Bord Pleanála. The board then, in its wisdom, decided to refuse permission and stated in its decision that the board carefully weighed the arguments in relation to the significance of the Wiggins Teape building and concluded that the entire front portion of the building, including the forward elements of the side elevations, was worthy of retention and would be capable of being integrated satisfactorily into a new development on the site. However, it was the view of the board that this would require redesign of the development as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two days later, Collen Brothers, deliberately and in a calculated act of defiance of the findings of An Bord Pleanála, sent in the bulldozers in the early hours of the morning of Saturday, 16 June &ndash; Bloomsday &ndash; to demolish the frontage of the building that had just been described as being of architectural and historical significance. There is only one way to describe what was done &ndash; it was an act of despicable vandalism. Collen Brothers, the perpetrator of this destruction, is now rewarded with a cleared site with no obstacle of <Col N="1149" /> architectural value in the way of its redevelopment.</P>
    <P>However, its vandalism has drawn attention to the potential threat from unscrupulous developers hanging over many unlisted buildings in Dublin city. Steps must be taken to prevent this type of thing happening again. What is urgently required is a comprehensive survey of all buildings of merit in Dublin city. This would complement the national inventory of architectural heritage being compiled under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands throughout the country but, significantly, not in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The survey I propose could follow the inventory being compiled with European funding by the Historic Heart of Dublin, a joint venture between Dublin Corporation and the Civic Trust, which ends in June this year. This pilot scheme concentrated on a limited area of the city; the same inventory urgently needs to be carried out citywide. Neither the funds nor the personnel are available to Dublin Corporation to carry out a comprehensive survey. It would have to be State supported. Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate if the necessary resources will be granted to Dublin Corporation to deal with this important matter. The extremely able conservation officer and her assistant in Dublin Corporation are already working flat out and under severe pressure with responsibilities arising from the recent changes in planning legislation and over 9,000 protected structures in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>Other steps that could be taken to prevent further destruction or vandalism should include the introduction of some form of licensing or permit before any building of a significant size can be demolished. At present, no authorisation is required for buildings other than listed buildings, habitable houses and other exceptional circumstances. Surely a similar decision by An Bord Pleanála should imply a stay of execution on the demolition of buildings which the board considers to have special architectural merit, if only to give the planning authority time to react to the board's findings.</P>
    <P>The developer, Collen Brothers, which was responsible for this act, should be prosecuted for vandalism and anti-social behaviour. This type of irresponsible action, motivated solely by greed, should not be allowed go unpunished. I fail to see the difference between this act of appalling vandalism and any other. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should call in the Garda and prosecute the perpetrator for vandalism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. However, under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, the Mini<Col N="1150" /> ster is specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to an individual planning application or appeal with which An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.</P>
      <P>In this case, one of the reasons cited by the board for refusing permission for development on the site related to the architectural and historical significance of the front section of the building. In arriving at its decision, the board weighed the arguments in relation to the significance of the building and concluded that the entire front portion of the building was worthy of retention and would be capable of being integrated satisfactorily into a new development on the site.</P>
      <P>The law in relation to protection of our architectural heritage was substantially strengthened with the enactment of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, now consolidated in Part IV of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. The 1999 Act, which came into force on 1 January 2000, enhanced the powers of local authorities and increased the obligations on owners and occupiers of protected buildings. Under the Act, development plans must contain objectives for the preservation of buildings of architectural merit and all such buildings must be included in the record of protected structures to be contained in the development plan. The criteria for including a building in the record of protected structures are wide and include buildings of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest.</P>
      <P>The Act places a duty on owners and occupiers to protect such structures with a maximum fine for damaging a protected structure of £1 million, increased to £10 million under the 2000 planning Act. Save in exceptional circumstances, a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála may not grant permission for the demolition of a protected structure.</P>
      <P>The 1999 Act formed part of a comprehensive package of measures introduced jointly by my Department and Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to increase the protection of our architectural heritage. The latter Department was responsible for enactment of the Architectural Heritage (National Inventory) and Historic Monuments (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1999. In addition, my Department introduced a scheme of grants for the conservation of protected structures, worth approximately £4 million per year, together with funding for the appointment of conservation officers to assist local authorities in carrying out their functions under the planning Act. An additional £1 million annual funding was also supplied to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in respect of the national inventory of architectural heritage and its role in providing day to day guidance for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1999 planning Act, all buildings <Col N="1151" /> listed in a development plan prior to the coming into force of the Act were automatically deemed to be protected, subject to the owners and any occupier being given an opportunity to have their views considered. Also, a new procedure for adding buildings to or deleting buildings from the record of protected structures was provided for. The final decision as to whether a building should become a protected structure is a matter for the elected members.</P>
    <P>The strengthened provisions in the 1999 Act for the protection of our architectural heritage have placed considerable demands on local authorities. Initially this involved notification of the large number of owners and occupiers of previously listed buildings. In the process of identifying further buildings for possible inclusion in the record of protected structures, priority has generally been afforded to examination of pre-20th century buildings. With the enhanced resources available to local authorities as I have outlined, greater attention is now being given to identification of buildings of more recent vintage and I expect to see more 20th century buildings protected in local authority development plans.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the statutory provisions introduced under the 1999 Act and the package of supporting measures put in place provide a strong basis for the protection of our architectural heritage and, as a consequence, do not accept the need for a certification or licensing system along the lines suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every year since 1997 the publication of the sports capital programme has been extremely disappointing. For the first few years, sports clubs in Dublin and other urban regions received next to nothing as the Minister, Deputy McDaid, thought about new programmes and application forms.</P>
      <P>In the last two years many clubs in disadvantaged urban areas have once again been let down and are bitterly disappointed. A key element of the programme this year was that even if one's club was in a disadvantaged area, it had to have a minimum of 20% of the funding for the project. That meant, for example, a club seeking a development costing £200,000 had to have £40,000. However, if it had that amount of money, it probably would not have needed to apply for a lottery grant in the first place. It seems to me this element must be thought out again seriously by the Minister. Because of the 200 or so applications in the four Dublin council areas, about 80 were immediately marked ineligible &ndash; about 40% of the applications. It was a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is just part of a wider pattern of discrimination against the metropolitan regions. Dublin, for example, received only £7 million net &ndash; not <Col N="1152" /> £9.5 million, as the Minister stated &ndash; out of the £40 million for sport nationally. As we now know, none of the eight sports partnerships was allocated to Dublin Corporation, which deals with the most deprived areas.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Dublin North-East constituency is even worse. Despite the fact that it forms part of the disadvantaged North-side Partnership Area and recently got three areas in the RAPID Programme, we received a miserly total of £250,000 in funding out of the £40 million available.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the fact that Naomh Barróg, a fine GAA club in Kilbarrack, got £15,000 and the Dean Swift Sports Club in Clonshaugh got £100,000, the total amount we received seems derisory when compared with what other similar sized counties received. Counties Clare, Sligo and Louth, for example, received £708,000, £905,000 and £885,000, respectively, that is, almost £1 million each, and rightly so. They were probably entitled to £2 million but then so was Dublin North-East. Even counties such as Carlow, Roscommon and Laois, which have about half the population of my constituency, received £820,000, £850,000 and £943,000, respectively. I do not begrudge them those grants, but why did Dublin North-East get a derisory £250,000?</P>
    <P>If one looks through examples of the applications, there is one terrible disappointment for the people of Baldoyle. The magnificent Baldoyle United Football Club, which has been in existence for almost half a century, the famous green and white hoops of which are famous in all soccer leagues, is the only major sports club in the parish of Baldoyle which holds perhaps 12,000 or 13,000 people. Year in, year out, it looks after 600 young men and women. It liaises closely with, and provides a home for, our local senior citizens, who hope to visit me in this House next Wednesday. It also liaises closely with local schools. For the third year in a row, Baldoyle United has gone to the door of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, and has had it slammed in its face. This is outrageous.</P>
    <P>Dublin North-East is represented by three of the Minister's colleagues: a senior Fianna Fáil Minister, a Fianna Fáil Deputy and a Fianna Fáil Senator. Therefore, there are three Fianna Fáil representatives in the four-seat constituency. What is the use in having them at the end of the day if we get a miserable £250,000 pounds out of £40 million, when according to any fair allocation, we were entitled to at least £1 million? The Minister, Deputy McDaid, has failed us once again. He is an affable man, with whom I get on well, but he has let us down in the allocation of sports grants for the most vulnerable constituencies.</P>
    <P>Only a few weeks ago we watched him make the case on &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo; for the spending of £550 million, £600 million or, as many of my party colleagues believe, up to £1 billion to <Col N="1153" /> build the centre of sports excellence, Sports Campus Ireland, but eight miles along the M50, the children of Baldoyle United and many similar soccer clubs, boxing clubs and Gaelic football clubs will still have to tog out in ditches.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, as we enter the last nine or ten months of the Government's term of office, to look at providing a fair allocation of sports capital moneys throughout the country, particularly in my neck of the woods in Dublin North-East and in all the metropolitan areas which seem to do badly in comparison to other areas. On many occasions I have argued with the Minister, Deputy McDaid, that in any one year he could give each of the 42 constituencies perhaps £1.5 million or £2 million. A £40 million programme is useless. There should have been at least £60 million or perhaps £80 million. It would be preferable to provide a programme of that size for Dublin and the rest of the country rather than see the Government spend £1 billion on an illusion in memory of one man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter in the House this evening. The current Sports Capital Programme was reviewed in 1999. For the purposes of the review, particular attention was paid to the sports policy objective of trying to assist with the creation of opportunities for all to participate in sport and recreation through access to facilities and activities especially for young people in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The outcome of this review resulted in a number of objectives and criteria being established to focus the efforts of the programme in bringing the greatest benefit to where it is most needed. The main objectives of the programme are to develop an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities; to assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations which will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation; to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities and to encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by the clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications under the programme are assessed in accordance with several detailed criteria, which include the following: the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will increase the level of active participation in sport-recreational sport and-or result in improved standards of sporting performance and how such increases can be measured; the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the financial viability of the project; the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area and the current and planned <Col N="1154" /> levels of sport and-or recreational sports facilities in the area; and the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds and an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups.</P>
    <P>This year £40 million has been allocated under the programme and, of this amount, Dublin has received £9.5 million through the issue of 89 grants. Nationally, 370 disadvantaged projects were grant aided to the amount of £23.5 million and included in the total amount for Dublin is a figure of 58 grants amounting to £6 million for disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Grants under the scheme are not categorised or classified according to political constituencies, but by county. Assessment of the projects is in relation and comparison to all the other projects for that county. However, I can confirm that several projects have been allocated funding in the general area of Dublin North-East, for example, £200,000 to the North Dublin Schoolboys and Girls League; £150,000 to Naomh Barróg GAA Club; £150,000 to Craobh Chiaran GAA Club; £100,000 to Dean Swift Sports Club; £10,000 to St. Luke's Boxing Club; and £150,000 to St. Paul's College, Raheny.</P>
    <P>Generally in Dublin, it is clear from the allocations made under the 2001 Sports Capital Programme that organisations in disadvantaged areas of Dublin have been extremely well supported. Apart from the grants mentioned earlier, there are many other grants to organisations in the county, for example, £500,000 to the Ballymun Regeneration Project; £500,000 to the Finglas Youth Resource Consortium Project; £350,000 to the Donore Community Project; £150,000 to the Inchicore Sports Complex Steering Group; £300,000 to St. Agatha's Hall Development Association; and £200,000 to Tallaght Athletic Club.</P>
    <P>Overall, a total of £102 million approximately has been allocated under the Sports Capital Programme under the present Government and £96 million approximately has been allocated since the review, that is, since 1999. One must compare that figure of £96 million with the total of just £18 million allocated over a three year period from 1995 to 1997 by the previous rainbow coalition Government. Dublin has received approximately £27 million in sports capital grants in the three years 1999 to 2001, inclusive. In the three years under the previous Government, it received a total of just £4.26 million.</P>
    <P>It is not just through the sports capital programme, that Dublin, and specifically disadvantaged areas of Dublin, has received considerable funding. Under the young people's facilities and services fund, which is also operated by my Department, a total of £3.4 million has been allocated to date to fund 27 projects in the Dublin north-east task force area alone. A sum of £1.8 million was allocated initially with further fund<Col N="1155" /> ing of £75,000 and £1.5 million allocated in 2000 and 2001 respectively, to cover shortfalls that arose in respect of capital projects being developed in the area. Under the new task force plan, Dublin north-east has been allocated £687,500 in respect of 12 projects. All of these <Col N="1156" /> figures serve to illustrate that sport and projects in disadvantaged areas in general, in Dublin and all over this country, have never been better served than by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 22 June 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson Commission, military service allowance &ndash; MSA, &ndash; which had been introduced in 1979, was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990. The commission's report was published on 31 July 1990. This approach was consistent with settled public service pensions policy which provides that, when an allowance is being made pensionable for serving personnel, the benefit does not apply to existing pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have previously indicated to the House, <Col N="1158" /> the Commission on Public Service Pensions specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowances, including the military service allowance, and the consequences for pensioners generally in its final report which was published on 31 January 2001. The commission did not recommend any concession to pensioners in this context.</P>
    <P>The Government has not yet completed its detailed consideration of the commission's report. The report is a lengthy and complex document and contains many wide-ranging and far-reaching recommendations regarding public service pensions generally. These recommendations have implications for all parties having an interest in public service pensions, the Government, public service employers, trade unions, pensioner associations, individual public servants, as well as the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>For this reason, the Government is taking particular care in examining the report. When publishing the report, the Minister for Finance noted the commission's view that its recommendations as set out in its final report represent an integrated and cohesive long-term strategy for public service pensions, and that in implementing this strategy it would be important to preserve the integrity of the package of measures as a whole. I expect this element will be a significant consideration in deciding the Government's response to the commission's report.</P>

      <P>My intention is to have the plan finalised and implemented by end 2001, in accordance with the Government decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we put the new organisation <Col N="1159" /> in place and move ahead with the modernisation of the Defence Forces. It is equally important that the new organisation offers rewarding and challenging careers to Defence Forces personnel.</P>
    <P>The White Paper recognises the importance of the career dimension and provides for the preparation of an updated and very comprehensive Defence Forces integrated personnel management plan to address this and related issues. The chief of staff is currently drafting that plan and the process is well advanced. A key feature of the plan will be a continuation of the policy of regular recruitment which is now in place to achieve an improved age profile in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Arising from the special study on the Air Corps undertaken by PricewaterhouseCooper consultants, and reflecting the policy parameters laid down in the White Paper, Air Corps management has submitted a draft implementation plan to me and I have approved in principle the proposed new Air Corps organisation and this will be put in place following the completion of consultations with the representative associations which are at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the Air Corps, the Naval Service prepared a detailed implementation plan which I have approved. Implementation is proceeding, including the putting in place of the new organisation provided for in the plan.</P>
    <P>The White Paper provides that the overall strategy for the development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group which reported in 1999. I am pleased the various recommendations contained in the report have been broadly accepted as providing a general foundation on which the future development of the reserve can be built.</P>
    <P>Given the dependence of the reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. To facilitate this, I published the report of the steering group last year and launched a consultative process to seek the views of members of the reserve in advance of the drawing up of an implementation plan.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the new structural and organisational changes for the reserve will require about six years to bring to completion.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased last year to announce an unprecedented additional £250 million investment programme in new equipment and infrastructure. I have given the House the details of <Col N="1160" /> the programme which is being funded from payroll savings and from the sales of surplus property.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 47 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that upwards of £43 million has been allocated in my Department's Estimates this year for the provision of new buildings and the upgrading of existing facilities. The refurbishment of living quarters and the provision of recreational and community facilities for military personnel is an integral part of my Department's building plans.</P>
      <P>In this connection a special reinvestment programme was initiated by my Department in 1999, to complement expenditure on the normal range of building and engineering works, for the purpose of providing modern living, operational and training accommodation for the Defence Forces. The special programme is centred mainly on the Curragh Camp and on Collins Barracks, Cork. The cost of this programme is estimated at £45 million.</P>
      <P>In addition my Department has an ongoing construction programme over the next five years for the refurbishment of existing facilities for military personnel in barracks nationwide. The cost of this programme is estimated at more than £100 million.</P>
      <P>Details of projects in both programmes in so far as they refer to the provision of living quarters, recreational and community facilities are shown in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report. The expenditure proposed for these projects is £50 million approximately, £13 million for living quarters, and, £37 million for recreational and community facilities.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding the provision of night flying training for Air Corps pilots servicing the Garda air support unit; the discussions he has had with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 12 May 1999 during an operation in the ClareGalway region, the Garda Air Support Unit, GASU, helicopter which is piloted by Air Corps personnel inadvertently entered cloud. Contact was lost with the ground target, the mission was aborted and the helicopter proceeded to Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incident was the subject of an investigation carried out by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise. A report was subsequently published and this included a <Col N="1162" /> number of recommendations, one of which was that the Air Corps should suspend GASU night operations in rural areas with immediate effect until an effective programme of extra night flying is completed by Air Corps GASU pilots. This recommendation was implemented.</P>
    <P>To facilitate an effective programme of training which would not impinge on the ongoing GASU operation, I announced, in February 2000, that a Squirrel helicopter was to be acquired for the Air Corps as soon as possible for the purpose of pilot training in connection with the operation of the GASU.</P>
    <P>Work began in the Department on the preparation of the tender documentation and on 22 May 2000, a request for tender for the supply of one used Squirrel AS 355F2 helicopter to the Department of Defence issued.</P>
    <P>The AS 355F2 helicopter was manufactured by Eurocopter in France between 1988 and 1995. As the Department ideally required a helicopter which would be backed up by the manufacturer <Col N="1163" /> from the point of view of warranties, maintenance and support, the tender documentation issued only to Eurocopter through their Irish agent, Atron based in Sandyford, Dublin 18. Eurocopter was not able to offer a suitable AS 355F2 helicopter which they could guarantee and support.</P>
    <P>Discussions took place with the military authorities and the Air Corps and it was decided to attempt to acquire on the open market a used AS 355N helicopter, a later model of the F2 also manufactured by Eurocopter. The tender documentation was prepared and on 27 September 2000 a request for tender for the supply of one used AS 355N helicopter to the Department of Defence issued to a total of 15 companies. The closing date for receipt of tenders was 12 October 2000.</P>
    <P>The result of the tender competition indicated that there were very few AS 355N helicopters available on the open market. Six responses were received some of which offered different helicopter types which could not be considered. Essentially, the valid tenders from three companies related to the same, AS 355N helicopter which was available in the Philippines. Having considered the responses and the various factors involved, the option to look further into the possible purchase of this helicopter was not taken up by the Department.</P>
    <P>All options for the provision of night flying training of Air Corps pilots for the GASU are under active consideration in my Department but the prospect of obtaining a second-hand Squirrel helicopter for this work are not good given our experience in the tender competitions and the buoyancy of the market for such helicopters.</P>
    <P>This matter is the subject of ongoing discussion between my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>The tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps is progressing well. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of two medium lift helicopters, with an option of a third, for search and rescue purposes as well as an option for two medium lift helicopters for general purpose military transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tenders were invited on 5 March 2001 and the closing date was 19 April 2001. Four tenders were received. The four companies involved are Sikorsky from the USA, EH Industries Limited from <Col N="1164" /> England, Eurocopter from France and CHC Scotia from Scotland.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive evaluation process has begun on the proposed helicopters. The evaluation will, of necessity, take some time to complete. It is expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract later this year.</P>
    <P>The lead in times for the delivery of the helicopters differs and this is a matter that will have to be discussed with the successful tenderer. The question of the supply of a suitable helicopter for an interim period from the same company will also be the subject of negotiation in due course. I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to have the helicopters delivered at the earliest possible dates, while also taking account of the intensive training requirements involved.</P>

      <P> The first six armoured personnel carriers, APCs, were delivered on 11 June 2001. The balance of 34 will be delivered at a rate of four to five per month from July 2001 to January 2002.</P>
      <P>The armoured personnel carriers are being allotted to B Company, 3rd Infantry Battalion in the Defence Forces Training Centre in the Curragh Camp. The vehicles will initially remain with B Company to facilitate the development of APC doctrine and training.</P>
      <P>It is standard military practice to validate newly developed doctrine on training tactics and procedures for mechanised units prior to any deployment abroad. The responsibility for doctrinal matters in relation to the APCs rests with the director of infantry. The locations to be used for the validation of the training are at his discretion.</P>
      <P>The question of conventional mechanised training abroad with the new APCs is not being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 88 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of 31 May 2001 the establishment for bridge watchkeeping officers, below the rank of lieuten<Col N="1166" /> ant commander is 89. Bridge watchkeeping officers are officers with a naval watchkeeping certificate, NWC. The military authorities have advised that the current overall strength of bridge watchkeeping officers is 36. There are an additional nine naval watchkeeping cadets in training, and a further eight enlisted personnel due to complete their NWC training in September this year when they will be commissioned as officers in the Naval Service. A further such course for enlisted personnel is due to start immediately after the current course has finished. It is proposed to offer ten places on this course.</P>
    <P>The shortage of bridge watchkeeping officers is mainly due to the upturn in the economy which has greatly increased the range of opportunities available, not only to school-leavers, but most importantly the range of alternative employment opportunities in civilian life for young serving officers.</P>
    <P>At present, the number of early retirements of Naval Service lieutenants is higher than can be offset by annual cadet intakes alone. The expansion of the coastguard and openings in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has also had an adverse impact in this area. Of 28 officers who retired early, 15 entered the semi-State sector, where the excellent and unique training provided by the Naval Service continues to be put to good use in the service of the State. Fishery protection activity accounts for more than 90% of all Naval Service patrol time. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels may be deployed to other duties such as search and rescue, aid to the civil power, drug interdiction operations and assistance with pollution control. Since the establishment of the joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, the Naval Service has been involved in the following number of operations per year; 1996, one; 1997, three; 1998, 12; 1999, 11 and 2000, 16.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1167" /> As I indicated in my reply to Priority Questions Nos. 4 and 5, earlier today, on 3 April 2001, the Government approved the provision of a replacement contingent to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, comprising 559 personnel of the Permanent Defence Force for a six month period beginning 30 April 2001. This contingent will represent the final deployment of Defence Forces personnel to UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>On 23 May 2001, the UN informally inquired as to whether, in the context of withdrawal of the Irish contingent from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon &ndash; UNIFIL &ndash; in November of this year, Ireland would be willing to provide a guard and administration company of about 150 Defence Forces personnel for service with the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, UNMEE, with effect from December 2001. Following consultation with my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs informed the UN that, in the event of a formal request being received from the UN, the approval of the Government for the deployment of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNMEE for a period of 12 months from December 2001 would be sought. On 15 June 2001, the UN formally invited Ireland to contribute a guard and administration company of about 150 Defence Forces personnel to serve with UNMEE with effect from December 2001 for a minimum period of 12 months. Government approval will, accordingly, be sought at an early date for the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with UNMEE. Dáil approval for the despatch of the contingent will also be necessary.</P>
    <P>On 31 July 2000, the United Nations Security Council, under Resolution 1312, established the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, UNMEE, consisting of up to 100 military observers and the necessary civilian support staff in anticipation of a peacekeeping operation subject to future authorisation. Under resolution 1320 of 15 September 2000, the Security Council authorised the deployment within UNMEE of up to 4,300 troops until 15 March 2001. On that date the Security Council by its resolution 1344 extended UNMEE's mandate at the previously authorised levels of troops and military observers until 15 September 2001. The despatch of a contingent in December 2001 would, of course, be subject to the renewal of the mandate by the UN Security Council beyond 15 September 2001.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that a military team will undertake a fact-finding visit to Ethiopia and Eritrea at an early date when matters such as the precise role of the Defence Forces as well as the equipment required will be determined. A security assessment will also be carried out taking account of the situation on the ground at the time.</P>
    <P>In response to a separate request from the UN, I have agreed that two members of the Defence Forces will be deployed to the mission, with <Col N="1168" /> immediate effect, to take up staff appointments in UNMEE Force HQ.</P>
    <P>I have also agreed, at the UN's request, to the deployment of two officers of the Defence Forces as military liaison officers to the UN peace support operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, MONUC. These officers are expected to take up duty shortly.</P>

These areas are not considered entirely suitable by the military authorities for the full range of training they would wish to conduct with armoured personnel carriers. The military authorities are currently conducting a survey on possible new training areas which could be used for such training purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The overall strategy for the future development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group, which I established in January 1998. That group, which met each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations and met on three occasions with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, reported in September 1999. A thorough, comprehensive and indepth study of the reserve was undertaken, involving a considerable amount of work both by a military board established by the then chief of staff and latterly by the steering group itself.</P>
      <P>I formally launched the steering group report in November 2000 at a special briefing for the southern region in Thurles organised by the military authorities for serving members of the reserve. A similar briefing for the western region took place in Athlone in December 2000. A third briefing was held in Dublin in December 2000. I am pleased the various recommendations contained in the steering group report have been broadly accepted as providing a general foundation on which the development of the Reserve Defence Force can proceed in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a board, on which the FCA is represented, has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the steering group recommendations. I am further advised that, under the aegis of this board, struc<Col N="1170" /> tures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCA and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the reserve on voluntary service, I was anxious that there should be an ongoing process of consultation before proposals are finalised. I am further advised by the military authorities that it is anticipated that the board will submit its report to the chief of staff by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve force, as envisaged by the steering group, will be determined in the course of a detailed implementation process. That process will comprehend the drafting and development of a Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, which will be based on the steering group's report. The implementation of the structural and organisational changes will require about six years to bring to completion. The military authorities will consider and recommend detailed proposals for the restructuring of reserve units within each brigade area and in the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army reserve, organised into three reserve brigades.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the White Paper on Defence, an important change recommended by the study of the reserve is that members of the FCA should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions subject to appropriate qualifications, availability and advance training. Service by reservists on overseas peace support missions by other countries is quite common. General criteria governing selection for overseas service come within the scope of representation and any matters relating to overseas service by members of the reserve which come within the scope of representation will be raised with the representative associations at the appropriate forum. The question of the security of civilian employment for the members of the reserve who may wish to serve overseas will be considered as part of the implementation process.</P>
    <P>In order that senior Reserve Defence Force officers can serve and influence reserve activities at the highest level in brigade headquarters and the Defence Forces Training Centre, the steering group recommended the creation of four new lieutenant-colonel appointments. It is intended that these appointments will form part of the inte<Col N="1171" /> grated element of the reserve and personnel appointed to these appointments would hold them for the duration of their integrated service. While the mechanism for appointing personnel to these appointments has not yet been established it will form part of the implementation process.</P>
    <P>The steering group was particularly mindful of the need to preserve and retain the many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</P>
    <P>In advance of the completion of the plans for the implementation of the steering group recommendations the total sum allocated for the training of the FCA and An Slua Muirí has been increased by an additional £1.6 million from £5.7 million in 2000 to £7.3 million in 2001. This figure will provide for an increase in the number of man-days from the level of 84,000 in 2000 to 94,000 approximately in 2001. It is proposed to allocate approximately 75,000 days to annual training and approximately 18,000 to 14 day full-time courses of instruction for officer and NCO technical training.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>Following a tender competition which was conducted in strict compliance with Government procurement procedures, a contract was signed on 30 November 1999 for the supply by Mowag of Switzerland of 40 armoured personnel carriers &ndash; APCs &ndash; initial spares, special tools and training courses.</P>
      <P>The 40 vehicles, known as Piranha 8 x 8s, are being manufactured as 34 troop carrier variants, four command variants, one recovery variant and one ambulance variant. The total cost of the contract, which is spread over five years, is in the region of £40 million, including VAT.</P>
      <P>The first two vehicles were produced at the end of 2000 and following rigorous inspection and acceptance testing procedures were officially handed over to me on 11 January 2001. Both vehicles remained in Switzerland to facilitate training of Defence Forces personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full production run has commenced. Six <Col N="1172" /> vehicles, including the two vehicles handed over in January, arrived in Ireland last week and are now based in the Curragh Camp. The balance of the 34 APCs will be delivered at a rate of four-five from July 2001 to January 2002. All 40 APCs will have been delivered by January 2002 &ndash; almost two years ahead of previous expectations.</P>
    <P>The APCs are being allotted to B Company, 3rd Infantry Battalion in the Defence Forces Training Centre in the Curragh Camp. The vehicles will initially remain with B Company to facilitate the development of APC doctrine and training. I understand no decision has been taken on their final distribution within the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>The position is that, on the advice of the Government, the individual concerned was retired, by the President, with effect from a date in June 1969. The retirement was effected pursuant to section 47(2) of the Defence Act, 1954 and paragraph 18(1)(<i>f</i>) of Defence Force Regulations A.15, which provide that an officer may be retired &ldquo;in the interest of the service&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The individual initiated proceedings in the High Court in November 1998 on the circumstances of his retirement some 29 years earlier. The High Court found in favour of the State in June 1999. The individual appealed the case to the Supreme Court in September 1999. The Supreme Court found in favour of the State in January 2001.</P>
      <P>A decision to retire an officer &ldquo;in the interest of the service&rdquo; is taken only for the most compelling reasons. Given that the Government decision and advice to the President concerned military security, I am not in a position to comment in further detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The Helsinki European Council in December 1999 agreed on a voluntary target for establishing capabilities for Petersberg Tasks. This target, known as a Headline Goal, which member states aim to meet by 2003, involves the ability to deploy 50,000 to 60,000 personnel within 60 days and to sustain that deployment for one year.</P>
      <P>The development by the EU of this role is consistent with Ireland's tradition of involvement in UN peacekeeping missions. The centrality of the UN and the primary role of the UN Security Council in matters of peace and security is explicitly recognised by the EU. Ireland will participate only in missions authorised by the UN. Participation in an individual Petersberg mission remains a sovereign decision by the Government in every instance, on a case by case basis, and any decision to participate would require Dáil approval in accordance with existing legislation.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Defence sets out key elements of Government policy on overseas peace support operations. It recognises the important role that these operations play as an element of Ireland's foreign and security policy and as a demonstration of support for the United Nations and the conduct of international relations according to the UN Charter.</P>
      <P>The commitment to the EU &ldquo;Headline Goal&rdquo; in no way takes away from our commitment to UN peacekeeping. In fact, this contribution reinforces in a very conspicuous way our continued intention to support efforts to maximise international peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Moreover, what the EU is doing in identifying capabilities is in many respects similar to what has been happening at another level at the UN with the UN Standby Arrangements System. Ireland subscribes to the United Nations Standby Arrangements System, UNSAS, under which the State offers to provide up to 850 personnel for overseas peace support operations. This mirrors our commitment to the &ldquo;Headline Goal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At a time when the UN increasingly looks to regional organisations to undertake peace support operations on its behalf, it is very important to support such efforts at EU level.</P>
      <P>As participation will arise only where UN authorisation is in place the commitment to the EU &ldquo;Headline Goal&rdquo; does not impinge in a negative way on the overall thrust of the overseas peacekeeping effort. There is no contradiction between the EU and the UN, in fact, they are mutually reinforcing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participation in any individual mission will be considered by Government on a case by case basis. This will enable us to determine on each occasion how best to balance commitments to an EU-led operation, under UN authorisation, with our support for UN-led peace support operations from within our overall total commitment of up to 850 personnel to both UNSAS and the &ldquo;Head<Col N="1176" /> line Goal&rdquo; for peace support operations at any one time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take question Nos. 38 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>The establishment of medical officers at St. Bricín's Military Hospital is 15. There is currently a strength of three medical officers located at St. Bricín's Hospital comprising one commanding officer, one psychiatrist and one pathologist.</P>
      <P>The psychiatrist and pathologist, while available for general medical duties, are principally engaged in providing their specialist services. The brigade medical officer of Eastern Brigade, who is a fully qualified radiologist, provides radiology services at St. Bricín's Hospital. The medical officer commanding, Eleven Field Medical Company, FCA, also carries out medical officer duties in St. Bricín's Military Hospital. In addition, a medical officer is also on temporary duty at St. Bricín's Hospital from Southern Brigade, Cork.</P>
      <P>As noted, radiology, pathology and psychiatry services are staffed by appropriately qualified personnel. While a shortage exists of general medical officers in the medical corps it must be emphasised that in all circumstances when a military doctor is not available alternative arrangements are made with civilian doctors.</P>
      <P>A civilian consultant physician in respiratory medicine provides two sessions per week at the hospital. An ophthalmic clinic and an ENT clinic are conducted on the basis of one session per week each by specialist civilian practitioners.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for recruitment of military personnel including medical officers has been delegated to the military authorities who are actively endeavouring to maximise the impact of their recruitment efforts by advertising in relevant specialist publications including Northern Ireland medical publications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> A competition for medical officers was held earlier this year. Seven doctors were interviewed and found suitable for commissioning. To date, two have indicated that they will accept the offer of a commission. They are expected to join the medical corps in July and August respectively. The military authorities have advised that one of these two medical officers will be appointed to St. Bricín's Military Hospital. It is anticipated that one further successful applicant may also accept an offer of a commission.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House earlier today in reply to Priority Question No. 2, I am advised by the military authorities that they liaise as necessary with An Garda Síochána in relation to the application of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>The majority of military installations are enclosed by a perimeter fence or wall and members of the public are admitted only by permission.</P>
      <P>A public place as defined in section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, would appear not to include most military installations. The Curragh Camp, however, is not enclosed by any perimeter fence or wall and members of the public regularly enter the camp for social, domestic or business purposes.</P>
      <P>The primary responsibility for security within the Curragh Camp rests with the general officer commanding and the military police unit is tasked to ensure security. The military police have limited powers of arrest under section 268 of the Defence Act, 1954, as amended. These powers of arrest are exercised from time to time in relation to persons present in the Curragh Camp without authority, and such persons are then handed over to An Garda Síochána, to be dealt with by the civil courts.</P>
      <P>Following an incident in the Curragh Camp on 26 September 2000, during which a number of military police personnel were subjected to a serious assault, I am advised by the military authorities that additional security measures have been put in place to support the military police in the camp in the performance of their duties when required.</P>
      <P>The military authorities maintain constant liaison with the Garda in Newbridge and Kildare on incidents involving unruly or criminal elements in the Curragh Camp.</P>

It has been the experience that difficulties, when they <Col N="1179" /> occur, are usually of a temporary nature and are rectified immediately. In addition, the Defence Forces have put a liaison system in position whereby family members experiencing difficulties with communications can contact the parent unit liaison officer who will immediately attempt to address these problems or concerns.

      <P>My Department administers a grant-in-aid to the Irish Red Cross Society, which this year amounts to £609,000. The grant-in-aid mainly covers salaries of 14 permanent staff in the headquarters of the society and salary and related expenses for a staff member on full-time secondment to the Directorate for Asylum Seekers Services, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It also includes the State's annual contribution of £100,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva.</P>
      <P>I have received a copy of the strategic review of the Irish Red Cross Society. Officials in my Department are currently studying the review to enable them to respond to any legislative changes which may be required. As I have previously indicated, the Irish Red Cross Society is an autonomous body with full powers to manage and administer its affairs through its governing body, the central council. I do not get involved in the day to day running of its affairs. However, should the review require any legislative changes by my Department I will bring forward appropriate legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <P>Following the publication of the report of the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Public Enterprise into the accident at Tramore on 2 July 1999, urgent action was taken by my Department in relation to the implementation of the recommendations contained therein. In this regard I put in place arrangements to monitor progress in regard to the implementation of the recommendations. The sixth meeting of a working group charged with overseeing the process <Col N="1180" /> took place on 24 May 2001 in the Department of Defence, involving representatives from my Department, including the Defence Forces and the flight safety officer of the Air Corps, as well a representative from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources. Progress reports from the various bodies involved were presented and reviewed and a composite progress report was prepared in the Department and presented to me. In this regard, I am pleased to announce that considerable progress is being reported by all bodies involved in the implementation of the recommendations. This group are scheduled to meet again on 28 June 2001, and will continue to meet on a regular basis in order to ensure the speedy implementation of all the safety recommendations set out in the report.</P>
      <P>One of the key recommendations relates to the commissioning of an independent air operations safety audit of the Air Corps. I am pleased to report that intercontinental aviation safety consultants commenced their work on 21 March 2001 and concluded the audit on 29 March 2001. I expect to receive the report shortly. A further key recommendation contained in the air accident investigation unit report was the establishment of an air safety office in the Air Corps and this was acted on straight away. The air safety office has now been in operation for some months past and will be an intrinsic part of the new Air Corps organisational structure upon its formal implementation. A full-time flight safety officer of lieutenant colonel rank and an officer of captain rank have been appointed by the GOC Air Corps. The flight safety officer reports directly to the GOC Air Corps. A programme of specialist training and courses to equip the flight safety officer for his post has been under way since the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>As I have previously stated in the House, I take all safety issues very seriously and the safety of personnel working in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, at home and overseas, is of paramount importance. I have emphasised to the military authorities that safety standards in equipment, facilities and procedures are of the utmost importance. Funding is not an issue where safety is concerned. Funding is, and will continue to be, available to improve and modernise safety equipment and procedures where necessary.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 49 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>The representative associations PDFORRA and RACO signed and agreed to the terms of Partnership 2000 in November 1998, considerably later than other public service groups. Consequently, the process of setting up partnership arrangements in the Defence Forces did not commence as early as in other sectors of the public service. I believe that the partnership approach can be used to good effect in the management of the changes being under taken throughout the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Discussions are continuing with both representative associations in relation to the introduction of partnership structures in the Defence Forces. These discussions are at an advanced stage and it is my intention to set up a Defence Forces national partnership steering committee as soon as these discussions are completed. Following this, individual partnership committees will be set up at local level. I am sure the Deputies will agree it is important that due time and consideration should be given to this issue to ensure the arrangements arrived at are satisfactory to members of the Defence Forces while also addressing the organisational requirements of the Defence Forces.</P>

The Chief State Solicitor has advised that contracts of sale for the houses in question are, at present, in the process of being issued to the purchasers' solicitors.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Helsinki European Council in December 1999 agreed on a voluntary target for establishing capabilities for Petersberg Tasks. This target, known as a &ldquo;Headline Goal&rdquo;, which member states aim to meet by 2003, involves the ability to deploy 50,000 to 60,000 personnel within 60 days and to sustain that deployment for one year. Some confusion has arisen from the description of the capabilities for the EU headline goal as a Rapid Reaction Force. It is emphatically not a standing army. Rather, it constitutes a pool of capabilities available to provide the means to carry out the Petersberg Tasks, tasks of crisis management, peacekeeping and humanitarian activities, the national elements of which can only be deployed on foot of decisions by each potential contributor. Ireland's commitment of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces to the EU headline goal is on the basis that Ireland maintains the sovereign decision over whether, when and how to commit Irish personnel to a Petersberg Task operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the EU is doing in identifying capabilities is in many respects similar to what has been hap<Col N="1183" /> pening at another level at the UN with the UN Standby Arrangements System &ndash; UNSAS. At present Ireland subscribes to the UNSAS under which the State offers to provide up to 850 personnel for overseas peace support operations. This mirrors our commitment to the headline goal. At a time when the UN increasingly looks to regional organisations to undertake peace support operations on its behalf, it is very important to support such efforts at EU level. Consequent on the commitments made by member states at the capabilities conference in November last year a headline goal task force was established to collate and analyse the various commitments made in the context of a range of Petersberg Tasks type scenarios with a view to identifying any shortfalls in the required capabilities. A number of shortfalls have been identified and contributing nations have been requested to review their commitments in the light of these identified shortfalls. This work is currently ongoing. As part of the forthcoming Belgian EU Presidency it is proposed to hold a capabilities review conference in the autumn to seek to address any identified shortfalls in the headline goal capabilities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On 11 October last, I announced that I had <Col N="1184" /> decided that the time was right to proceed with the establishment of a legislative ombudsman for the Defence Forces. I added that, in establishing this office, it was important to ensure that a credible grievance system would be provided, one which would be fair to all members of the forces, while at the same time safeguarding the operational flexibility of the forces as a whole. At that time officials of my Department met with both of the Defence Forces representative associations, PDFORRA and RACO, to advise them of the position. It was indicated to them that the Department would, following a period of detailed consideration of the issues involved, bring forward proposals to give effect to my decision.</P>
    <P>Last year, PDFORRA, acting on its own initiative, submitted proposals to my Department which set out its views and concerns regarding the establishment and operation of a Defence Forces ombudsman. Following on from this, a number of informal meetings have taken place this year between officials of my Department and PDFORRA in order to clarify aspects of the association's proposals. PDFORRA's proposals and its concerns have received full consideration by my Department in formulating final proposals with relation to the establishment of the Ombudsman. The Representative Association of Commissioned Officers &ndash; RACO &ndash; has not made an equivalent formal submission. However, the Association has been brought up to date with the progress that has been made so far regarding the establishment of an ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position to make a formal proposal to the representative associations in the near future. Following this, I will make the necessary legislative arrangements in order to give effect to the ombudsman proposal.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58, 103 and 104 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not had any discussions on defence matters with my EU colleagues following the Treaty <Col N="1185" /> of Nice referendum. Ireland's approach to participation in PfP was set out in the presentation document of 1 December 1999, which was approved by this House. The document included the five priority areas of co-operation on international peacekeeping; humanitarian operations; search and rescue; co-operation in the protection of the environment and co-operation in marine matters. There is no institutional link between PfP and the European Union but PfP is relevant to the Petersberg Tasks. It will be recalled that participation in PfP is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentation, that is, a state selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation in PfP activities.</P>
    <P>Following on from joining PfP, an Individual Partnership Programme &ndash; IPP &ndash; for 2001 in respect of Ireland's participation has been agreed. This is Ireland's first IPP and therefore provides an initial presentation of Ireland's broad approach and planned activities. Ireland's policy approach will be developed in the light of initial experience and the IPP has been drawn up in a flexible form to allow for adjustment in the light of ongoing experience. Details of the planned activities, which allow for adjustment based on policy development and the availability of financial and other resources, have been placed in the Oireachtas Library. The activities chosen are, in the main, training courses, seminars and table top exercises and involve participation at officer and non-commissioned officer level.</P>
    <P>Ireland has recently commenced participation in the PfP planning and review process. Like other neutral EU states who participate in the PfP's planning and review process, Ireland will use this mechanism with a view to enhancing inter-operability with our PfP partners in such areas as planning, operational cohesion, logistics and language training. The aim of this process is to create the conditions in which different contingents can work together efficiently and effectively whilst undertaking peace support operations.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to undertake whatever activities with which they may be tasked from time to time. The White Paper on Defence sets out a comprehensive strategy for a reshaping and re-equipping of the Defence Forces to ensure that they are geared for the opportunities and challenges of the changing security and defence environment. In this regard participation in PfP does not involve the imposition of any changes in Defence Forces training procedures and equipment.</P>

      <P>In consultation with the Naval Service, it was agreed that the services of a professional shipbroker/agent would be engaged to assist the Department of Defence with the sale of LE<i> Deirdre</i>. The ship is 30 years old and having reached the end of its economic life was taken out of commission earlier this year. Expressions of interest were sought in the daily newspapers in April 2001. Mr. Dominic Daly from Cork was subsequently engaged to assist the Department in this regard.</P>
      <P>Arrangements were made by Mr. Daly to proceed with the sale of LE<i> Deirdre</i> by public auction on 14 June in the Carrigaline Court Hotel, Carrigaline, County Cork. Bidding for the vessel started at the ships scrap value of £50,000 and increased to a final bid of £190,000 from Seastream International Limited, Cornwall, England. The conditions of sale for the auction stated that the sale of LE<i> Deirdre</i> shall be subject to the approval of the Minister for Defence and I intend dealing with the matter as soon as possible. The ship was not sold off at a knock-down price. The accepted bid of £190,000 was above what was expected for a 30 year old ship and I am very satisfied with the end result of the public auction.</P>

      <P>The ministerial air transport service is currently operated by the Air Corps using the Gulfstream IV executive jet, acquired in 1991, as the principal aircraft backed up by the Beechcraft King Air turboprop aircraft. The Beechcraft provides only a limited MATS operation and it is also used for pilot training. Effectively it operates nationally, to the UK and, to a minor extent, to Europe. The aircraft resources required to provide a ministerial air transport service commensurate with current and projected requirements is under consideration. This is in the context of the increased level of business for Government Ministers and officials to Europe and further afield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The business of the European Union itself has grown by an unprecedented degree over the last decade both in the size of its market and in the depth and range of its activities. These changes have increased significantly the travel requirements of Government Ministers and officials. There is an ongoing requirement for the Govern<Col N="1187" /> ment to maintain a very active involvement both bilaterally, and through the EU and multilateral bodies like the United Nations, in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas so as to build Ireland's political and economic relations with countries from these regions. This requirement also involves substantial air travel by Ministers.</P>
    <P>The ministerial air transport service has been a major asset for successive Governments. The service has proved to be extremely flexible to meet the changing timetables of Ministers. It is important that any action required to maintain the high standards set for the operation of the ministerial air transport service is taken. In that regard, all options which could improve the service available to the Government are being examined by an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of Defence and comprising representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs and Finance. No decisions have been made as yet but I expect to bring a memorandum to Government on the matter.</P>

It is anticipated that by November new sentencing guidelines will have been introduced and that sentences imposed for &ldquo;aggravated felony&rdquo; offences then will be significantly less than they are now. The Consulate-General will continue to maintain contact with this person and to give her any assistance they can.</P>

      <P>Ireland is an active participant in the work of the International Energy Agency and is a member of the governing board. The IEA Bio-energy Implementing Agreement is an international collaborative agreement to improve international co-operation and information exchange between national research, development and demonstration programmes on bio-energy Its work area includes the technical improvement of biomass crop production technologies, development of systems and guidelines for environmentally sustainable and economic production of biomass for energy and other uses.</P>
      <P>Ireland is not a contracting party to the Bio-energy Implementing Agreement. However, the Irish Energy Centre as part of its new programme of energy research and development, is currently examining Ireland's future participation in a number of IEA energy related agreements, including the bio-energy agreement. I am confident that the Irish Energy Centre's examination will conclude shortly and a final decision on contracting to the Bio-energy Implementing Agreement will be made before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Mobile telephone masts receive transmissions from mobile phone users and transmit replies back to these users from the parties they contact. These communications are carried by radio signals at frequencies around 900MHz and 1800MHz. Research on the possible effects of radiofrequency exposure on health has been carried out for over 60 years and the results of many thousands of technical and medical studies have been published in scientific journals. Expert reviews of this work are published from time to time. For example, in 1997 the International <Col N="1192" /> Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection published a report entitled &ldquo;Non-Thermal Effects of Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields&rdquo; following an International Seminar on Biological Effects of Non Thermal Pulsed and Amplitude Modulated RF Electromagnetic Fields and Related Health Risks, at which the Department's chief technical adviser was rapporteur.</P>
      <P>The European Union, under its COST, co-operation on science and technology, programme has promoted and co-ordinated extensive research in this whole area. In May 2001 the final report on the biomedical effects of electromagnetic fields was published following completion of COST action 244 bis. The European Union has since approved a new COST action 281 which will deal with the health and biomedical effects of new communications technology. It is my intention that Ireland will participate in this action.</P>
      <P>Further, Ireland continues to support and participate in the World Health Organisation's EMF project. The WHO project co-ordinates research and standards activity on radiofrequency exposures across the world. It is expected to publish definitive reports on this research in 2003 and 2004.</P>
      <P>My Department is closely involved in much of this work and continues to monitor all relevant developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>Following the submission of the White Paper on Defence to Government on 29 February 2000 the Government conveyed approval for the allocation of 100% of pay savings arising from the reduction in the approved strength level of the Permanent Defence Force to 10,500, together with 100% of the revenue arising from the sale of property surplus to requirements, for investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence set out a very positive, developmental approach to defence in <Col N="1193" /> Ireland for the next ten years. It involves a new, unprecedented £250 million investment programme in equipment and infrastructure over that period. This programme will ensure that Ireland has a modern, sustainable defence organisation, second to none, with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.</P>
    <P>Substantial programmes of investment will take place in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service and some examples are as follows: the first six of the new fleet of 40 armoured personnel carriers for the Army, costing in total £40 million, were delivered to the Curragh Camp early last week. All 40 vehicles will be delivered by January of next year almost two years ahead of previous expectations.</P>
    <P>There has been significant investment on new vehicles for the Army with more than £6.5 million spent on specialist transport cargo vehicles, deployed to KFOR, and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4 x 4's, and ¾ ton trucks.</P>
    <P>More than £10.5 million has been expended on new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces in recent years. An investment package for the Army estimated at up to £25 million over the next three years is under way. The package includes the purchase of light infantry tactical vehicles, modern effective anti-armour weapons, night vision equipment, engineer equipment and medical field equipment. A pistol replacement programme for the Defence Forces has commenced.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the White Paper, I announced a major investment programme for the Air Corps with £55 million available over three years for the purchase of new aircraft. The tender competition for the provision of medium lift helicopters is well advanced and it is expected that the Department will be in a position to place a contract later this year.</P>
    <P>The build of the second new ship for the Naval Service which is similar to LE <i>Róisín</i> is almost complete. As with LE <i>Róisín</i>, the new ship will also cost over £20 million. The ship, which will be named LE <i>Niamh</i>, is expected to arrive in Haulbowline next month.</P>
    <P>The new equipment programme is a top priority for me. It ensures that the Defence Forces will develop as a world class military organisation in which people are proud to serve. The Army, Air Corps and Naval Service will have the most modern of equipment to carry out their roles at home and overseas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>In March 1979 the Government decided that the Air Corps should be provided with a jet engined aircraft to be, used as necessary, to transport the President, Ministers and officials in connection with official duties. A British Aerospace HS 125 aircraft was acquired and the ministerial air transport service commenced in July 1979.</P>
      <P>To allow the Government to fulfil European and other engagements during the term of Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 1990, the Government decided to lease a larger aircraft with transatlantic capabilities. Subsequently, the Government decided to acquire a Gulfstream IV and this aircraft, which can carry up to 14 passengers, entered service in March 1992.</P>
      <P>A Beech Super King Air 200 turboprop aircraft, which was purchased in 1980, is also made available in support of the service, mainly to a limited number of hub destinations in Europe. While Air Corps helicopters are not designated as part of the ministerial air transport service they are used from time to time for urgent transport missions. Air taxis are also hired on occasion.</P>
      <P>Aircraft usage during the period from 1 June 2000 to 31 May 2001 is as follows:</P>

      <P>The military authorities advise that Defence Force Regulations R5 and Training Instruction RTO/33/74 <Col N="1197" /> dated 26 February 1974 establish eligibility for promotion in the case of FCA officers, under the following headings: service in rank, ratings, annual training, recommendations by unit OC and relevant GOC.</P>
      <P>There is no reference to seniority in RTO/33/1974 as this is a guidance document outlining the basis eligibility criteria for promotion. However, seniority within a unit would be another factor considered in determining the order of promotion of officers who satisfy the basic eligibility criteria as outlined in RTO/33/1974.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the World Health Organisation has assessed the many reviews carried out in this area regarding possible adverse health effects from radio-frequency fields associated with mobile phone systems. The WHO has stated that none of these reviews have concluded that exposure to radio-frequency fields from mobile phones or their transmitter masts, sometimes referred to as &ldquo;base stations&rdquo;, causes any adverse health consequences. Exposure of persons to radiation from mobile phone masts is lower than exposure from a mobile phone handset.</P>
      <P>The WHO has also identified a need for further research to better assess possible health risks. In response to public concerns, the WHO established the International Electromagnetic Fields, EMF, Project to assess the scientific evidence of possible health effects of EMF. This project brings together current knowledge and available resources of key international and national agencies and scientific institutions in order to arrive at scientifically sound recommendations for health risk assessments. The project has established a formal mechanism for reviewing the research results and conducting risk assessments of exposure. It is also developing public information materials and bringing together standards groups world-wide in an attempt to harmonise international exposure standards.</P>
      <P>A large epidemiology study is being co-ordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer &ndash; IARC &ndash; which is a specialised research agency of the WHO. This study will try to identify if there are links between the use of mobile phones and head and neck cancers. The study is anticipated to be completed in 2003.</P>
      <P>The International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection &ndash; ICNIRP &ndash; has developed guidelines for radio-frequency exposure levels. These guidelines are based on a careful analysis of all scientific literature including thermal and non-thermal effects. The WHO recommend strict adherence to these guidelines and mobile phone companies licensed to operate here are required to comply with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123, 124 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>I should begin by pointing out that the initiative announced in the budget, and subsequently enacted in the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2001, providing automatic eligibility for medical cards to all persons aged 70 and over is wholly consistent with the overall approach taken by this Government to improve the position of the elderly. It was also the logical conclusion of the three year programme of doubling the medical card income limits for persons in that age category. Equally importantly, it should be emphasised that the introduction of this automatic medical card eligibility provision was not done at the expense of any other groups in Irish society. I want to make it clear that no person or group will find themselves disadvantaged from their current eligibility as result of this new measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget measure confers a new right to automatic eligibility for medical cards for persons aged 70 and older only. If a person in that age <Col N="1205" /> category has a spouse also in that age category then both individuals will have the same automatic eligibility right. If, however, the spouse or other dependants are below the age of 70, then the person aged 70 or more may continue to apply in the normal way, as at present, for a means tested medical card to cover him or her and a spouse or other dependants. The fact that the applicant is covered by the automatic eligibility provision would not affect the consideration of such an application to the detriment of the spouse or any dependants.</P>
    <P>The medical card limits applying in the above situation are not affected by the budget measure on automatic eligibility. Indeed, they have been enhanced since 1 March of this year by the final phase of the doubling of income limits.</P>
    <P>The negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on the implementation of the automatic provision are progressing and I am hopeful that agreement on outstanding issues will be reached in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Having regard to that consideration, I have not, as yet, made the commencement order provided for in the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am conscious of the fact that there is a need to promote greater awareness of the new automatic eligibility for benefiting persons. My Department and health boards have dealt with a number of inquiries and have kept callers fully informed of the situation. In addition, as part of a more pro-active campaign, I have raised with the Office of Health Gain the matter of a national information programme that will get under way when the remaining outstanding matters are resolved.</P>

      <Quest>the number of children who have had orthodontic work completed in each of the past five years in the Eastern Regional Health Authority or Eastern Health Board area; the percentage this number represents of the total number of children on the orthodontic waiting list in each of those years; the policy at Departmental level to assist the board in providing free public treatment; the policy at Departmental level to assist the board in providing semi-private treatment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; ERHA &ndash; has informed me that 1,436 children were discharged from the authority's orthodontic waiting list since June 2000. This figure is approximately 12.5% of the total number of patients on the orthodontic waiting list at the end of March 2001 quarter. <Col N="1206" /> However, the chief executive officer has also informed me that prior to year 2000 the information requested by the Deputy is not currently available.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the waiting times for orthodontic treatment are unacceptably long. At the invitation of my Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic services. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Following this review structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. These changes include the creation of the grade of specialist in orthodontics, the development of specialist training programmes and the creation of a grade of auxiliary dental worker to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
    <P>However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The ERHA has been allocated an additional £2.34 million this year for orthodontic services of which £1.61 million was for the orthodontic initiative. The chief executive officer of the ERHA has advised me of the following developments in the region in relation to its initiative to improve its orthodontic services: an additional consultant orthodontist has been appointed; the recruitment of another two consultant orthodontists is currently in train; two orthodontic specialists have been recruited and a further recruitment drive is in progress to recruit four more; the recruitment process for three managers to manage the orthodontic services in the three area health boards has been completed; two of the managers will commence duty in July 2001 and the third will take up duty in August 2001; and interviews for posts of dental surgery assistants in the East Coast Area Health Board have been completed and the recruitment process for the successful candidates is almost finalised.</P>
    <P>A competition in respect of similar posts in the other area health boards is being organised, a competition to fill the posts of dental hygienist in the area health boards will commence shortly, and the previously vacant post of superintendent radiographer at the regional orthodontic unit in St. James's Hospital unit has been filled. A similar post for the Loughlinstown unit has been filled on a locum basis, a six surgery facility at the Loughlinstown regional orthodontic unit has been developed and is currently being equipped, the equipping of an additional five surgery unit at the St. James's Hospital orthodontic unit is being completed, the Northern Area Health Board is currently progressing plans for the development of a new regional orthodontic unit to be located on the grounds of James Connolly Memorial <Col N="1207" /> Hospital, validation of existing waiting lists is currently in progress and agreement has been reached between the ERHA and the Dublin Dental Hospital on the training of specialists to work in orthodontics. Four dentists from the ERHA will commence training in 2001.</P>
    <P>The initiative in the ERHA will enable an additional 3,000 patients on the assessment waiting list to commence treatment.</P>
    <P>A proposal from the ERHA for a grant in aid scheme was approved by my Department. I am informed by the chief executive officer of the ERHA that the working group established in the Northern Area Health Board &ndash; NAHB &ndash; to report on the scheme's implementation are continuing to consider <i>inter alia</i>, the legal and operational implications of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 2000, passed by Dáil Éireann on 31 May 2001 has now completed its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas, having been passed by Seanad Éireann yesterday, 20 June 2001. It is intended that regulations to be introduced on foot of the <Col N="1208" /> Bill, covering open enrolment, lifetime cover, minimum benefit and risk equalisation, will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas for affirmation as soon as possible and I would hope to be in a position to do so during the autumn.</P>
      <P>The amended legislation will make further provision regarding risk equalisation, enable insurers to apply lifetime community rating and extend open enrolment entitlement to persons aged 65 and over. The proposed changes in relation to risk equalisation are aimed at facilitating further competition, while ensuring that the stability of the market is maintained and that community rating applies across the market. I am satisfied that they will have a fair and balanced impact on insurers and are in the best interests of the insured population.</P>

      <P>Legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department allows health boards to make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income. These payments are known as exceptional needs payments. There is no automatic entitlement to an ENP. Payment of ENPs are made at the discretion of the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding individual cases.</P>
      <P>The principle consideration in paying an ENP to address a particular need is that the need is of an exceptional nature. Payments should arise only under abnormal conditions and should not become a regular or standard practice.</P>
      <P>In general, assistance with fuel bills is carried out in accordance with an agreed code of practice drawn up between the health board community welfare staff, the ESB and Bord Gáis. If clearly identifiable exceptional circumstances exist an ENP may be made at the discretion of the health board.</P>
      <P>However, where a more long-term solution is required the applicant is required, in the first instance, to contact the utility supplier and set up a repayment agreement which takes account of the customer's income and general circumstances. The health boards will assist in setting up this type of repayment agreement.</P>
      <P>The South-Western Area Health Board, SWAHB, has been contacted on behalf of the person concerned and has advised that while the board has in the past assisted him with electricity expenses the community welfare officer, CWO, refused his latest application because he feels that the person concerned has not made sufficient efforts to pay his recent electricity bills.</P>
      <P>The SWAHB further advised that the person concerned has appealed the CWO's decision to the health board appeals officer.</P>

      <P>Access to the live register is available to both men and women who satisfy the conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance or who are entitled to sign for unemployment credited contributions.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of social welfare credits is to secure the PRSI entitlements of insured workers, who are temporarily outside the paid workforce for reasons such as unemployment, illness etc., in a manner which is consistent with the continued viability of the Social Insurance Fund. Where a person has no PRSI contributions paid or credited for more than two full contribution years, they are not allowed to claim credits until they return to work and pay PRSI contributions for at least 26 weeks. In view of the fact that the award of credits can give entitlement to a range of social insurance benefits, provided that a certain number of paid contributions have been made, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is necessary to have some limitations on such award.</P>
      <P>An additional requirement which applies to the award of unemployment credited contributions is that the recipient is available for work. The condition &ldquo;availability for work&rdquo; requires that the person should be available for full-time work.</P>
      <P>I might add that a separate arrangement exists to protect the long-term social insurance pensions of people, mainly women, who give up paid employment for periods of caring. From 6 April 1994, periods of time spent out of the workforce, including self employment caring either for children aged up to 12 years or incapacitated people are disregarded when calculating a person's pension entitlements. The maximum period which can be disregarded is 20 years. An examination of the homemaker's scheme is being undertaken as part of the review of eligibility conditions for old age contributory pensions and I expect to have a report later this year, which I will examine in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The person concerned made a claim for unemployment benefit on 5 June 2001. To qualify for payment of unemployment benefit a person must, in addition to satisfying certain contribution conditions, satisfy the deciding officer that they are available for and genuinely seeking work.

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases. In my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 310 which I answered for the Deputy on 29 May 2001 in relation to this particular case, I explained that the mortgage interest supplement had not been put in payment as the person concerned had not returned the application form to the local health centre.</P>
      <P>The South-Western Area Health Board has been contacted again on behalf of the person concerned and has advised that the house in respect of which the claim has now been made is jointly owned by the person concerned and her ex-husband and both names appear on the mortgage agreement.</P>
      <P>In order to finalise the application for mortgage interest supplement the community welfare officer, CWO, dealing with the case needs to know if the person concerned is repaying the mortgage herself or if her ex-husband is contributing to the costs involved as this will have a bearing on the amount of mortgage interest supplement payable. Confirmation of these details has been requested from the person concerned but remain outstanding. On receipt of the information requested, an assessment of the person's entitlement to the mortgage interest supplement will be made.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. There are currently 42,434 households in receipt of a rent supplement <Col N="1215" /> under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Total spending on rent supplements is expected to reach £134 million this year.</P>
      <P>Not all of these are in need of re-housing. In some cases, they have satisfactory accommodation that ordinarily they can afford but currently require income maintenance on a short-term basis only, for example, if they temporarily lose most of their income because of illness or short-term unemployment.  However, there are significant numbers of people in vulnerable categories who are relying on rent supplement and whose needs may best be met in a social housing environment.</P>
      <P>These include over 2,000 rent supplement recipients who are aged 65 years or more, over 4,000 who are receiving invalidity pension or disability allowance and others who rely on rent supplement on a long-term basis. A survey undertaken by the Department of the Environment and Local Government last year showed that the majority of new entrants to the SWA rent supplement scheme were in need of housing. Overall, the majority of recipients have been in receipt of rent supplement for more than one year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has decided in principle to introduce a new scheme of private sector rent assistance. The new scheme will be operated by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>One of the objectives of the new scheme will be to ensure that a full range of housing options is available to people with long-term housing needs, including those on local authority waiting lists who are renting in the private rented sector and who currently rely on SWA rent supplement. The new scheme will give the local authorities the extra option of private rented accommodation. In that regard, I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will be bringing detailed proposals to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>The protection of the architectural heritage is primarily a matter for the planning authorities. My role is to provide advice <Col N="1216" /> to planning authorities in the exercise of their functions. This is reinforced in the recently enacted Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Act, each planning authority shall, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area. This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage.</P>
      <P>Under section 4 of the Act, I may recommend to a planning authority that specific structures be included in its record of protected structures. A planning authority must have regard, under the Act, to any recommendation made by me. However, a decision may be made not to comply with a recommendation, provided that an explanation is made outlining the reasons why inclusion in the record of protected structures is considered inappropriate.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, last February I recommended to Sligo Borough Council that a total of 284 structures be placed on its record of protected structures. I am aware of the decisions taken by Sligo Borough Council on 11 June 2001. However, the Deputy will appreciate that, under the legislation, responsibility for the making of an addition to, or a deletion from, a record of protected structures rests with the elected representatives.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for the equality for women measures of the national development plan. The measures will fund a number of initiatives designed to promote equality for women, includ<Col N="1217" /> ing improving women's access to education, training and employment, the achievement of equality for women in the workplace and business and participation of greater numbers of women in decision-making.</P>
      <P>In October 2000, my Department invited proposals for project funding under the measure. More than 350 project proposals were received including three from the Sligo Leader Partnership. An element of one of the proposals related to the appointment of a qualified equality counsellor. A project appraisal committee chaired by my Department was established to consider the applications and to submit recommendations to me for funding based on the criteria agreed for the measure.</P>
      <P>Part of one of the proposals submitted by the Sligo Leader Partnership related to the production of an educational video and accompanying literature to visually highlight how women are excluded in certain sectors of society and to explore ways in which this exclusion can be tackled. A similar proposal was submitted by County Leitrim Partnership. The committee recommended that a co-ordinated project between both partnerships should be developed. The details of this co-ordinated project have yet to be agreed. The other two projects submitted by the Sligo Leader Partnership were not recommended for funding.</P>
      <P>On 14 June I announced grants amounting to £7.1 million which will support approximately 49 projects under the equality for women measure. Included in this funding is provision for the co-ordinated proposal between Sligo Leader Partnership and County Leitrim Partnership, which I approved on the basis of the recommendations submitted to me.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the need for anti-racism training in both public and private organisations. Within the past year there has been a number of initiatives on anti-racism training. In May 2000 the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism established a training unit which has provided anti-racism awareness raising training to over 40 Government and statutory organisations, national media organisations, the equality authorities, trade unions, employer and community organisations, and hospital and health boards. The training unit has developed a code of practice which sets out standards and approaches for anti-racism training following extensive consultation with practitioners.</P>
      <P>As part of its preparations for initiatives during the anti-racist workplace week next November, the Equality Authority has advertised for applications for a panel of anti-racism trainers. The anti-racist workplace week is being organised by the Equality Authority in partnership with ICTU, IBEC and the Construction Industry Federation with the aim of developing good anti-racist practice at workplace level. A key focus for the week will be training for the anti-racist workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last October the Government agreed to my proposals for a public awareness programme to <Col N="1218" /> address racism and promote an intercultural society. In February I announced the composition of the high level steering group to implement the programme in partnership with the equality division of my Department.</P>
    <P>The programme will be based on an outline framework developed by the NCCRI. The framework included plans to facilitate community groups and organisations in public awareness initiatives at local level. In May 2001 the steering group launched a grant scheme to assist community groups and non-government organisations working against racism. I have been informed that a request for a grant application form under the scheme was received from the Sligo Multi Culture Forum. The closing date for the receipt of completed grant applications is 16 July 2001.</P>

      <P>The Maternity Protection Act, 1994, has been amended by means of an order which was made on 8 February 2001. This amendment entitles a pregnant employee who commences maternity leave at any time on or after 8 March 2001 to maternity leave consisting of 18 consecutive weeks paid leave and eight consecutive weeks unpaid leave. A woman who commences additional unpaid maternity leave on or after 8 March 2001 is entitled to avail of eight weeks unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers commenced her maternity leave on 7 March. She would have needed to commence her maternity leave on or after 8 March 2001 to be entitled to the extension to the paid portion of maternity leave. As it is presumed that she did not commence unpaid maternity leave until on or after 8 March she is entitled to apply for eight weeks unpaid leave, instead of four weeks, if she so wishes.</P>
      <P>I wish to clarify the position regarding the commencement date for the increased entitlements. On 6 December the Minister for Finance announced that the increased entitlements would apply from early April 2001. Most increases provided by the annual social welfare Bill apply from April or even somewhat later.</P>
      <P>After the budget announcement, officials in my Department looked into the most appropriate method of applying the increased entitlements to maternity leave and the possibility of applying the maternity leave increases not only to women who commenced maternity leave from early April but also to women who went on leave prior to that date. These issues were examined in conjunction with officials from the Departments of Finance and Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Attorney General's office. It was decided that the only practical method of implementing the increased entitlement to leave was to base it on the date of commencement of leave.</P>
      <P>It is essential that an order made under the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, complies with that Act. The Attorney General advised me that it would not be possible to have the order extend the increased period of maternity leave to those persons who could not comply with the notice requirements, that is to employer by employee, of the parent Act and that any attempt to make the order retrospective could be deemed to adversely affect the rights of employers and would be open to challenge. The increases in maternity leave are not merely a matter of the State paying out extra weeks of maternity benefit. They have major impact on employers in many ways, for example the need to replace employees for a longer period than expected and in some cases contractual obligations in respect of payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> The effective dates of the increases, as set out in the order, take account of the notice requirements under the Act.</P>
    <P>My aim was to implement the increases in maternity leave as far in advance of 2 April 2001 as possible while still complying with the parent Act. The position is that the need to comply with the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, limited the extent to which the increases could be applied to persons who commenced maternity leave before 8 March 2001.</P>

      <P>The European Council Resolution of 17 January 1995 (OJ C329, 4.11.96) on the lawful interception of telecommunications sets out the general operational needs of law enforcement agencies relating to the lawful interception of telecommunications. The resolution is effectively a set of guidelines for manufacturers and providers in the development of new telecommunications equipment. While the terminology used in the 1995 resolution was intended to be technology neutral, advances in the telecommunications area since it was drawn up pointed to the need to clarify and explain its text. One of the papers produced in developing these clarifications-explanations was ENFOPOL 98. The process has moved on since this paper was prepared and a new draft resolution clarifying the 1995 resolution is currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>Neither the existing resolution nor the proposals under consideration relate to the rules applicable to the interception powers of law enforcement agencies; rather they relate to the operational requirements of those agencies. The lawful interception of telecommunications messages continues to be governed by national legislation which, in this country, is the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 to 153, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that where caravans and vans are parked illegally on the public highway appropriate action, including prosecution is taken by the Garda. Such prosecutions are taken for alleged breaches of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961, as amended.</P>
      <P>Where caravans and vans are parked illegally on private or public owned lands it is a civil matter and, for the most part, falls to be addressed by means of civil remedy. The question of compensation is then a matter for the courts.</P>
      <P>I should state that there are circumstances where trespass may also be dealt with under the criminal law. It is an offence under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, for any person to trespass on any such place in such manner as causes or is likely to cause fear in another person. The Garda Síochána has the power to direct a person to desist from acting in such a manner and-or to leave immediately the vicinity of the place concerned in a peaceable or orderly manner. It is an offence for any person to fail to comply with such a direction from the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971, makes it an offence for a person to forcibly enter land, to remain in forcible occupation or to encourage or advocate the commission of an offence of forcible entry or occupation. Where offences under the criminal law are detected, including relevant road traffic provisions, appropriate action, including prosecution, is taken by the Garda Síochána. I am informed by the Garda authorities that there have been no prosecutions for breaches of sections 2 and 3 of the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act, 1971, in respect of the years 1995 to 1999, inclusive. Statistics for 2000 have not yet been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> While the investigation of alleged breaches of the criminal law associated with trespassing is a matter for the Garda, any representations received by me in this regard are forwarded to the Garda authorities for their attention. From time to time I have received representations in relation to amending the law in this area. While I have no proposals in this respect at present, my Department will continue to keep the matter under ongoing review.</P>

In line with a PPF commitment to mainstream certain essential services provided under CE, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding this issue. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as CE schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department.</P>
      <P>The transfer of such moneys to my Department will result in significant improvements in assistance towards ancillary services for schools. The discussions are at an advanced stage and I hope to make a further announcement regarding this matter in the near future.</P>
      <P>While my Department does not operate a scheme for the provision of classroom assistants to schools generally, schools will have the flexibility to use the funds for ancillary services. My Department already has a scheme in place for providing schools with special needs assistants where schools require assistance in meeting the needs of pupils with various disabilities. Schools can apply to the special education section of my Department where they consider they are in need of such assistance.</P>

      <P>Individual school management authorities are responsible for implementing effective policies to counter bullying in schools. In 1993 my Department issued the document entitled Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour to all primary and post-primary schools. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. A further circular in 1994 reminded school authorities of their responsibility in formulating a written code of behaviour and discipline which should include specific measures to counter bullying behaviour.</P>
      <P>The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department, and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools and sets out models of best practice in this area. A copy of the report has been made available to all schools.</P>
      <P>Where staff within my Department receive telephone calls, regarding instances of bullying, advice and assistance are offered by staff to the callers. My Department will examine specific complaints regarding alleged instances of bullying behaviour, but only after every effort has been made at school level to resolve the matter. In addition, the national educational psychological service is available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties.</P>

      <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the body with national responsibility for health and safety matters in the workplace. Under the health and safety legislation, school managerial authorities in their role as employers are responsible for providing a safe environment for all personnel present in the school. This duty requires the drawing up of a safety statement for the school. The statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils. The safety statement should be reviewed on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>In 1996 the Health and Safety Authority issued a report of the advisory committee on occupational safety and health at first and second level schools. The committee included representatives of the partners in education, my Department and other interests. The report contains a recommended format for a safety statement for schools. Copies of the report are available from the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

      <P>Enrolment in second level schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of individual schools. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area. This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The post-primary administration section of my Department at Portlaoise Road, Tullamore, County Offaly, gives assistance to parents when <Col N="1231" /> children are refused admission to, or excluded from, recognised post-primary schools. These cases come to my Department's attention either through a telephone call or letter from worried parents.</P>
    <P>My Department endeavours, through a process of consultation with the schools and through the inspectorate, to secure a suitable school placement. It must be stressed again that, at postprimary level, my Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil.</P>
    <P>In more difficult situations, the national educational psychological service is available to assess pupils in order to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner. This may involve the provision of additional support to the school. In such cases the inspector liaises with the school concerned when the appropriate resources have been sanctioned.</P>

      <P>Third level institutions offer a diverse range of scholarships funded from a variety of sources, including from their own resources and from private donations. My Department does not hold details in relation to each such scholarship.</P>
      <P>Under the programme for research in third level institutions, which is co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund, third level institutions compete for funding for institutional research programmes. These programmes include the awarding by the colleges of postgraduate scholarships. A total of 290 post-graduate researchers had been assigned under the programme by 31 January 2001. As many as 49 post-graduate scholarships were awarded in 2000 under the postgraduate research and development skills development initiative in the technological sector.</P>
      <P>Government of Ireland research scholarships are awarded by the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences. More than 200 postgraduate scholarships have been awarded by the council since its establishment in 1998, including 93 awards for the academic year 2000-01.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I announced the establishment of the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering <Col N="1232" /> and Technology. The new research council will put in place, within these fields of study, similar post-graduate scholarship arrangements to those applying in the humanities and social science areas.</P>
    <P>My Department operates three third level maintenance grant schemes and these are administered by the local authorities and the vocational education committees. Copies of the schemes are available from my Department and the relevant awarding bodies, local authorities or vocational education committees. A summary of the criteria for determining eligibility under the schemes is currently available on the Department's website: www.irlgov.ie/educ. My Department expects to issue the 2001 grants schemes shortly, with details of revised rates of maintenance grants and revised income limits.</P>
    <P>Seven Easter week commemoration scholarships are awarded annually by my Department to the students who obtain the highest results in particular groups of subjects in the leaving certificate examination. My Department also offers 50 third level scholarships annually under three Irish scholarship schemes. Copies of the scholarship schemes are available from my Department. Details of the scholarships are also currently available on the Department's website.</P>
    <P>The third level student support schemes do not extend to post-graduate study outside Ireland. However, the Finance Act, 2001, provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for tax relief in respect of postgraduate fees paid for part-time and full-time courses pursued in private and publicly funded colleges in Ireland and abroad.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of tuition fees in the UK, EU students, including Irish students, are eligible for grant assistance towards the tuition fees, subject to the same conditions as apply to students who have been resident in Northern Ireland and Britain. This means that students from lower income families will receive full grant assistance towards the cost of their tuition fees.</P>

      <P>I have received a copy of the findings of a survey carried out by the National Adult Literacy Agency on the conditions of adult literacy scheme premises. The national adult literacy service is delivered locally by vocational education committees with funding provided by my Department. The acquisition of premises for adult literacy is a matter for the vocational education committees, as the providers. The annual grant <Col N="1233" /> for literacy from my Department may not be used to build or purchase premises, although it may be used for rental costs and for minimal repair works. Funds for the literacy service have increased from a base of £0.85 million in 1997 to £10.67 million in 2001.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Adult Education, entitled Learning for Life, recommends the provision of limited capital funding for the further education sector for building where no other options are available, for essential health and safety and disability access requirements and ICT equipment and networking. This issue will be examined in the light of resources available in the context of the Estimates process. It will continue to be an objective to ensure that the existing education infrastructure is used to optimum effect to address adult literacy and further education needs.</P>
