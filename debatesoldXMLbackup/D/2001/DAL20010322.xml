      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with two different topics. I propose to deal with these two topics separately and I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. In regard to the first topic, I received notice from Deputy Penrose and I call on him to state the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention &ndash; the need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to make a full statement on the latest information available to him about the suspected case of foot and mouth found in a sheep at Jenkinstown, County Louth; the steps being taken to determine the source of any possible outbreak; when it is expected that the results will be available from the laboratory at Pirbright and what other action the Government intends to take as a result of this incident. In view of the importance of the matter, I hope the Ceann Comhairle will agree to this request.</P>

        <b>:</b> I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of crucial public importance &ndash; the proposal by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to crush an important plank of local democracy by taking from the elected members of local authorities and giving to city and county managers the power to make waste management plans, including building <Col N="302" /> incinerators, to compensate for the abject failure of this Government to introduce a policy of reduction of waste at source and major reuse and recycling programmes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, I would like to make a short announcement before the Order of Business. In the last half an hour, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has received the overnight tests from Pirbright. I would like to inform the House that the results of two of the samples taken from a flock in County Louth have proved positive for foot and mouth disease. This is a major disappointment given the intensity of the efforts by all sectors of society to keep the disease out of Ireland. It is a secondary outbreak in the same exclusion zone just south of the Border in Jenkinstown. The new outer exclusion zone was set up last evening. A number of other issues directly arise.</P>
      <P>Subject to the agreement and co-operation of the Opposition, I would like if the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development could make a full statement to the House as soon as possible &ndash; perhaps at 11 a.m. or 11.15 a.m. &ndash; and, if it was possible, and with the agreement of the House, if Opposition spokespersons directly involved in agriculture, food and rural development could also make a statement with some questions and answers. I would ask that the Minister could be released from the House as soon as possible thereafter. We have to prepare our case immediately for the veterinary committee which will meet in the morning on just how this is handled on a national level. We also have to look at issues in relation to sheep on the Cooley Mountains and at the other farms in the area. Of course, other matters arise. The professional group will also meet in the next number of hours to issue its deliberations on how we handle this at a national level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very disappointing but I ask the House for its co-operation on the matter. It is not on the Order of Business but perhaps with co-operation, it would be better if the Minister and Opposition spokespersons made statements here as quickly <Col N="303" /> as possible so that the public would be aware of how we intend to handle these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we get agreement on the Taoiseach's suggestion for statements at 11 a.m.?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole House will be very disappointed and will share the Government's disappointment at this grave news. I assure the Taoiseach and the Government of the full co-operation of this side of the House in addressing this serious issue. I suggest that the House adjourn for a few minutes for the Whips to agree on urgent statements and to release the Minister as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obviously a huge shock to all of us to hear this news despite the enormous national endeavour that unified the country in a way that we have not seen in a while. The Labour Party will co-operate fully with the Government in whatever measures it now sees fit to further protect a vital national infrastructure and interest. I agree with the suggestion that we adjourn briefly. I would be happy, if the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development needs to attend urgent business, for the Minister of State at the Department to take statements in the short term. We will no doubt return to this issue next week. However, there might be urgent business for the Minister to get on with immediately and he should not be prevented by the House from doing whatever is necessary to protect something that is important to every citizen of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Similar to other parties, this matter is of the utmost urgency and gravity from the Green Party's point of view. We hope the matter can be given absolute priority and we will co-operate in every way in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose the suspension of the House until 11 a.m.. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has been involved in the discussions with me throughout the night and morning on this issue. If the Whips could meet immediately, perhaps we could begin that debate. The Minister would like to take the debate and to be released quickly from the House. It is best that the House deals with the issue before the Minister is released.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business shall be as follows: statements re foot and mouth disease in County Louth; No. 19<i>a,</i> motion re membership of committees; No. 46, Carer's Leave Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (Resumed); No. 6, Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; No. 47, state<Col N="304" /> ments on Iraq, to be taken not later than immediately following the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21; and the order shall not resume thereafter.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 19<i>a</i> shall be decided without debate; that proceedings on the Statements on the Outbreak of foot and mouth Disease in County Louth shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion within one hour and shall be confined to the following Members and the following arrangements shall apply: the statement of the Minister, the Minister of State and the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael and Labour parties shall not exceed ten minutes in each case, the statement by the main spokesperson for the Green Party shall not exceed five minutes and Members may share time. Following statements the Minister shall take questions for a period not exceeding 25 minutes.</P>
      <P>The proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 46, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. and the proceedings on No. 47 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: the opening statement of the Minister, the Minister of State and the main spokesperson of the Fine Gael and Labour parties shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes. Members may share time. The provisions of Standing Order 26.3 regarding leaders' questions on the Order of Business shall not apply.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies Mitchell, Howlin and Sargent for their co-operation with these arrangements for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. As a matter of clarification, I said earlier that the outbreak was in Jenkinstown and I thank the farmer in question and his sons for their co-operation. He lives in Jenkinstown but he has three holdings and the holding from which the sample has proved positive is in Proleek, which is well within the exclusion zone but much closer to Maigh than Jenkinstown. I wanted to clear that up.</P>

      <P>The whole House will want the Government's undivided attention to be given to this national crisis. I ask the Taoiseach if he will agree to meet Opposition party leaders later in the day to discuss how best we can assist in <Col N="305" /> mobilising all the resources of the State to fight this great threat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unusual Order of Business and the Labour Party wants to co-operate with the Government 100% on what is the nation's singular objective, to contain the outbreak of foot and mouth that has been confirmed. In terms of keeping the Opposition informed, I reiterate Deputy Mitchell's request. Will the Taoiseach be available later today to do so? If not, will the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or one of his Ministers of State arrange a mechanism for us to be informed? It is most important to keep the public fully informed. We have learned that it is important for the fullest, clearest and most unambiguous information to be available to people. This common endeavour, which is important to us all, must be carried out in a transparent way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other party leaders, we in the Green Party, in smaller parties and Independents also need to be part of this common approach, not just in the House but in both parts of this island, as we now have a great deal in common. We need to ensure nobody is excluded from the information loop. The request made to the Taoiseach should ensure the Green Party is able to speak with the other parties. Everybody in the House, without exception, should be kept informed of how best to co-operate and make sure this problem is dealt with effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be glad to make those arrangements. I am not sure about when the meeting of the expert group will conclude. The best advice will emanate from that group and from the senior veterinary personnel. We will arrange an appropriate time during the afternoon where we can do that, as soon as we have assembled the information. I will arrange that.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business (Resumed). - Foot and Mouth Disease: Statements.</Title>
    <P>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh): During an inspection of a flock at Proleek, near Jenkinstown, County Louth, in the late evening of 20 March suspect lesions were observed in a number of sheep by my Department's veterinary inspectors. A further detailed inspection was carried out by a virologist, samples were taken, the farm was restricted and the flock was slaughtered.</P>
    <P>The results of the samples, which were forwarded yesterday to the world reference laboratory for foot and mouth disease in Pirbright, UK, have come to hand this morning. Unfortunately, they have indicated that two samples were positive. Accordingly, foot and mouth disease is confirmed in this flock.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the flock is located at Proleek, within the surveillance zone established arising from the outbreak at Meigh, County Armagh, on 1 March. Yesterday, controls were inten<Col N="306" /> sified in this region and animal movements in County Louth were stopped on a precautionary basis. I also established an extended protection zone and I have now served an order extending the existing surveillance zone and protection zone around this farm. The European Commission and the relevant veterinary authorities have been informed in the last half hour.</P>
    <P>As an initial step, I have decided that the ban on exports from Ireland of susceptible live animals will be retained and that exports of animal products will be temporarily suspended. The matter will be discussed in the standing veterinary committee of the European Union tomorrow. The committee is meeting on a regular basis in view of outbreaks in different member states. We will seek to ensure that the EU restrictions will be imposed on a regional basis, as was the case in relation to France. Until the standing veterinary committee meets tomorrow and discusses the outbreak in this country, I cannot say what the outcome will be.</P>
    <P>This outbreak is a major disappointment given the intensity of effort by all sections of society and by all parties and Members of this House. I wish to express my appreciation for that over the past three and a half weeks and particularly today. The flock in question had been examined on a number of occasions because it was in the surveillance zone. It was examined as late as last Friday and last Tuesday. On all previous occasions it was found to be without symptoms. It is clear from the experience emerging from the UK that this disease is difficult to detect, particularly in sheep. Consequently, it is my intention to proceed with an aggressive strategic slaughter of flocks in the region.</P>
    <P>The fact that this case is within the existing surveillance area where the most stringent controls have been in place, that there had been intensive examination of the animals in the area over the past few weeks and that movement of animals has been prohibited in the area allows for a realistic hope that this can be managed and dealt with within that area. We also have the advantage that a disease control centre has been in place since 1 March at Ballymacscanlon, which is only half a mile from the farm where the outbreak occurred.</P>
    <P>This is a major disappointment for all concerned, for the country at large, for the agri-business and agri-tourism sectors and for farmers in the region. It is a big disappointment also for those involved in the front line who have worked so hard in the fight against the disease. There has been remarkable national solidarity on this issue. We need that solidarity now more than ever. We will proceed to deal with the outbreak and its consequences. I appreciate the indulgence of the House in allowing me to leave to meet with the experts and promptly to put in place a number of vital operational measures.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to believe that we cannot confine the situation to the outbreak in this region. It is in the Cooley peninsula which is a self-contained region. The farm in question is in the exist<Col N="307" /> ing surveillance zone and is only a couple of miles from Meigh. We are regarding the outbreak as a secondary outbreak within the existing surveillance zone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a major blow, nationally, to farmers in the Cooley area and to the Minister and the various officers and officials who have worked so hard to try to prevent this. We will give every support possible to assist in confining this disease and to preventing its spread. It will be critical support. We will give unquestioning support to measures that will help but where we see deficiencies we will expose them. Where we can suggest improvements, we will make them.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out, without the slightest ambiguity, that the interchange of experiences and insights in the House over the past couple of weeks has been helpful. I hope it will continue to be so in the future and I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing to keep the lines open. The last thing the Taoiseach and the Minister need at this stage is more meetings but it would be essential, in the interests of all, to have the minimum structure necessary to keep information flowing and to maintain an exchange of views so that whatever can be offered in terms of practical support will be offered.</P>
      <P>The initial priority must be to contain this outbreak. It is disappointing to discover that it is a secondary outbreak within an existing exclusion zone. We need to know, as quickly as possible, how it has spread that far. We must find the reason and eradicate it. It is even more important that the new and extended exclusion zone which the Minister has set up is made as watertight and impenetrable as possible. That will require substantial assistance from the community around the zone and from others.</P>
      <P>It will also place a further burden of difficulty on the people who live in the zone and in contiguous areas. We should mark our concern for the position of people who are living, farming and working within that zone. If anything needs to be done to support them in the difficulties they will face, not just difficulties of physical movement but difficulties in earning their living, those measures should be put in place. It should be a part of this operation to ensure, as far as possible, that the effects on the people in the immediate area are minimised and that their needs are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is located in the Cooley peninsula. That peninsula, a beautiful place, poses a number of particular difficulties for disease control. There are a number of flocks on the peninsula and they will have to be gathered together and maintained under strict control and supervision. Can the Minister say if there are any other susceptible animals in the Cooley peninsula? My information, for example, is that there are herds of deer on the peninsula. They are susceptible animals and are capable of spreading the disease. We must implement whatever measures are required to prevent further spread by that vector. <Col N="308" /> Has the Minister plans for contiguous vaccination in the areas surrounding the extended exclusion zone and have arrangements been made to ensure corresponding action in Northern Ireland? This vaccine does not respect borders and if we are to make an effective exclusion zone it must be exclusive over all the zone and that would include action in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>If anything was needed to underline the message that we cannot relax our vigilance this confirmation of disease is probably the worst way. All the measures in place throughout the country must be reconfirmed and strengthened. The controls on movement of livestock must be scrupulously observed and rigidly implemented. The provisions taken for disinfection must be beefed up because we cannot afford to take chances. There can be no question now of relaxation of restrictions in advice given to the population to prevent the spread of this disease. We need assurance that the UK authorities are taking all the measures possible to prevent spread of the disease. The main source of this disease is still on the other side of the Irish sea. We continue to be at risk as long as new outbreaks continue in Great Britain and not just from the infection there already but from other vectors. We must insist the UK authorities apply more stringent controls at points of exit from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and, if necessary, at points of entry into Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for sending me a copy of The Foot and Mouth Disease Contingency Plan for Ireland, dated April 2000. It was referred to in the House last week. This document appears to have been prepared by someone who just looked at what the legislation provides. Unfortunately it is not an operational plan for what happens in the event of an outbreak. It is simply a bureaucratic recapitulation of what various Acts and regulations apply. It needs to be updated seriously but this is not the time to do it. &ldquo;Ní hé lá na gaoithe lá na scolb&rdquo;. We need to look at it again when we emerge from this dreadful tunnel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a day we hoped would never arrive but we were apprehensive that a case would be confirmed at some stage. I, and my colleagues in the Labour Party, are deeply disappointed at the announcement of a positive result from the laboratory test at Pirbright in relation to the two sheep originating from the flock at Proleek, County Louth, which as the Minister indicated is within the exclusion zone. Despite the tremendous, unified, national and co-operative effort which involved farmers, workers, hauliers, hoteliers and others and extended across all sectors of urban and rural society, we have not succeeded in keeping out this disease. It is important, however, that we salute the efforts of the officials <Col N="309" /> of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Garda, members of the Defence Forces, all organisations involved and the general public.</P>
      <P>Coming from an area where agriculture and tourism are important, I resisted efforts made by people to have regulations relaxed. We in the Labour Party support the Minister on the measures taken and we assure him that we will support him and the Government in the national effort required to contain this outbreak. This is not an occasion for anything other than a concerted unified effort and this must be espoused in the Chamber. The public would expect nothing less. It is not a day for drawing conclusions either. The two most important issues are the need to identify the source of the infection and the need to put in place containment measures to prevent spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine had representatives of Bord Bia in yesterday and they discussed the importance of being outbreak free in this jurisdiction. We all know the importance of the agri-food industry to the Irish economy. It represents about 10% of GDP with an output of almost £11 billion. The magnitude of the task facing us should not be under-estimated. We are highly export orientated with about 90% of our beef, 80% of our dairy products and about two thirds of our sheep meat and 60% of our pig meat production being exported. Meat and dairy products constitute the largest component of our exports, accounting for about 55% of the total. We now have to identify how we can maintain that. The Minister has indicated his efforts at the standing veterinary council and at EU level to regionalise the situation. That we did not have a confirmed case in the Republic meant prices for our livestock had increased significantly within the past few weeks, particularly for sheep and pigs. Cattle prices went up about 7% helped mainly by the demand of the UK market. Sheep increased by 25% and pig prices increased by about 15%. That illustrates the importance of our efforts to date and the tremendous sense of national disappointment across the country this morning.</P>
      <P>We will be positive and constructively critical in support of the Minister and the Government at this time. It is critical that we act and ensure we take effective measures. Our neighbours in Great Britain had a major problem and we have not been inspired by how they dealt with it. The more pictures we saw on television and in the papers the more inevitable it seemed that it would reach us here. I have many relations in England and I encouraged them not to travel to Ireland despite pressing engagements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I am disappointed we have had an outbreak of foot and mouth when we had hoped it could have been avoided. I, too, acknowledge the tremendous efforts made by so many people to prevent the spread of the disease and I recognise the work <Col N="310" /> of the Minister and his departmental officials. It seemed our efforts were being successful and it is a great pity to hear of this outbreak. I also commend the efforts of the Garda, the Defence Forces, voluntary and community organisation and individuals, many of whom were seriously inconvenienced. We must reiterate with even greater fervour the importance of sustaining our efforts.</P>
      <P>This crisis has had a huge impact on the farming community but has also impacted on many other organisations and industries, particularly the tourism, food and catering industries, sporting organisations and others. We must take account at a later stage of the long-term impact of the crisis.</P>
      <P>It is important now that the best and most effective containment measures are put in place to ensure the disease does not travel beyond the single outbreak. Perhaps the Minister would outline the contingency plans that have been made to deal with the disposal of the infected and slaughtered animals. These are very important in terms of containing the disease. Early alert systems are also vitally important in order to prevent further outbreaks.</P>
      <P>The time has come for us to ask our neighbours in the UK to take account of the impact of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease on Ireland. We do not yet know whether the outbreak occurred as a result of direct infection from the Meigh outbreak or whether the disease was airborne. The epidemic proportions of the disease in the UK and continuing activities in regard to elections and tourism give rise to serious questions to which we should seek answers.</P>
      <P>The disease is highly infectious and easily airborne. If outbreaks continue in the UK, we will find it difficult to contain the disease here. We are dependent on factors completely outside our control, such as wind direction, to limit the spread of the disease. We must examine the containment procedures in place in the UK. We must also renew our appeals to people to observe disinfection programmes and to be vigilant in regard to the movement of animals and people between Ireland and the UK. We must ensure every effort which can be made is made. Unfortunately, we are constantly catching up with this disease because the incubation period is such that one does not become aware of the disease until visible symptoms appear. The Labour Party will do all in its power to support the Minister's efforts to ensure the outbreak is contained.</P>

      <P>There is a danger now that people will panic and we must avoid that. We must keep cool heads and adopt a concerted approach to this issue. We must also ensure we have a common purpose with our neighbours in Northern Ireland, given that we share so much in common, including a solitary outbreak. We must galvanise our efforts on an island-wide basis.</P>
      <P>We must focus our vigilance on the extended exclusion zone and at points of entry to the State. That should be our foremost concern. We must stamp out the disease quickly. I am informed by people in the tourism industry that some £200 million has been lost to date and, as of yesterday, a further £300 million was written off. This outbreak will cause further losses. The farming community is part of a wider community of victims as this problem affects many sectors.</P>
      <P>We must adopt a measured approach to this outbreak because nothing will be gained either within the country or outside of it by making matters appear worse than they are. Has the Army been put on standby? Is it intended to revise the policy of closing small abattoirs in the long term? Is it intended to reappraise agriculture in the context of this outbreak? </P>

        <b>:</b> People throughout the country will be greatly distressed by the revelation that the foot and mouth virus has penetrated County Louth. The scenes of anguish we witnessed among farm families in the UK as they saw entire herds destroyed and burned &ndash; which, in some cases, they had spent a lifetime nourishing &ndash; left a deep impression on the Irish people who feel a sense of solidarity with their plight. I fervently hope the virus will be contained. I hope the situation in Louth is not that which pertained in Britain where the disease was probably incubating for months prior to discovery.</P>
      <P>This airborne virus is spread on the wind which makes it a real wild card. If it were to spread here, I am not convinced that the scorched earth policy of killing and burning every animal in sight should continue to apply without a major debate. If the massive intensification of factory farming and the indiscriminate transport of animals which accelerate the spread of the disease continues, the successful elimination of the disease at this point could be followed by a further outbreak in a year or two. It is simply not sustainable to destroy a herd every time. While our efforts should concentrate on containment and isolation, a debate should open up here and Europe on alternative means of coping with this disease, including the possibility of an inoculation programme.</P>

      <P>I assure the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development of my continued support and that of my party for <Col N="312" /> the Department's efforts to contain the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Today's news that the disease has been confirmed in County Louth is extremely worrying and deeply disappointing for all who have worked tirelessly to combat the spread of the disease and for members of the community at large who have co-operated in such a united and determined way with the precautionary measures put in place. Those efforts and that co-operation must now be redoubled and we all have a responsibility to play our part.</P>
      <P>Our sympathy goes out to the families in County Louth most immediately affected by these confirmed cases. The Minister emphasised that this is a secondary outbreak within an existing exclusion zone and we would wish it to remain so. Increased vigilance and full co-operation can hopefully contain this outbreak. The immediate question in the minds of many is what effect this will have on the individual schedules of ordinary people and the wider community. Perhaps the Minister would outline the Department's recommendations in the light of this outbreak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Minister's thoughts at this stage about the measures which will be taken in regard to susceptible livestock in the Cooley peninsula? What are his thoughts on measures in regard to the movement of people in that area? This is an issue of major concern to an area which has significant and deservedly famous tourism infrastructure. Will the Minister indicate the controls which will be put in place to enforce the exclusion zone which, clearly, will be larger than the previous one and include a seashore element? On this occasion will greater use be made of Customs officers' local knowledge which is a valuable resource and should be used to the maximum? These officers are disappointed that more use has not been made of their advice, expertise and local knowledge up to now. It is important that we should know what provisions are intended for susceptible animals in the Cooley Peninsula generally. In my original statement I asked the Minister to update the House on whether there are any herds of deer on the Cooley Peninsula and the measures which will be taken in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the spokespersons for continuing to adopt a constructive approach to this matter, particularly now that there is a confirmed case. I will put lines of communication in place and arrange a briefing session later this afternoon. The expert group established about two weeks ago under the chairmanship of Professor Michael Monaghan of the faculty of veterinary medicine in UCD is meeting today. Its job is to advise the Government on any adaptation or refinement of the controls in place, especially for the movement of people and sports <Col N="313" /> events. The group was due to meet at 11 a.m. and following its deliberations information will be made available this afternoon.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes raised a number of matters. He asked if any other flocks were under surveillance on the Cooley Peninsula. The answer is no. I hope this is an isolated single case, but there are no other herds or flocks of sheep under surveillance. There is intensive enumeration of flocks in the area. The district control office at Ballymascanlon has database information on all the various flocks of susceptible animals. While I do not have precise details about deer numbers on the Cooley Peninsula, I am aware that the Department will be able to supply that information later this afternoon.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes specifically asked if the Department had any plans to vaccinate animals in contiguous areas. The clear advice I have received from the veterinary experts is that vaccination would not be the preferred policy for the following reasons: vaccination creates immunisation for a particular strain of the virus. The current strain is type &ldquo;O&rdquo;. There are seven other strains against which vaccination would be inactive. The dose would have to be repeated every six months to ensure cover. Our white country status for international trade in over 60 countries would also be affected. We have no plans, therefore, for the introduction of vaccination.</P>
      <P>I am in daily contact with the Minister for Agriculture in Northern Ireland, Mrs. Bríd Rodgers, and will inform her of the situation this morning. The chief veterinary officer, Mr. Colm Gaynor, has already spoken this morning to Mr. Bob McCracken, the chief veterinary officer in Northern Ireland. Part of the exclusion zone will extend into Northern Ireland. It is ironic that the authorities in Northern Ireland were planning to relax some of the movement controls in place today, but I assume that because of the outbreak these plans will now be put on hold.</P>
      <P>I am in constant contact with the Minister for Agriculture in Great Britain, Mr. Nick Brown, and have asked that they ensure that the disease which continues to be rampant there does not spread to other member states. There are disinfectant facilities at access points to other countries, but the facts are that the disease has spread from Great Britain to France, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland and now, regrettably, the Border region of County Louth.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton said that the virus can be spread by airborne methods, birds and rodents. It is extremely difficult to manage. I beg the indulgence of the House in order that I may go to the national control centre for the disease in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development where operational measures to ensure a direct response will be put in place. I cannot yet say what those operational measures will be, but there will be an aggressive approach to susceptible animals within the Cooley Mountains control zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Penrose asked for an indication of the <Col N="314" /> containment measures. I must wait until after the meeting I am arranging before I can answer. I appreciate the compliments paid by Members to the gardaí and Army personnel. There is a strategy meeting every morning at which the Garda, the Army and various other Departments are represented. I am aware that representatives of the Revenue Commissioners also attend the meetings. I will inquire about the use of the local knowledge of Customs officers as Deputy Dukes asked.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton raised an important point about plans for the disposal of animal carcases. It is a critical issue because members of the public are disconcerted by the images on television of burning pyres. In the case of Jenkinstown, the sheep in question are suspect and we are waiting the outcome of tests. In the case of animals infected with foot and mouth disease, the intention is to have the bodies burnt and buried in landfill sites. Rendering plants will not take them because personnel at those plants do not wish to work with infected animals. Many of the workers concerned are part-time farmers and aware of the risk to their farms. There will be an aggressive policy of eliminating susceptible animals in a region before infection, the animals will then be taken in sealed trucks to rendering plants and disposed of. The Army, the Garda and the Civil Defence have been alerted to staff outer checkpoints and seal off the area as tightly as possible.</P>
    <P>That is as much information I can give until I meet the experts and agree the operational measures. I will brief party leaders and spokespersons later this afternoon.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other speakers in expressing deep disappointment with the confirmation of the outbreak at Proleek, not Jenkinstown. It is important we get the geography of this case right. It is a secondary case from Meigh. The townland of Proleek is four or five miles away as the crow flies while the home farm of the individual farmer is in Jenkinstown. Another farm is at Riverstown. It is a great disappointment and the implications for the concentrated sheep farmers in the Cooley peninsula are obvious. In addition, the tourism industry, which is a significant part of the local economy, is already suffering greatly and that will have to be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes raised the issue of wild deer. There are also wild goats in the Cooley Mountains and those are two factors which will need to be examined. The dangers and hazards of animals roaming around are obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the significant number of commonages, getting agreement on shareholding so that farmers in the Cooley peninsula can receive payment has been difficult. I appeal to the Minister <Col N="315" /> and his officials to put a team together to examine the delay in this area to see if payments can be expedited. I am sure I speak for other public representatives in the constituency when I say we will be only too glad to support and facilitate with our local knowledge.</P>
    <P>It is worth bearing in mind that the Cooley peninsula is bound on one side by the sea and by the Border on the other. Given that a new exclusion zone will have to be set north of the Border because of the location of this outbreak, the level and degree of co-operation with those north of the Border will be vital. The area involved covers south Armagh, south Down and north Louth where there is a significant concentration of sheep.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider not only setting up administrative structures in his Department but asking the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation to do likewise so it can interface with the tourism industry in the Cooley area because of the severe difficulties which apply there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I live a mile and a half from this outbreak. While I realise it is a national tragedy, it is a double tragedy for Dundalk and the many small businesses affected. Losses are mounting, gridlock is everywhere and will now intensify. Will the Minister consider conducting a quick economic study of business in the area? Will he put pressure on banks and the Revenue Commissioners to take a compassionate view of this national tragedy? It is a disaster for Dundalk, the largest town in Ireland. People cannot get to work. I know the Minister is conscious of the position and has been in Dundalk a number of times recently. Will he give complete priority to seeing what can be done in terms of a compensation package for people caught in the exclusion area? I pay tribute to the work of the district veterinary officers from Ballymascanlon. That they have kept this disease out for so long is a tribute to their ability. If this dreaded disease had to appear anywhere in the State, it was inevitable that, following the outbreak in Meigh, it would appear in County Louth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my constituency colleagues and other Members who have expressed their disappointment. For those of us who represent County Louth, we are more closely associated with it and know the position there better. The efforts of the Minister and his Department are far ahead of those of the British and that is the opinion of people in the Border area. Obviously, now that the disease has come to our doorstep, those efforts must be intensified. I agree with my colleague that it will be devastating not only to the farming community but also to tourism. Carlingford and Omeath are areas of high tourism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider, in conjunction with the Minister for Defence, involving the Civil Defence on a full-time basis? It has been involved, but not on a full-time basis. There have been occasions when it was recruited on a full-time basis to assist in work. Will the Minister undertake to publicise the extended exclusion area? How does he propose to do that? Obviously it will include local newspapers in counties Louth and Monaghan. It is also important that, if members of the public must enter the exclusion zone, they know in advance the travelling restrictions that are in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks about those trying to keep out the disease. What area will be closed off as a result of this case? What area of country does the Minister intend to recommend to the EU as an exclusion zone? Has he reached agreement with his Cabinet colleagues on support for farmers and others in these regions? This is an emergency and, the longer it continues, the more difficult it will be for farm families and others directly involved. There is another problem outside the exclusion zone. Many farmers who wanted to trade cattle with neighbours will now be badly hit by the controls. While we accept this is necessary, it is important that some means are found to allow those families to continue to make a living and that any moneys due to them through farm assist, or social welfare for those outside farming, are paid with the least possible red tape.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any indication of the vector involved in the spread of the disease? If we are talking of containment measures, we must have an idea what vector was involved in the spread of the disease in this case. Was an emergency plan developed over the past six weeks, is it in place and is it being implemented? A number of reports have suggested that people can move easily through the exclusion zone. Will the Minister guarantee to the House that such practices will not continue now that there is an outbreak in north Louth?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister and his colleagues make arrangements for the containment of deer? Deputy Dukes touched on that issue. It is a sensitive one and the county IFA has been in touch with me because its members are deeply concerned about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> Another problem in upland areas is irresponsible people from cities who have acted extraordinarily in recent weeks. Major efforts have been made by local rangers and the uplands council to exclude people from recreational use of the areas. Will the Minister and his colleagues consider a bar on movement through the upland areas except for local access and farming traffic? I support the call made by Deputy Kirk for liaison with tourism interests. This outbreak will have a devastating effect in parts of County Wicklow, particularly upland areas, where tourism is a major issue. Unless there is serious liaison, severe damage will be done. I compliment the Minister, the Ministers of State and their staff on the excellent job done to date.</P>

      <P>Indeed. I appreciate the tribute paid to the people of Ballymascanlon. They have been doing an outstanding job since 1 March. Deputy Bell asked about the Civil Defence which has already been involved. I will ask for its involvement to be intensified. The exclusion zone map will be published, as the Deputy asked. To do this we will avail of the facilities of RTE to which I pay tribute on the marvellous job it has done. Its teletext service is updated daily. The exclusion zone map will also be published on our own website. The value of utilising the local media has been highlighted by Deputy Penrose. That will also be done. Deputy Crawford asked about the location of the exclusion zone. It will extend from the mouth of the Fane river, south of Dundalk, to Hackballscross and across the <Col N="319" /> Border bringing it into line with the existing exclusion zone.</P>
      <P>Deputy Naughten asked about the contingency plan, a copy of which I have forwarded to Deputy Dukes. It is accompanied by a large operational manual. It has been put in place as if there was an outbreak from the start. It outlines the legal directives and so forth.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roche asked about wildlife in County Wicklow and the position on hill-walkers. Like many other activities, hill-walking is and will continue to remain banned. We will, unfortunately, have to start all over again with preventive measures being intensified to which the response of the public has been marvellous in respect of which sports organisations have played a big part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed the matter of compensation payments in the House last night. A number of Members, including Deputy Penrose, raised the important matter of regionalisation. Like the Taoiseach, I have been in contact with Brussels this morning about this extremely important aspect of our policy. We are looking to have the County Louth exclusion zone regionalised for which there is a precedent in France where an outbreak of food and mouth disease was recently confirmed within the boundaries of two administrative departments. If we succeed in having the County Louth exclusion zone regionalised, it would ease the problem considerably for the economy as a whole. It would mean, however, that my colleagues in Government, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs, would have to embark on a diplomatic initiative. Even before the confirmation of a case of foot and mouth disease on our territory, some third countries were causing difficulties for us. Assuming we make progress on regionalisation, we will then have to convince EU and third countries to accept our products from the remainder of the country.</P>
      <P>I will ensure there is a comprehensive briefing session later this afternoon for party leaders and spokespersons. I express my appreciation of the solidarity of the House. I hope this will continue, that there will be a unified, coherent response to the problem and that we will succeed in confining the disease to the Cooley Peninsula. I extend my sympathy to the people of the area who have already endured almost four weeks of disruption and sacrifice. This will continue to be the case for some time. This is a national emergency. It will be well worth the effort, in the national interest, if we succeed in containing the disease in the Cooley Peninsula.</P>

      <P>While I recognise the need for the Bill, I am not sure that it can adequately cater for the needs of 120,000 family carers. After the budget, Mr. Eddie Collins-Hughes, the director of the Carers' Association, criticised the package and said it was incredible that only 5,000 extra people of the 120,000 family carers in desperate circumstances would receive any form of carer's allowance. The number of such carers indicates the huge problem that exists in the community and the services that are needed in terms of providing an adequate response.</P>
      <P>The Carer's Leave Bill is a response in so far as it recognises the efforts and endeavours of people for which they received no recognition from any Government agency in the past. The Government and the statutory agencies now have an opportunity to recognise such carers in terms of the 65 weeks leave without pay that is available to people to care for family members, spouses, etc. However, although carer's benefit and carer's allowance are available, many of the people who will apply for carer's leave from work will not be eligible for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some categories will be penalised because people on superannuation have been specifically excluded from the terms of the Bill. They will not receive the same credits as other workers for the time taken out. This means they will have a break in service with regard to their pension rights. If a person in the public service takes carer's leave, his or her superannuation contributions may not be made because he or she is on leave without pay. The Minister should examine this situation and ensure that people who decide to look after their loved ones are not penalised. Particular attention should be paid to this aspect because credits will be given to all other workers. However, those on superannuation will not bene<Col N="321" /> fit although they are contributing to their long-term security.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to officially address the needs of many young carers, but they should be recognised. Such carers are often under the age of 18 years and some of them are as young as ten years of age. Despite their tender years, they make a huge contribution in a caring capacity. They may perform small tasks, but they mean much to the people for whom they are caring. The tragedy is that often the young people's efforts in providing such care are misunderstood in other areas. Such carers may be absent from school because of the time they devote to caring. Their school records or performance may not be up to standard, but they do not highlight the fact that they are carers to their teachers or others in their schools. As a result, such pupils may be considered as showing a lack of commitment to their education, etc.</P>
    <P>If the work of such young people is brought to the attention of the statutory bodies, their efforts should be recognised and supported. There should be some facility for liaison in this area. It only involves a small number of young people, but their efforts are important. Their work is delicate and they need delicate attention rather than a strong arm response in terms of being told that they should not be caring for others, etc. The people in need of care may want it from somebody close to them rather than strangers.</P>
    <P>When a person returns to work after taking carer's leave, he or she is not guaranteed the position he or she vacated. It can be difficult for employers, but a person returning to his or her workplace may find another person in their position. This can cause tension in the workplace. Following a person's work as a carer and the trauma he or she may have experienced, it would be regrettable if the pressure on him or her was continued in the workplace when he or she returns. The Bill states that the job of a person taking carer's leave may be filled by a temporary worker, but efforts should be made to ensure that the person has the right to return to the position he or she held before taking the leave.</P>
    <P>A spouse or family member often has to care for a person on a 24 hour basis. For example, a person could be totally immobilised or paralysed following a severe accident. The Bill states that the person is allowed one carer, but this measure should be relaxed if he or she needs 24 hour attention. The usual arrangement would be care in 12 hour shifts and the Bill should make provision for a second carer in such circumstances. Facilities are not available for such people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We are lucky to have a facility like the rehabilitation centre in Dún Laoghaire. In my constituency three young adults require 24 hour family care following accidents. While the families have received help and assistance from the health boards the Minister must relax the guidelines where cases have been brought to his attention. I welcome the Bill. It is an advance in some ways <Col N="322" /> but I ask the Minister to address the issues I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Government for introducing it. However, it is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the needs of carers. The State's role in supporting carers has been very grudging. This is illustrated by the tiny proportion of full-time carers in receipt of financial support from the State. Some estimates suggest that up to 200,000 people are involved in caring, for example, the recent study in the Western Health Board area pointed to the many thousands involved in caring. If this was to be applied to the rest of the country it is clear that the numbers getting support from the State are tiny.</P>
      <P>On the radio this morning parents talked about looking after autistic children and the demands they can place on a family, including the full-time, 24 hour care that is often necessary. One parent described how the services available to him in England 30 years ago were extensive compared with what is now emerging here. We all bear responsibility for not developing enough services to those who need full-time care, be they children or adults. One of the great tasks of this millennium will be to work out the level of State support to be given to those who care for others in their home. It is an enormous challenge, one we are only beginning to address. There is a need to speed up the assessment of how it is to be done.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I spoke to a staff member in a health board who told me that a nursing home is charging £600 per week to care for an elderly person. When the costs of residential versus community care are considered huge discrepancies emerge. We expect people to do an awful lot in terms of caring for people at home with very little supports. Those Deputies who have met the representatives of the Carers Association Limited will be aware of the effort they make with very little support. They have great difficulty in accessing aids, be they physical or practical, such as home extensions. They also appear to face a bureaucratic nightmare in accessing the help that would make a difference. There is also a need to look at rates of pay to home helps and nurses in communities to ensure that people have the kind of help that will enable them to stay at home full time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a welcome addition, not only in terms of the carer's benefit but the rights of employees to take leave from work for varying reasons generally connected with family commitments. I ask the Minister to consider the submission made to his Department by the free legal advice centres. It contains six to eight recommendations which are worth considering. Each one is reasonable and if they were accepted they would add greatly to the value of the Bill. A key point they make &ndash; we discussed this when debating the Equal Status Bill &ndash; is that some aspects of the legislation are too rigid. I agree with that. Given the varied nature of caring and the unex<Col N="323" /> pected demands that can be placed on families due to illness &ndash; often there is no warning and things happen very quickly &ndash; there is a need to build greater flexibility into the provisions of the legislation, although I accept that could be abused.</P>
    <P>There is scope to look at the provision regarding 12 months continuous service. Given the huge job changes and varying career patterns in today's world, people may be excluded by this provision. There should be flexibility here to ensure that the person to be cared for will not miss out.</P>
    <P>The free legal aid centres also recommend that the amount of work and earning limits should be increased to a more realistic level to offset the loss of income for carers. This should be considered, especially in view of the contrast in costs between residential and community care.</P>
    <P>With regard to the limitation on the number of carers, the Bill provides that only one carer can take leave from work in respect of the same person to be cared for. That is ridiculous and needs to be changed. Often care is a 24 hour task and more than one person may be required to enable someone to stay at home.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that an employer can, without reason, refuse leave for a period of less than 13 weeks. What is the reason for this? It should be re-examined on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On the question of leave accrual, the free legal advice centres point out in their recommendations that if a woman can accrue a holiday entitlement during the course of maternity leave surely a person should be able to accrue entitlement during carer's leave. They suggest a right to a portion of annual leave should be available during carer's leave. A formula should be worked out, based on the length of carer's leave in comparison to maternity leave.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider for Committee Stage the recommendations set out in the submission by the free legal advice centres. He also should consider inserting a section to ensure that the legislation is more responsive to the nature of caring, including its unpredictability and the lack of notice people often get. This would greatly improve the Bill. While I welcome it, the Bill is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of providing support for carers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to welcome family friendly legislation on a day of horrific news regarding the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. There has been much talk of the need to ensure that legislation enacted is family friendly and this Bill meets that in allowing people to take temporary leave from their employment for up to 15 months or 65 weeks to look after persons in need of full-time care and attention. It is very welcome and overdue. Plays and novels have been written about people who gave up their livelihoods, including the expectation of marriage, to look after elderly or ill parents without any pension entitlements or payment from the <Col N="324" /> State. Many of these people would have given up good jobs. This long overdue measure is very welcome.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the number of people currently in employment has risen substantially, which is welcome. However, more than 250,000 people are in part-time employment, many of whom are women. There is a need to ensure people in this type of employment can avail of breaks for various reasons. Very often parents, particularly mothers, need to take time off to care for sick children.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State does not pretend the legislation is a panacea for what is required to ensure it is more geared towards families. This is one aspect of two pieces of legislation, including a further announcement in the budget. Prior to the introduction of the Protection of Employees Part-Time Work Bill, which is welcome legislation, part-time workers had little or no entitlements. The budget announcement to extend maternity leave has been well received. Unfortunately, those who missed the closing date will be lobbying every Member of the House to ensure they can now avail of it. This is an indication that mothers in particular want to take extra time off to be at home with their new babies. This legislation forms part of these three announcements.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that people could live to the age of 120 and questioned whether that would be good. I would not wish to hang around that long. I might end up in shady pines long before that, as my children threaten regularly. We have an ageing population. In my constituency of Dublin South Central, including Ballyfermot, Drimnagh and Crumlin, there are large pockets of people who moved to these areas when the housing estates were built in the 1940s and 1950s. One can see the ageing population in these areas. In the urban context, there may be some chance of family support because sons or daughters do not live too far from their parents. In rural areas it is much more difficult to provide this support. Unfortunately, in some urban settings there is not the type of support that one would expect.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the carer's benefit scheme is an attempt to foster support for those who need it. This begs the question why does it not exist anyway. Very often, financial constraints mean people cannot give relatives the kind of support needed. I am not suggesting the payment of £96.50 from April to someone caring an elderly relative who may need care and attention is a huge amount of money. Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the cost to the State if that elderly person had to receive full-time hospital care. The payment acknowledges that the State recognises the contribution these people make and the effect on the person being cared for. I know of many elderly people who have been considered for placement in nursing homes but who are adamant they want to remain in the family home with the support of their family. We must make it as easy as possible for family members to support dependant relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> Under the carer's benefit scheme, the deciding officer or appeals officer at the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will decide, on the basis of a medical assessment carried out by that Department and information provided by the person's GP, whether the relevant person is in need of full-time care and attention. I plead with the Minister and the Minister of State to re-examine the criteria for receipt of carer's allowance. If the carer's benefit is to be determined in the same rigid manner as the carer's allowance, a large number of people will find they are not eligible for the payment. Given that the legislation seeks to encourage people to do what should come naturally, that is, stay at home and support relatives who need help, we should not create obstacles and barriers which prohibit eligibility for carer's allowance. In some instances, if one cannot prove the dependant person is totally bedridden and almost near to death's door, one has no chance of qualifying for a carer's allowance. Given that the carer's benefit is an insurance based scheme, if one has the relevant contributions the case may be looked at more sympathetically. I urge the Minister of State to ensure the criteria for eligibility is not an obstacle to those who wish to avail of this benefit.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification on the statement that for second or subsequent claims, the employee will be simply required to have been in paid employment for the previous 13 weeks or have been in receipt of carer's benefit in that period. Does that mean one can go on to a subsequent claim if one has been in receipt of benefit? Deputy Fitzgerald queried the sense of having to be in employment for a 13 week period. Can one go on to a subsequent claim after the 65 week period if one has been in receipt of carer's benefit during the 13 week period prior to the claim?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the commitment of people in communities. We are lucky that it has always been the practice that people voluntarily give of their time to support their communities. People take part in meals on wheels in local authority housing estates. People also do lunches in community centres every week on a voluntary basis. I spoke yesterday to a man who is very involved in a pitch and put club in his area. He spends part of every week doing voluntary work in the hospice. We are very lucky this type of work is taking place. I have been involved with members of the Alzheimer's Society. Husbands and wives have had to give up work because it was not possible to leave their partner at home alone. There have been impediments to the work being done by these people who have given up paid employment to stay at home and care for their spouses. I know of cases where incontinence pads can be collected only on a particular day. In one case this meant if the home help could not go to the clinic on that day, the spouse had to lock the house securely, and even lock one room, to ensure his wife did not get hurt while he was out. While the intent of the legislation is good, we must ensure the message is transmitted down <Col N="326" /> the line to agencies such as the health boards not put in place impediments for those providing the care. We must also ensure the eligibility criteria do not present an insurmountable hurdle for the relevant persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGennis for sharing her time with me.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as yet another instalment in the Government's work to achieve a society where the needs of everyone are recognised, especially those of the most vulnerable.</P>
      <P>The proposals before us are unique as there are no similar models in the rest of Europe. It is refreshing to note that Ireland might lead the way in this area. Historically Ireland has had respect for the vulnerable and the old in our society and a tradition of caring for the needs of the sick and the infirm. As public representatives, like the medical profession we meet many of the unsung heroes in the community who give freely of their time to care for close relatives, sons, daughters, parents or partners. Historically the burden of this work was carried out by women. They spent a great deal of their time in the home, partly because that was the accepted tradition and there were not the same opportunities then for women to become involved in the workforce. Many people devoted their lives to care for a relative or a parent and when that person passed on they were left with a void in their lives.</P>
      <P>The position is different now. It is less likely that a member of the family would be available in the home to care on a daily basis for a relative who falls ill. With the cost of living today, many families consider it necessary for both parents to work to raise a family. There are large costs associated with taking time out to care for a sick relative and the cost may often be too much for a family to bear. With the increase in the cost of caring, the State has recognised that a form of income support is needed to assist or facilitate those people who want to or are required to care for a person on a short-term basis.</P>
      <P>Against that background of fostering the culture of caring for each other for future generations, the Government introduced legislation based on the carer's benefit scheme with effect from 26 October 2000. Under that scheme an employee who is entitled to carer's benefit may engage in limited self-employment within the home or employment outside the home for up to ten hours per week. The employee may also pursue an education or a training course or take up voluntary or community work for up to ten hours per week. The scheme provides that employees who have been certified by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs as meeting the eligibility criteria of a carer can take temporary leave from their employment to care for a person in need of full-time care and attention. The new benefit is payable for a period of up to 65 weeks, or 15 months, to those who meet certain qualifying conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="327" /> This insurance based carer benefit scheme is additional to the carer's allowance scheme, which has been in place for many years. The new insurance based scheme extends financial assistance for carers to a group who would not have benefited previously from the carer's allowance because they did not meet the strict means testing requirements. The new scheme means that any person who has been in employment for a specific period and paid PRSI contributions can qualify for a weekly grant of £88.50 for a period of up to 15 months.</P>
    <P>The original carer's allowance scheme was improved in the budget. The weekly income disregard of £75 for a single person and £150 for a couple from means assessment will be increased to £125 for a single person and £250 for a couple from 1 April 2001. That will enable an extra 5,000 carers to qualify for the carer's allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the increase from £300 to £400 in the respite care grant from June 2001 and the decision to pay two grants to a carer who cares for two or more persons. People who spend seven days a week constantly caring for someone are entitled to a break. Those measures have been introduced at an estimated cost of £21.2 million per annum. It is money well spent and I encourage the Minister for Finance and the Government to allocate further funds in the next budget to improve the position of carers.</P>
    <P>The overall aim of any Government must be to enable all our people to live an independent and fulfilling life. People's spirits are strongest when they are given the freedom to exert influence on how they live their lives. This is why the Government also improved the disability allowance in the budget. A full rate of disability allowance payment will be extended to a person whose partner is in receipt of any other social welfare payment from April 2001. This is also why eligibility for the living alone allowance of £6 per week will be extended from April 2001 to recipients of invalidity pension, disability allowance, unemployment supplement and blind person's pension for persons under the age of 66.</P>
    <P>This Bill is cast in the same spirit and it aims to make it easier for people to be cared for in their own homes by people who are willing to give of their time to look after loved ones. For many, nursing homes are a final resort and it is heartening that so many people display the human quality that drives them to take time out of their own lives to care for a relative who has fallen ill.</P>
    <P>The Bill complements the Government's financial assistance to carers by giving statutory entitlement to carer's leave. The Bill will entitle employees to carer's leave, protect their employment rights over the period of absence and allow them to return to their jobs. Carer's leave will not only complement carer's benefit but will be a significant independent right. It will enable people to take much needed time out to care for someone who has fallen ill. Up to now when sick<Col N="328" /> ness hit a family a person had to depend on the goodwill of the employer to co-operate by allowing him or her time off. While some employers would be helpful in such circumstances, others would not and, therefore, this formal right in legislation for employees is welcome.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on specific aspects of the Bill. I do not foresee a problem with the requirement to give six weeks' notice to an employer of an intention to take carer's leave. I fully recognise that the needs of an employer must be catered for especially as he or she may have to temporarily fill a position for up to 15 months. However, the need to take time off to become a full-time carer can arise in the event of sudden illness or accident. I ask the Minister to give that aspect of the Bill more attention.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that to avail of carer's leave an employee must be in continuous employment for 12 months. I do not understand the need for this restriction. An employer would be much more worried about giving leave to a person who has worked for the company for ten years than to a person who has worked for it for only six months. A person who has worked for a company for six months is not an integral part of it and his or her absence would not have as damaging an effect as the absence of a person who has worked for it for a longer period.</P>
    <P>There are other points I wish to make, but the time constraints that apply do not permit me to go into the detail of them. I welcome the Bill, although a few aspects of it concern me. It is innovative and I congratulate the Minister of State on introducing it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Bill which I welcome in general, although various elements are restrictive. Unlike the Government, the Labour Party is fully in favour of acknowledging the significant role played by thousands of carers. On Committee and Report Stages we will endeavour to make significant amendments to improve the Bill. Given that in opposition it promised the sun, the moon and the stars to nearly 100,000 carers, Fianna Fáil's failure to reform, in particular, the means test for carer's allowance is another scandal. The Government has merely tinkered with the payment and avoided any substantial reforms to the punitive means test for the allowance. It should also be noted that the net effect of this year's budget, for example, has been to make less than 5,000 extra carers eligible for the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparing my contribution to this debate I was of the view that it was necessary that the views of carers be heard in the Chamber. I have, therefore, decided to read extracts from the contributions of two carers to an edition of the <Col N="329" /><i>Carers' Newsletter</i> issued by CROSSCARE with which I have dealt, with other voluntary organisations dealing with carers, during the years. I express my appreciation of all the work done by them.</P>
    <P>The first contribution entitled, Carers' Needs, is by Eileen Flynn and reads as follows:</P>
    <P>It is about time that the Government and Service Providers listened to us Carers, because we are the people who know what we are talking about. It is we who have to deal with the day-to-day problems of caring as they arise. We have become experts in our fields, with knowledge and experience gained the hard way through trial and error and heartbreak.</P>
    <P>Most Carers don't choose to be Carers &ndash; we usually have that role thrust upon us and are, in most cases, provided with no alternative. We receive no training whatsoever and often we don't know where to turn to for help. There is a complete lack of information available, and unless you are lucky enough to know someone who has experience in caring, you are left completely in the dark. Doctors are too busy to sit and talk and advise you on the best course of action to take. The Public Health Nurses are excellent, but they are very busy people you feel you can call on only when you have reached the end of the road.</P>
    <P>This situation is most unsatisfactory. We need advice and information and we need it now. We need it to be given to us without having to ask for it. We need to know that there is somewhere we can go, like our local health clinic, and that there will be someone there to advise us, quietly and confidentially, about handling the present situation and what the future holds. We need assurances that we are not alone. We need that terrible fear of our own inadequacies that we all experience to be allayed. . . Because caring is so draining of the Carer's emotional and physical resources, Carers should be entitled to at least several free medical check-ups a year, and to complete medical cover where needed.</P>

      <P>It is dated February 2000 and I quoted from pages 12 and 13. The contribution of Mary Briody on page 9 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Who is a Carer?</P>
      <P>A Carer is one who is:&ndash;</P>
      <P>&ndash;Constantly on duty</P>
      <P>&ndash;Owned by someone else</P>
      <P>&ndash;Not supposed to become ill</P>
      <P>&ndash;Not able to plan her own day</P>
      <P>&ndash;Forever rushing home</P>

    <P>A Carer</P>
    <P>&ndash;Enjoys the company of other carers</P>
    <P>&ndash;Looks forward to respite.</P>
    <P>In the context of the role the State will play in providing for carers in the future this gives a flavour of their inner feelings.</P>
    <P>Due to medical advances life expectancy has increased. There are as a consequence many more people suffering from chronic illnesses and with a serious disabilities to be cared for. Carers in the home are expected to care for the chronically ill, the disabled and the independent older person and in so doing are offered very little support or practical help. There are at least 33,000 people suffering from dementia, 3,500 from multiple sclerosis, 5,500 from Parkinson's disease, 20,000 adults with an intellectual disability and over 5,500 wheelchair users in need of care. When one looks at the statistics one will see that there are between 100,000 and 200,000 carers.</P>
    <P>There has been a change in attitudes. Until recently the carer's role has been defined largely by traditional, cultural and religious factors incorporating ideas of self-sacrifice, duty and acceptance, but these attitudes are changing. While carers are emerging as persons who want to care for their loved ones, they are increasingly angry at the lack of recognition, services and support in their caring role. Despite the increasing emphasis on the value and importance of community care, expenditure patterns in the health service do not reflect the shift towards community care on which expenditure should be brought more into line with expenditure on hospital services given the savings that accrue to the State in providing care in the home.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an erroneous perception that a carer is somebody else. We are all potential carers. Who can say when, if ever, we will experience the emotional, physical or financial effects of caring for a loved one struck down by accident, illness or the effects of old age? Perhaps only then will we recognise what is needed in providing the proper level of care 24 hours a day, 52 weeks a year. That matter must be examined. While I accept that the Bill provides for improvements in the service, there is a long way to go. There have been improvements in rates of pay for those involved in the home help service, but it must be acknowledged that if suitable persons are to be recruited to provide home help, sufficient funds must be allocated to enable the service to expand and attract workers and to pay reasonable wages.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance should be a realistic effort to provide carers with the means to care effectively, not a reallocation of social welfare payments to those on low incomes, as appears to be the case. Carers should be recognised as professional partners providing care within the community and their work given professional status and remuneration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> The services needed at local level need to be examined. More funding should be allocated to provide for an adequate system of community care. This should include the provision of more professional workers such as public health nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, community social workers, care attendants and home helps. A liaison officer who would assess carers' needs and liaise between the carer and statutory services should be appointed within each community care area. A counselling and psychological service should be available to those who are cared for and to carers to help them to cope with the trauma of illness. An ongoing information service should also be provided.</P>
    <P>Close consultation between carers, as the primary providers of care, and service providers would result in a more efficient and cost-effective health service. This is only beginning to happen, which illustrates the failure to recognise the value of the carer's contribution to community care. Respite care is vitally important. The carer's ability to continue caring and to cope with life when caring ceases is very much dependent on him or her having a life and interests outside caring. Time off is necessary to enable carers to develop outside interests. Assistance is required in this regard. Carers also need to devote time to the other members of the family.</P>
    <P>My contribution highlights the major areas still to be addressed. If the role of the hundreds of thousands of carers in society is to be recognised, the financial contribution they have made must be acknowledged. They have saved the State millions of pounds annually. How is that acknowledged in a meaningful way? The carer's allowance should be dealt with effectively. At a time of unparalleled growth and prosperity it is scandalous that so few carers are in receipt of the allowance. The means test should be abolished. I look forward to contributing further on Committee and Report Stages.</P>

      <P>The Green Party strongly supports the introduction of the Bill because it is long overdue. It should have been introduced many years ago. Carers have been a long and lone suffering group. Many are in poor health as a result of the 24 hour non-stop caring regime. As Deputy McGennis said, we know many of them personally. They do a fantastic job, which is unpaid and unrecognised and which takes a great toll on many. Their lives have been ruined because of their work.</P>
      <P>The legislation was supposed to have been introduced in parallel with the carer's benefit payment introduced in last year's Social Welfare Act. Why has it taken almost a year for it to surface? Why has there been such foot dragging by the Government? Carers were left for a further year to cope with what are often desperate situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is imperative that proper data are collated regarding the number of carers in society. The <Col N="332" /> Government states that there are 50,000 family carers while the Carers Association states that there are at least 120,000 and perhaps as many as 200,000. A total of 16,000 were in receipt of any level of carer's allowance as of December 2000, of whom only half were in receipt of the full allowance. The bottom line is that an enormous number of carers receive no financial assistance from the State.</P>
    <P>Will the Government liaise with the Carers Association and other such organisations to establish an accurate figure for the number of carers in order that the level of assistance and what is required can be analysed and the assistance can be better targeted? For example, the National Council on Ageing reports that 32,000 people suffer from dementia in Ireland and their carers receive little help. It also estimates that there are 97,000 households in which a carer looks after a person aged 65 years or over. What additional resources can be provided to assist them?</P>
    <P>There are a number of positive aspects to the legislation such as allowing carer's leave to be taken on a flexible basis and the guarantee that the carer will have a job to return to, but why is leave only available up to 65 weeks? Figures indicate that the average carer's allowance is three and a half years and the Carers Association has lobbied for three years. The Tánaiste and her Department favoured three years, but that was blocked by IBEC. I appeal to the Minister of State to reconsider this issue and allow leave time of more than three years.</P>
    <P>The carer's benefit payment is unacceptably low. This will impact on those taking carer's leave. Carer's benefit is to increase to £92 per week, which is less than what is necessary. A carer who takes leave will suffer a major reduction in income. Carers provide a service not just for the individual for whom they care, but also the State. It is estimated that a carer saves the State approximately £300 per week on alternative residential care. The State is saved more than £1.5 billion a year through this alternative social service. The sum of £92 per week is derisory. It is also totally unacceptable that the carer's allowance is means-tested. It is time the means test was abolished.</P>
    <P>Why are partners not allowed to swap carer's benefit? The Carers Association has cited this fault, which will mean a great majority of family carers will not be able to avail of the scheme. The Bill also does not make it clear whether an employee's entitlements will be protected if he or she takes carer's leave. I seek clarification of this matter.</P>
    <P>We all agree that carers need tremendous support. Many are ill and in need of rest and recuperation. The payment, therefore, for respite care is too low. It is currently £400 per year. This should be increased considerably. Society owes it to them. We must look after our carers. If we are to function properly as a society and provide more social capital, we need to look after carers who <Col N="333" /> provide the service. I hope the Minister of State will clarify the issues raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is a move in the right direction. It behoves any state to appreciate the needs of those who require care in hospitals for the elderly, nursing homes or their own homes. The Bill deals with emergency situations, where a family member in need of care will not be admitted to a hospital for the elderly and where nursing home care cannot be afforded and he or she must, therefore, be cared for in their own home. The Bill shows an awareness of such emergency situations. I, therefore, compliment the Minister of State on introducing it.</P>
      <P>There is a reference to those in need of full-time care. As no carer can provide full-time care, I ask the Minister of State to exclude &ldquo;full-time care&rdquo; from all documents and schemes dealing with carers. No carer can do that. It means that one person must provide care 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That is how officials of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs view the provision. Recently I met a constituent who cares for her parent. The constituent cares for her parent, who lives two miles from her house, approximately five hours per day, but the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs turned down her application for carer's allowance because she could not provide full-time care. Five hours per day seven days a week is 35 hours. I ask the Minister of State to replace &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; care with &ldquo;essential&rdquo; care. If someone is providing essential care for a person who qualifies medically for the scheme and the Department is of the view that the applicant for carer's allowance is providing such care, the carer's allowance should be granted. There should be flexibility for those under huge emotional pressure in providing an indirect service for the State. Carers are looking after members of their families in their own homes. The Department should be more flexible and change the wording from &ldquo;full-time&rdquo; to &ldquo;essential&rdquo; care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all speakers for their contributions. I agree with Deputies that this is significant legislation, though the debate pales somewhat in the shadow of the devastating news received earlier from the Cooley Mountains in County Louth, with which the Acting Chairman will be familiar. I appreciate the solidarity and unity demonstrated across the board among those who spoke on this matter. It is unprecedented in my time in the House and very much appreciated. I am not just responsible for labour matters and the issue with which we are dealing, but also international trade and consumer affairs. I will be working, therefore, to redouble our efforts and focus on containing the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will impact positively on the lives of thousands of people in need of care. I have been looking at many of the suggestions made. <Col N="334" /> Deputies Ryan and Belton raised an issue which relates to another Department to which I will relay their views. We debated the Bill on 7 and 8 February also and contributions have generally been constructive and supportive of its thrust. Like any legislation, there is room for refinement on which I have consulted the social partners. There will be more consultation now we are coming to the final Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Contributions confirmed the deep interest of the House in addressing the problems of those in society less fortunate than the majority in their health and well-being. The debate reflected wide support for the intent of the Bill, which honours commitments made by the Government in the 2000 budget and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The parallel carer's benefit scheme operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has been in place since October last and the speedy passage of the Bill through both Houses is vital to ensure those employees who wish to avail of this new entitlement to carer's leave, and in most cases carer's benefit, can do so in the knowledge that in their absence their jobs will be secure and can be returned to when the leave period terminates.  </P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the carer's allowance scheme at length. This scheme is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, and the comments on the scheme have been brought to his attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed raised several issues relating to the Bill, including the question of whether superannuation rights of employees should be preserved during their absence on carer's leave. I will return to this issue on Committee Stage. Deputy Broughan and others spoke about the perceived effect of the means-testing of applicants for the carer's allowance scheme which has undergone substantial improvement since the Government took office and is a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. I have brought these comments to his attention. Deputy Broughan also raised the application of the Bill to teachers who are included in the Bill. While the Department of Education and Science has no objection in principle to the granting of carer's leave to teachers, it intends in due course to have discussions with management and teacher representatives to agree arrangements for the implementation of the legislation in so far as it affects teachers.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies Keaveney, Fleming, Ardagh, Michael Kitt, Martin Brady, Collins, Noel Ahern, Callely, Brendan Smith, Killeen and Pat Carey for their supportive comments. Deputy Keaveney stressed the need to balance work and home life. The Bill attempts to reflect this ongoing social change. Deputy Fleming reminded us that carer's leave is a new entitlement and stressed the important point that when the Bill is enacted, leaflets publicising it should be readily available, comprehensive and understandable to the public. That is something we will do. Deputy Ardagh <Col N="335" /> stressed the practical difficulties for small employers in facilitating the absence of valued employees on leave under the scheme while Deputy Michael Kitt raised the possibility of caring responsibilities being shared. Deputy Martin Brady reminded us of the improvements introduced for carers since the Government took office. The new Bill will improve quality of life for those who find themselves in these situations.</P>
    <P>Deputies Broughan, Ring, McCormack, Boylan, Neville, Currie, Belton, Penrose and Ahern raised a number of points on important technical issues. They included the proposed 12 months qualification period for carer's leave, the proposal that the leave must be taken in amounts of at least 13 weeks at a time, the length of the proposed carer's leave, the need for a six week notice requirement in cases of urgent necessity, the provision that there must generally be a 12 month break where different care recipients are concerned, the possibility of care responsibilities being shared, difficulties arising when leave terminates while the care recipient still needs full time care and attention, the possibility of annual leave and superannuation entitlements being preserved during absence on carer's leave, redundancy situations arising while the employee is on carer's leave, the right of an employer to refuse an employee entitlement to carer's leave of less than 13 weeks duration and whether this issue might be more appropriate for adjudication by a rights commissioner.</P>
    <P>Many important technical issues have been raised and these are appropriate for in-depth examination on Committee Stage. I will discuss them at that time. I am also aware that the social partners, ICTU and IBEC, seek a number of changes to the Bill which require further consideration. I hope to have met both bodies before Committee Stage to discuss their concerns. I will be favourably disposed towards any reasonable proposals which might emerge and which offer the prospect of improving the operation and effectiveness of this new scheme. With goodwill, suitable compromise can be achieved where this can be seen to be in the interests of making the eventual Act as user friendly as possible both for the persons providing full-time care and attention and the persons providing this valuable service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald recommended that we look sympathetically at some of the proposals in a submission made by FLAC on the Bill. I will be happy to do this. Deputy McGennis welcomed the family friendly nature of the Bill. It is crucial that the leave scheme be as accessible and family friendly as possible. Otherwise, it will not be taken up. Other points raised by Deputy McGennis are more suitable for discussion on Committee Stage. Deputy Michael Moynihan also welcomed the Bill and I am grateful for his support. He commented on a number of technical issues in the Bill and I will look at them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> Deputy Seán Ryan was critical of the means test for carer's allowance. This is not relevant to the Bill but I will bring his views to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs. Deputy Gormley, while welcoming the Bill, strongly criticised the resources made available to carers generally. I noted his comments. Deputy Belton welcomed the Bill and I will convey the issues he raised to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am pleased to introduce the Vocational Education (Amendment) Bill, 2000. We have witnessed in recent years fundamental and dramatic improvements to our schools yet it behoves us to remember that in this era of change the vocational education system has been an underlying strength of our education system, not just in this decade or the last but almost since the found<Col N="337" /> ation of the State. It was in 1924 that the then Minister for Education requested a committee on technical education to report to him on the question of provision for technical education. It was the recommendations of this report, published in 1927, that would lead in 1930 to the first Vocational Education Act.</P>
    <P>I will touch briefly on some of the key aspects of this new legislation which will update and modernise that system. We will have an opportunity to discuss the details of this legislation in more depth on Committee Stage and I look forward to the contributions of Deputies at that time.</P>
    <P>I bring this legislation forward with one central aim, to enhance the ability of each VEC to provide an ever better educational service to those students who are availing of its services and for future students. We must recognise that the educational landscape of today is very different from that of 1930; indeed, it is very different from that of 20 years ago. Legislation must reflect these changes. More importantly, it must reflect the reality that change and uncertainty are now essential parts of all our lives. This new VEC legislation cannot anticipate that change but it can create the legal environment to give vocational education committees the means to plan for change, the flexibility to enable them to respond to uncertainty and the authority to put in place effective and appropriate educational services for the needs of those they serve.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve this aim I propose a number of changes to four key areas of the current VEC legislation. This legislation will provide for a revision of the functions of vocational education committees, provide for a more inclusive membership in vocational committees, provide for more effective reporting arrangements within vocational education committees and between vocational education committees and the Minister and provide for an updated financial structure for the operation of the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most visible changes which have affected the VEC sector since the 1930 Act are in the terminology used to describe the functions of VEC schools and, even more fundamentally, in the functions that are carried out by such schools. The 1930 Act, developed at a time when school attendance was compulsory only up to 14 years and when general second level education was the preserve of a relatively small fraction of the population, envisaged a particular and relatively narrow role for the VEC school. The schools would engage in continuation education to supplement existing elementary education and technical education to assist in the development of the trade and craft skills that the industry of the day required.</P>
    <P>The VEC sector today performs a much broader role in a much more complex society. VEC schools are now an integral part of our second level education system, providing schooling for almost 100,000 students, nearly 30% of all second level students. VEC centres are actively <Col N="338" /> engaged in the provision of a wide range of adult education services, from basic literacy to certificate courses. Indeed, the Government White Paper on adult education has earmarked the sector for the development of a resourced and comprehensive adult education service. I will introduce amendments on Committee Stage to copperfasten these proposals.</P>
    <P>These developments have rendered outdated some of the provisions of the 1930 Act so I propose to bring this legislation into line with more modern concepts. While the existing function of the vocational education committees, as set out in the 1930 Act, will be retained, section 9 of the Bill before the House provides for a more complete description of the functions of vocational education committees, capturing the reality of their role in Irish education today and giving each VEC a general reponsibility to review, plan and co-ordinate the provision of education in their area.</P>
    <P>These changes, together with other changes to the way in which vocational education committees will plan their activities, particularly the education plan and service plan to which I will refer in a moment, will provide a new basis for the operation of vocational education committees, a basis which will tap into the tremendous potential of the VEC sector and allow it to be released for the benefit of the local community. Decision-making and responsibility in the VEC sector has always been vested at local level. This local involvement has always been perhaps the key strength of each VEC, and one that I propose to enhance further in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The 1930 Act made an explicit linkage between each vocational education committee and the local community. This linkage is most clearly obvious in the membership of vocational education committees. Each local authority would nominate the 14 members of the corresponding VEC. Of these 14, not more than eight would be members of the local authority concerned, while the balance would be drawn from a general constituency of local employers, tradesmen and others. Such a linkage reflects the thinking of the time. VEC schools had a clear commercial rationale, hence the need to ensure that the schools would be sensitive to the needs of local employers, and that students would have opportunities to take up employment in their own locality.</P>
    <P>That model of local representation remains valid. If anything, time has proved the foresight of the original architects of the VEC structures. Local involvement in public administration, and indeed any activity, is now a <i>sine qua non.</i> Such involvement harnesses local energies, directs activity towards genuine needs, and creates a sense of local ownership. In this age of multinational corporations, genuine local involvement serves to remind us that the ability to direct change still exists at the local level, and that local communities can steer that change to benefit their own community. The success of the local <Col N="339" /> area partnership groups which have played such an important role, particularly in combating long-term unemployment in areas of disadvantage, is ample testimony in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us will make certain changes to this model of representation, while remaining rooted in the principle of local involvement. We will now extend that principle of local involvement to provide for statutory recognition for the partners in education to become formally involved in vocational education committees. The Bill provides that in addition to local authority representation, there will now be a statutory right of representation on committees for both parents of students attending vocational education committees, and the staff employed by vocational education committees, including teachers. The Bill also provides that in addition, further categories of persons will also be considered for membership of each VEC, including students, representatives of voluntary bodies and local business interests. These broad categories will allow vocational education committees to continue to involve a breadth of interests from each local community in the operation of the VEC.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that this is in many ways only a minor alteration to what I have already noted is a very successful formula. It is important however that such changes be made. The Education Act, 1998, has already given the principle of partnership a statutory footing in the education system. That Act has given parents a new range of statutory responsibilities and rights, ranging from the recognition to local parents associations in each primary and post-primary school to their formal involvement in the preparation for new models for boards of management at a national level. Parents themselves have long sought that this principle of recognition should also extend to the VEC sector. I fully subscribe to that view and am happy to make this provision in this Bill. The parents of students attending VEC schools will therefore now be able to elect two representatives to become full members of each VEC.</P>
    <P>It is also appropriate that the staff of the VEC should also be entitled to such membership. The single most important attribute of any organisation is its staff and it is appropriate that their involvement should be formalised by distinct provision in the membership of the VEC. Therefore, in the same way as parents, the staff of each VEC will be entitled to elect two representatives to sit on the VEC.</P>
    <P>In considering amendments to the VEC legislation, I was very conscious that other sectors of local government have undergone considerable and beneficial change in recent years. These changes have, for example, helped health boards to undertake a new method for the planning of their annual work, through the mechanism of a service plan. At another level, local authorities have adopted a longer-term strategic framework for their work, through a system of medium term <Col N="340" /> planning, which allows for the identification of needs and the preparation of plans to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>Although it is perhaps an over used term today, strategic planning remains an essential concept for any form of public administration. The term itself originates in ancient Greece, where the <i>&ldquo;strategoi&rdquo;</i>formed a war council. The development of the term reflected developments in military technology to the point that warfare involved the complex organisation of a range of forces rather than reliance on individual ability and bravery.</P>
    <P>In many ways, the VEC sector continually faces problems of a similar scope today. The average VEC is responsible for students with a range of educational needs, ranging from the 12 year old just entering second level schooling, to the person in their early 20s completing a post-leaving certificate course, to the adult learner who is undertaking further study in any one of a range of areas. To meet these needs, the VEC has responsibility for schools, centres for education, and employs teachers and administrative staff. The VEC must also plan for the future needs of students, taking into account both the changing demands for education, and the changing needs of the local community.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes two important changes to allow vocational education committees to adopt new methods to deal with these strategic challenges. First, the Bill requires each VEC to prepare a service plan. The legislation provides that it will be prepared each year immediately after the allocation of resources by the Minister for Education and Science, an allocation which will be made after the budget. The plan will set out the income the VEC expects to receive that year, and how it proposes to allocate that expenditure. The service plan will also set out broad categories of service which each VEC will provide, and the estimated expenditure it will incur in providing that service.</P>
    <P>The service plan thus provides a complete picture of how a VEC intends to carry out its functions in the coming year. The Bill further provides that each VEC will also at the end of the year prepare a report on how it has carried out the objectives it has set for itself in the service plan the previous year. This will allow for full accountability in the operation of the VEC. Its operations and activities will be open to any outside scrutiny. This accountability will, I believe, give the local community a greater understanding of the role and activities of the VEC. Where those activities might be enhanced, or redirected, they will be able to so inform the VEC, thus creating a virtuous cycle of enhanced services.</P>
    <P>At a more general level, the Bill also requires a VEC to create an education plan. The function of this plan will be to set out a broad vision of the future activity of the VEC, spread over the coming five years. It allows the committee an opportunity to focus their attention on the overall development of their services, a focus which <Col N="341" /> might on occasion be sacrificed to the needs of the instant. Issues such as demographics, or population shifts, changing economic circumstances, or patterns of employment can feed into the thinking of the committee, to inform them in their plans for the future development of the VEC.</P>
    <P>The education plan will not be a document written in stone. Very few plans should so be. Instead, it will provide a broad canvas for the direction of the VEC, a set of principles to guide actions over the coming five years. Where circumstances change radically, the plan will be amended to take account of such change. I believe however that its core value will lie not so much in the details of any part of the plan, but in the opportunity it offers each VEC to develop and maintain an overall framework, a framework setting out the priorities of the VEC, as determined by the VEC following a process of consultation, and providing a strategic framework for their operation. I know that many vocational education committees already adopt such a framework on an informal basis. I trust that all vocational education committees will now seize the opportunity that this Bill provides.</P>
    <P>On revised reporting arrangements, this new structure will also be accompanied by the introduction of the reserved executive model in the VEC sector. Originally introduced in the management Acts, 1929-40, governing the local authority sector, this model is also now used in the health board system. Essentially, the model provides for a division of the policy and executive responsibilities of each VEC. The committee of the VEC will undertake responsibility for the management of overall policy direction. Thus, the preparation of both the service and education plans will fall within the committee's scope. While VEC officials may assist in the preparation or compilation of information, the formal adoption of these plans will be the charge of the committee. VEC officials will then be responsible for the management of the VEC's activities in order to conform to the parameters set out in both of the above plans.</P>
    <P>It is the specific responsibility of the chief executive officer to ensure the day-to-day operation and management of the VEC, known as executive functions, will be carried out in compliance with the directions of the committee. The chief executive officer will be accountable to the VEC at all times for such actions and will thus take responsibility for the ordinary running of the VEC's affairs and ensuring such affairs are carried out in an efficient and effective manner.</P>
    <P>The reserved executive model has proven itself to be both successful and durable throughout the remit of local government. It is based upon the essential and democratic precept that elected representatives are entitled to and responsible for setting out the policies and principles which should guide the organisation for which they are responsible. Those officials who are employed by the organisation are responsible for the effective <Col N="342" /> implementation of those policies and accountable to the representatives for any failure to so do.</P>
    <P>A further element of the Bill provides for the regularisation of the position of County Dublin VEC, the legal basis of which is currently governed in a somewhat <i>ad hoc </i>manner by the 1999 legislation dealing with Blanchardstown Institute of Technology. This arose due to a redesign of the local authority borders in the Dublin area which led to a departure from the traditional local authority-VEC area alignment. County Dublin VEC now extends to cover three local authority areas. The Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Act, 1999, made an interim provision for these three local authorities to elect the members of the VEC. It has been my view for some time that it is necessary to ensure this provision is replaced and the activities of County Dublin VEC, one of the biggest VEC schemes in the country, be placed on a more secure footing. The Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Act requires this as the provision expires this year. Accordingly, the Bill provides for such a basis for the operation of County Dublin VEC, enshrining as it does its geographical basis in law.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents the most significant overhaul of the VEC system since its foundation in 1930. The Bill is based very much on the strengths of the VEC system &ndash; local involvement and devolved decision-making &ndash; while providing the VEC structure with a more appropriate and modern set of structures with which to carry on its business. The Bill will significantly enhance the effectiveness of VEC and the quality of education being provided for VEC students.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a positive and constructive debate on the Bill. I am sure Deputies will offer amendments which I look forward to being able to consider on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill which is a welcome break for the Minister from the more difficult task he has on his hands. The Bill is largely non-contentious. Its purpose is to provide for new structures and procedures in order that individual vocational education committees can meet the needs of vocational education in their areas in as effective and efficient a manner as possible. The Bill's principal aims are the revision of the composition of vocational education committees to include representation on vocational education committees for parents of students registered in VEC institutions and VEC staff, including teachers. This is one of the more interesting aspects of the Bill and smacks of cronyism of the worst kind. Fianna Fáil's stranglehold on vocational education committees throughout the country will be copper-fastened by this provision which I urge the Minister to reconsider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other provisions in the Bill, such as the classification of the functions exercised by vocational education committees into reserved and executive functions, are not earth shattering <Col N="343" /> as this system has operated in local authorities and health boards for some time. The Bill also provides for additional functions for vocational education committees and revised reporting, accounting and financial procedures. Implicit in this is that the Department has learned from the misdemeanours and shortcomings highlighted in some vocational education committees in the past with people being hauled before the Committee of Public Accounts to explain their actions. I welcome such new procedures.</P>
    <P>While the Bill, in itself, is not offensive, the vocabulary used is somewhat dated. The explanatory memorandum states that the Bill's purpose is the provision of new structures to meet the needs of vocational education in the areas in which the vocational education committees serve. This smacks of a very dated approach to education. My experience in this area is based on Cork City and Cork County vocational education committees, both of which are at the cutting edge of innovation in education. The concept of &ldquo;vocational education&rdquo; in the original 1930s legislation which established vocational education committees is very dated. Some vocational education committees are very progressive providers of academic education, in addition to vocational education. One could ask whether there is a need for an overview of the Department of Education and Science and the possibility of its divesting itself of some of the functions it holds dear. That could result in greater democratisation of education and the enhancement of its delivery at local level.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Department, under the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Martin, threw the baby out with the bath water in the context of the proposed regional education boards championed by the former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, in the previous Administration. Regional boards, while not an ideal solution, offered the possibility of greater democracy and accountability in education at local level and a greater capacity to respond to local needs. This oasis in the sea of bureaucracy worked very well in certain areas, but we refuse to contemplate the next obvious step, namely, how to provide for a similar degree of accountability and necessary local involvement in the reform of the education system from parents, teachers etc.</P>
    <P>The Department recently commissioned the Cromien report to review its operations. The report made some suggestions in regard to the Department divesting itself of responsibility for organising the State examinations. That will be one of the items of reform which will be fast-tracked because it is probably the best lesson to be learned out of the immediate debacle of the ASTI dispute. The Department is creaking at the seams. It has undertaken the responsibility for all issues and not delegated responsibility for local issues. I know of a school amalgamation which has been in progress between the Department and the schools involved for nearly five years. If <Col N="344" /> this matter was left to parents, staff, local elected and unelected representatives, it would have been resolved long ago. It would also allow the Department more scope to apply itself to policy issues rather than being caught up in the day-to-day administration of education. The principal of a local national school or a post-primary school has to get departmental permission for new downpipes or new windows. There is no localised contact point. It is a constant two-way communication process between Tullamore or Athlone and the local school management.</P>
    <P>While this is a Bill to be welcomed the question must be asked, when will some of the Department's functions be farmed out? Dealing with these matters hinders the Department's ability to be an effective agent of policy change in education. It is a pity that the regional education boards were thrown out.</P>
    <P>My own experience of vocational education committees is confined to Cork County Vocational Education Committee and to a lesser extent, the operations of the City of Cork VEC. I think the Minister would agree that both are among the best in the country. I wonder why some VEC structures are dealing with perhaps one to three schools and others have between ten and 20 schools. I think there is room for greater efficiencies and the Minister has abdicated his responsibility in this regard. A strategic review of the functions of vocational education committees should also include those matters.</P>
    <P>Page 5, section 7 of the Bill deals with the composition of vocational education committees. We can see here the stifling hand of Fianna Fáil on local authorities around the country. A person cannot take up a position on a VEC, even though he or she may be the favoured nominee of parents or other interested groups, unless that person passes an interview test with the local Fianna Fáil councillors. That is regrettable.</P>
    <P>Section 7(<i>e</i>) provides for four members being appointed by the local authority after consultation with groups representing students, voluntary organisations and the local business community. This is a disservice to the best interests of all involved at local level in providing education through the VEC system. When this Bill is in Committee Stage, I urge the Minister to lift that withering hand of Fianna Fáil members on local authorities and prevent the meddling which is not in the best interests of the vocational education committees. It smacks of cronyism of the worst type.</P>
    <P>I also have concerns about provisions in section 7(<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>). Two members are to be elected by parents of students who are attending VEC institutions and two members to be elected by the staff of the VEC. It is not clear whether there will be ringfenced provision for teaching staff. Members of the teaching staff should be entitled to two representatives and one additional member should represent the non-teaching staff. Otherwise there will be possible hostility and <Col N="345" /> competition and associated unease between groups of people who have worked together in the best interests of the VEC.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the composition of the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee, and again in subsection (2)(<i>d</i>) it provides for the stifling hand of political involvement in determining who will become members of the VEC.</P>
    <P>We need to cement real partnership in education between the interested parties, parents and their children, teaching staff and elected representatives. I wish to speak in defence of the involvement of elected representatives in education. Those outside the VEC sector react when any attempt is made to talk about a democratic structure in education outside or embracing both the VEC sector and the non-vocational education sector and there is a reluctance because of perceived and indeed real evidence of political interference. That provision in the Bill will only give the opponents of democratisation and accountability a further stick to beat us with. Local elected members are a legitimate voice and are accountable directly to the public they serve. This provision for the vetting of members will do them a disservice. If we are serious about real partnership, then the partners in education should be given an automatic nominating right. Otherwise, it will be a politically driven vocational education committee system with all the worst consequences. I am committed to moving forward the agenda of greater democratisation and accountability. Others outside the VEC will use this as a stick to beat us with.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the functions of the chief executive officer and executive functions. A concern has been conveyed to me from within VEC circles that, during industrial relations difficulties, those directly involved would have had access to board members and independent arbitration. Will the Minister elaborate on the consequences of this section for dealing with industrial relations disputes? What avenues in the industrial relations machinery of the State will be available given certain provisions in previous Vocational Education Committee Acts which make specific avenues available to VEC employees to resolve disputes? Will unhindered access to independent arbitration be guaranteed?</P>
    <P>I do not have any further detailed comments. I have received a considerable volume of representations on the Bill from Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge which is interested in proofing the Bill from an Irish language perspective, something towards which we should be sympathetic. I have not yet analysed its submission in sufficient detail, but perhaps the concept is something the Minister might take on board.</P>
    <P>There is nothing hugely contentious in the Bill which is broadly welcome. The Department of Education and Science should examine placing further democratic accountability in the delivery of education at local level outside VEC structures and let us know of any plans it has in that regard. <Col N="346" /> Members regularly encounter the cumbersome process involved in a school seeking an extension or securing grant aid. If these matters were dealt with at local level, they would be handled more efficiently in terms of finance and time. The Department indicated that it takes six years from sanction in principle being given to the building of a new school or extension to the time the key is turned. For a post-primay school, that is an entire body of students who will have started and finished education before any new provisions are made. They are often educated in inappropriate or unsuitable accommodation, such as prefabs or overcrowded classrooms. These issues could best be dealt with at local level, either by expanding the remit of vocational education committees to cover voluntary schools or by the establishment of a parallel institution.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the baby was thrown out with the bath water when regional education boards were rejected. There is some light at the end of the tunnel in terms of what has been identified in the Cromien report. The Murray report, a review of vocational education committees, has gathered dust in that politically difficult issues raised within it were fudged. It is time we paid heed to putting in place an accountability structure for education to provide a forum for the partners in education outside the VEC sector to have a say in the running of education. That would leave the Minister with more time on his hands to deal with policy issues. There is some merit in the point that the ASTI dispute may not have reached its current impasse if the Department had been in a position to concentrate on issues best dealt with nationally while divesting itself of some of the issues which clog up the system and lead to inefficiencies and bureaucratic delays. I look forward to the Minister's reply and I am sure we will table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the publication of and debate on this long overdue legislation. There is no doubt that it is high time the vocational education committees were revamped and revised regulations and legislation dealing with them were put in place given that the primary legislation dates back to the 1930s, with minor amendments in the late 1930s and 1940s, and given the enormous change which has taken place in terms of student and parent expectations of education, additional funding being made available and the higher standards people generally are trying to achieve. There is no doubt that the original legislation is outdated and, in that respect, it is welcome to see amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has, however, adopted a conservative approach. This was a good opportunity to provide for a complete revamp of the VEC system, but the Minister has failed to do this or use this as an opportunity for introducing many of the recommendations of the Murray report which, as the previous speaker said, has been left to gather dust. There is considerable potential for <Col N="347" /> streamlining the VEC sector, amalgamating some of the smaller vocational education committees and rationalising the system generally. The opportunity has been missed in so far as no attempt has been made in the Bill to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill to broaden the base of representation of VEC members. I also welcome the move to provide on a statutory basis for the greater involvement of parents, staff and students. The Bill provides for new procedures, now commonplace in local authorities and health boards, covering the definition of functions and the distinction between reserved and executive functions. This is welcome and will provide for better accounting and reporting procedures and service and education plans. These are standard practices in other local bodies, such as local authorities, and it is long overdue that the same requirements were made of the VEC sector.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees have performed a very important role since the 1930s in the development of education and society. It is fair to say that they have many strengths, not least their willingness to be involved at community level, to be more open to the community and to cater for all students in their catchment areas. It has been an important aspect of VEC schools that they see themselves as providers of education for all children and that they have not adopted the exclusive and discriminatory approach adopted at times by the voluntary sector. Many vocational education committees have shown themselves to be extremely innovative, have been to the fore in taking on new programmes within the second level system and creative and inventive in so doing. That type of enthusiasm has been important from the point of view of the general well-being of the sector. There is a vibrancy, especially among teachers who have been very keen to tailor-make programmes, services and courses to meet the needs of the local catchment area. In the non-discriminatory way they have encouraged people to attend their schools, vocational education committees have played a very useful role.</P>
    <P>Their weaknesses must also be recognised, the principal one being that they have been over-politicised. This has led to a certain amount of cynicism on the part of teachers and other stakeholders in education. That cynicism and those concerns are well founded. This is particularly due to the way the Minister's party has exploited opportunities to gain control of a sector that was important in the community from the point of view of local public representatives. There is long history of jobbery associated with vocational education committees. We know from recent inquiries that issues concerning procurement procedures used by vocational education committees have warranted further investigation.</P>
    <P>To that extent, the role of public representatives in representing the electorate in the education system has been done a disservice by those <Col N="348" /> who set out to exploit the petty political opportunities which arose in the VEC sector. To some extent, the VEC has been given a bad name because of that. There are issues of credibility and confidence among teachers, and also among parents.</P>
    <P>The role of and the provision made for vocational education committees in this legislation are progressive in their representation of a range of community interests and in their assessment of education in a local catchment area. There are good principles in the legislation &ndash; the need to draw up education and service plans, the need to co-operate with other vocational education committees and the need to consult and work widely with parents and students within the catchment area. Why does the Minister not apply the same principles to the education system in general? Many of the principles in this Bill should be applied to the entire education system and those principles make a good argument for having a devolved system and local education structures.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Creed that this Administration should not throw out the proposals for education boards. I hope the Minister will look again at this matter, considering the findings of the Cromien report and the numerous instances where the Department of Education and Science has been unable to respond to local needs. There is no local information available to the Department for the reasons outlined in the Cromien report. According to that report, the urgent takes precedence over the important in the Department and there is little planning or policy work done. There is a considerable cultural gulf between those in the Department charged with taking critical decisions on education funding and the ultimate users of the education system and their parents.</P>
    <P>That cultural gulf and the absence at senior level in the Department of someone in a position to represent the Department at local community level has been highlighted by the Minister's inability to provide departmental representatives on local drugs task forces and on the newly announced RAPID programme which deals with disadvantage in the 25 most deprived areas. A key element of that disadvantage is education yet there is no representative of the Department at local level.</P>
    <P>The world has moved on and Irish society has moved farther than the Department of Education and Science. The principle of partnership has been accepted in the way business is done in many communities. There are many examples of the partnership that exists between local communities and other Departments, particularly the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform through the Garda and the Probation and Welfare Service. Those critical players at community level are represented in the various partnerships that exist, but the missing partner in <Col N="349" /> those fora is the Department of Education and Science. This is due to the Department's centralised structures and because it has no presence at local level. Such principles have been accepted for the VEC sector and it does not make sense that the Minister refuses to accept the need for them to be applied in a broader sense.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a requirement that vocational education committees consult with each other about the services provision. That is an important requirement but in practice it is more important for the VEC sector to consult with other sectors, particularly the primary sector, within the catchment area. This has been brought to my attention on numerous occasions by principals and staff at vocational education committees. There are real difficulties emerging in literacy and numeracy among children entering second level schooling, particularly in the VEC sector. They enter with inadequate reports from primary schools and in many cases it is not until half-way through first year that schools realise children are struggling with the ten subjects they may have in secondary school. It has been realised that many children have serious literacy and numeracy problems.</P>
    <P>One VEC school spoke recently of a 60% literacy problem for first year students. Half of those children were three to four years behind the normal standard for their age. Such a situation makes it virtually impossible for a VEC to give a proper service to those children. Unless there is consultation, co-operation and collaboration between primary and VEC schools in local areas, they are wasting their time to an extent.</P>
    <P>There are many missed opportunities. The nature and scale of the problem is apparent among first years at secondary level but the schools are helpless to do anything about it. There is no forum where secondary schools can raise their concerns with primary schools. If there were, there might be a concerted effort to deal with the fundamental problems of literacy and numeracy difficulties. There is a need to provide such a forum at local level so that the various sectors work together for the benefit of the children they serve. I appeal to the Minister to rethink Government policy on local education boards.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to section 3 of the Bill which concerns the commencement order. The Minister should clarify when he expects to sign that order. This is a problem with recent legislation. It is debated, agreed and passed, but there is often a long wait before the Bill comes into force. What is the Minister's intention for this Bill? </P>
    <P>Regarding section 7, the history of the vocational education committees is that they have been much too political. The Bill provides for nine county council members, two parents, two staff and four others. We must admit that in the past local councils appointed members to vocational education committees for reasons other than their interest or expertise in education. vocational education committees have many passengers and I hope the Minister accepts this state<Col N="350" /> ment in the spirit in which it is intended. All political parties must be honest about the fact that some representatives do not necessarily serve the best interests of the education system.</P>
    <P>The proposals in respect of the nine council representatives and the ability of local councils to make a further four appointments are undue powers for elected representatives. There should be a move towards a system where there is equality of representation from the council, community, staff and parents and other areas. This is why I ask the Minister to consider removing the power of appointment from local councils. The representatives of students, business, etc., are, in effect, political appointments and often they do not add anything to the composition or competence of the VEC. I ask the Minister to consider the proposal in the Murray report regarding a core group comprising elected members, councillors, parents and staff which would appoint the other representatives of students, business, etc. This would be a much fairer system and would safeguard against the over-politicisation of vocational education committees that occurred in the past.</P>
    <P>VECs employ a huge number and wide range of staff. There is much to be said in favour of the principle of equality of representation between parents and teaching staff and two places on the committees should be ringfenced for teaching staff. I also suggest that there should be a dedicated place for other staff. The reality of the Minister's proposal is that the two staff representatives will end up being teacher representatives. However, a wide range and large number of other staff are critical to the successful operation of vocational education committees, such as clerical, secretarial, caretaking, maintenance and other ancillary staff. They are part and parcel of the VEC sector and should have a voice at committee level. I urge the Minister to consider dedicated places for non-teaching ancillary staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned making regulations regarding the staff representatives. What are his intentions in respect of those elections and who will be eligible to vote in them? I hope and expect the Minister will ensure that the large number of part-time staff have a say. Anything other than that would be unfair; I urge the Minister not to limit it only to full-time staff. Provision should be made for including part-time staff and allowing their voice to be heard.</P>
    <P>Regarding the County Dublin VEC proposals, given that three local authorities are involved, the representation of councillors has been increased. However, the number of other representatives has not been increased. It is important to maintain the balance between public representatives and the representatives of the other partners. I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of increasing the representation from the other nominating groups.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 8, I ask the Minister to agree to setting an early date for the first meeting. It is important that vocational education committees <Col N="351" /> have a fresh start. There are many negative perceptions about the way in which vocational education committees operated in the past. The Bill is the perfect basis for the fresh start that is needed in terms of membership and I urge the Minister to ensure that happens quickly. He should not wait until after the next local elections for members to be appointed. It should be done within a reasonable time of the enactment of the legislation. It is also important to limit the term of office of members. There has been a dead hand where people have been members of vocational education committees for many years. New blood and fresh ideas are necessary on a regular basis. A level of enthusiasm and freshness must be maintained, although that has not always been the case with vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Section 15 relates to the chief executive officer's powers in respect of staff matters. There is a strong argument for taking such issues out of the hands of the committee, but the legislation appears to give the chief executive officer power as the absolute arbiter in staff matters. What are the Minister's views in respect of an appeal system for staff? Up to now, staff members who had difficulties with the chief executive officer could appeal to the VEC. I understand the argument for the Minister's proposal, but what appeal mechanism will be open to a person who does not get satisfaction from the chief executive officer?</P>
    <P>Section 26 deals with the five year education plan. However, that period is too long because things change rapidly in education. I would prefer the term to be three years. Regarding section 27, the principle of partnership is not being extended to the composition of the sub-committees. The Minister's party councillors have sought to take complete control of VEC sub-committees and I ask him to ensure that the sub-committees are covered in the legislation in terms of their composition and that the principle of partnership also applies in that area.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the provisions regarding the review of adequacy of services. It is important this review is carried out on a regular basis, similar to the health boards. I am not sure there is adequate provision in terms of examining gaps in services and an honest appraisal of the adequacy of the services being provided to meet the need that exists. We should be much more open and upfront in terms of identifying need. Given that the Department does not have a remit in that regard, it is most important that the VEC sector takes on responsibility for identifying the unmet need and gaps in services in their catchment areas. The Bill, as far as it goes, is welcome and I look forward to Committee Stage when I intend to put many of the ideas I mentioned into amendments.</P>

      <P>The Government has been advised by the Attorney General that an amendment to the Constitution is required before the State may ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. At a meeting held on 22 January last, the Government agreed that preparations should be put in train in respect of the referendum to be held in relation to the court. I arranged for the drafting of a Bill to amend the Constitution last year. This has recently been completed by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it is intended to seek approval for the text of the Bill at the Government's meeting on 27 March. Subject to Government approval, it will be presented to the Dáil shortly thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speedy ratification of the statute has been given a high priority by my Department. I am sure that the Deputy will agree that an amendment to the Constitution is an issue to which significant consideration should be given. In connection with the ratification process, apart from the need to amend the Constitution and, therefore, the need for a referendum approving such an amendment, implementing legislation will be required in order for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under this very complex statute. This legislation falls within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Only when such <Col N="353" /> legislative measures are in place may the State ratify the statute.</P>

      <P>My purpose in tabling the question was not to oppose the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. I favour ratification to the extent that I drafted and circulated a Bill on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. Why has it taken so long to begin the ratification process? The statute was agreed in Rome in July 1998 and signed a few months later. Does the Minister accept that, as one of the countries pressing for the statute to be adopted, there is an onus on us to complete the ratification process with the minimum of delay?</P>

      <P>The general situation regarding the ratification process is that the statute shall enter into force approximately 60 days after the sixtieth ratification. A total of 139 states signed the statute by 31 December 2000, the closing date for signature, while 29 states have ratified and acceded to the statute to date. This means that a further 31 states must ratify the statute before it can come into force. Early ratification of the statute is a priority for all member states of the European Union. To date, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Spain have ratified the statute. By reason of the requirement for a constitutional amendment, the matter needs detailed consideration. It is the intention of the Government to place it before the people with other issues, including the Treaty of Nice. The Bill will be placed before the Government next week after which it will be debated. It has been accorded a high priority and we have done the necessary work for a debate to take place in the House shortly.</P>

      <P>With other member states of the European Union, Ireland sought the statute and agreed to ratify it an early stage. We also called on other states to ratify it in order that we could set an example in getting the court up and running. This cannot be done until 60 states have ratified the statute. Approximately half have done so. Would this not have been an incentive to Ireland to show example, especially when the country campaigned to become a member of the UN Security Council? Does the Minister accept that a wait of two and a half year indicates that the issue was not receiving priority?</P>

      <P>Of the 139 countries to sign the statute, only 29 have ratified or acceded to it. We have a written Constitution and the statute requires a referendum. Other states, simply, had to enact legislation. Some still have that option, but have not completed that requirement. From our point of view, a more basic issue is involved, a referendum. If it was to be taken in isolation from other issues, the referendum could have been held, but it is the Government's view that we can meet our obligations in reasonable time by reason of having the statute put to a refer<Col N="354" /> endum at the same time as other issues. It is a matter of judgment and tactics. The international community is aware that this is our intention. We have flagged it as such and if it is agreed to hold referenda in the summer, I hope the referendum on this issue will be passed. It will then fall to the Oireachtas to introduce the implementing legislation.</P>

      <P>The Constitutional Court hearing, which took place in South Africa on 5 March, follows two years of legal action and discussion between the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, PMA, representing approximately 40 local and international drugs companies, and the South African Government. The PMA wants the court to prevent the implementation of section 15C of the 1997 Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment Act, which is intended to provide affordable pharmaceutical products for the South African population. The central issue is the PMA's contention that certain sections of the Act are in breach of the South African Patents Act and the country's international obligations under the WTO Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement, or TRIPS Agreement. The case, which is expected to last up to two years, is currently adjourned to allow the PMA time to respond to legal points raised by the Treatment Action Campaign, an AIDS activist group.</P>
      <P>From the outset of this epidemic, Ireland has recognised that the provision of cheaper drugs to combat HIV-AIDS is an important component of the fight against the disease. Political leadership, national prevention strategies and the long-term development of sustainable health systems are also vital. Ireland has pressed for the use of innovative measures to improve the supply of essential drugs. As long ago as January 2000, the Taoiseach wrote to the President of the European Commission, Mr. Prodi, pressing for an accelerated EU response to the AIDS crisis, and raising the issues of access to drugs for poor countries. We have continued to press this issue at EU level and measures to improve the supply of drugs at an affordable price are a key element of the new EU accelerated action policy to combat HIV-AIDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At UN level, we have used our membership of the Security Council to highlight the issue. In our statement to the Security Council on 19 January we called for an intensification of efforts by the <Col N="355" /> UN bodies, drugs industry and other relevant organisations to address the complex issues of access to medicines in developing countries with a view to overcoming the obstacles in that regard. We called for clarity about issues such as tiered pricing, compulsory licensing, parallel imports and the rights and obligations of both patent holders and signatories to international patent protection agreements.</P>
    <P>It is clear that HIV-AIDS is now the major development challenge facing Africa. The scale of the epidemic is unprecedented with up to 30 million people infected in sub-Saharan Africa. In South Africa, UNAIDS estimates that up to 20% of the adult population is infected. Against that background, it is regrettable that international drugs companies have decided to use the courts to try to block the efforts of the South African Government to provide cheaper drugs. I support calls for this action to be withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and the up-to-date information he has provided. Does the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid have the same opinion as the German Minister for Development Aid who has called on the drugs companies to withdraw their action in South Africa? Part of the difficulty with some elegantly written responses is that they appear to take every side and be in favour of apple pie. Ultimately, a choice must be made. Does the Minister agree that an interpretation of the TRIPS Agreement under the WTO is possible which will allow a licensing system for South Africa, India and Brazil? If he is forced to choose in offering an opinion in preparation for the WTO talks, will he side with the 20 million AIDS sufferers, or the ten million sufferers in Africa? If he is forced to choose between South African, Brazilian or Indian peasants and the pharmaceutical companies, will he side with the peasants? Does he believe that it is possible to align the position of the pharmaceutical companies with the needs of those who desperately require cheaper drugs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my reply to the initial question that we support calls for the withdrawal by the PMA of the court action which has the effect of compromising the ability of the South African Government to provide drugs at an affordable price to its people who are infected with this terminal disease. We are of the same view as the German Minister. If we can be proactive in terms of communicating that position, we will certainly do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want affordable drugs to be made available to people in developing countries. The legal issues in relation to patent rights, both under South African and international law, which have been raised in this case are complex. The TRIPs Agreement provides for the protection of patents. It provides legal certainty that the huge research costs of financial risks associated with the <Col N="356" /> development of lifesaving drugs can be rewarded through patent protection. The agreement recognises that a balance must be established between patent protection and issues which constitute a major national threat. The agreement allows Governments to take extraordinary measures to respond to crises such as the AIDS epidemic. Under certain conditions, including a national emergency, Governments are permitted to resort to compulsory licensing to produce patented drugs at cheaper prices. It seems clear that the current AIDS epidemic in South Africa, for example, qualifies by any standards as a national emergency. The commitment by the South African Government that it will implement the 1997 Act in a TRIPs consistent way is also welcome. I hope in that context that the adjournment of the court case will allow the drug companies to reach agreement with the South African Government on a way to provide for increased availability of affordable drugs. We support such an interpretation and believe the criteria are met in these and other cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply. On a related matter, will he use Ireland's membership of the Security Council to point to the contrast in the 1999 WHO figures and elsewhere whereby the total expenditure on preventable diseases is $15 billion per year, on armaments it is $885 billion and on television advertising it is $65 billion? In that context, will he agree that it is absolutely important the South African view, including the Indian and Brazilian view, succeeds? In Africa young people under ten have a 50% chance of contracting HIV positive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point on the contrast between the availability of drugs at affordable prices, the armaments industry and other issues. We made our views clear in a statement on 19 January. I will reiterate the Deputy's views when the issue is next discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I paid an official visit to Australia from 11 to 19 March at the invitation of Foreign Minister Alexander Downer. This visit was originally scheduled to take place in early February but was postponed due to discussions on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my visit I held talks with the Foreign Minister and a number of political leaders, including Premier Steve Bracks of Victoria, Premier Bob Carr of New South Wales, the Treasurer and Minister for Industry and Trade of South Australia, Mr. Rob Lucas, Minister Monica Gould of the Victorian Government and Mike Rann, the Opposition leader in South Australia. These discussions reflected the excellent relations <Col N="357" /> between Ireland and Australia at all levels and covered a wide range of bilateral and multilateral issues.</P>
    <P>My meeting with Minister Downer provided a welcome opportunity to review our bilateral relationship across a wide range of areas of mutual interest and our discussions were most productive. Minister Downer was very interested in the peace process and I availed of our meeting to bring him up to date on the latest developments. I also conveyed to Mr. Downer the Government's deep appreciation of the Australian Government's ongoing support for the Good Friday Agreement and, in particular, its contribution to the International Fund for Ireland since 1995.</P>
    <P>In view of Ireland's membership of the United Nations Security Council and the importance of Australia's perspective on regional developments, I took the opportunity of the meeting with Foreign Minister Downer to discuss and hear Australia's views on the situation in East Timor, developments in China and Taiwan, Indonesia, the Korean Peninsula, the Philippines, Thailand, and the South-West Pacific, including Fiji and the Solomon Islands.</P>
    <P>In addition, in a joint statement on 12 March, Foreign Minister Downer and I announced the establishment of the Forum for Australia-Ireland Co-operation as an important informal mechanism to assist the two Governments in deepening our bilateral relations. I believe the forum will play an important role in the further development of these relations.</P>
    <P>During my visit to Canberra I addressed the prestigious National Press Club and attended the St. Patrick's Day reception at the Irish Embassy. I also attended a meeting in the University of Melbourne to honour the patrons of the recently established Chair of Irish Studies by a gentleman from Mayo. In Sydney, I was the keynote speaker at the annual luncheon of the Lansdowne Club, one of the key Irish business associations in Australia. I also attended a range of St. Patrick's Day related events, including Mass and the annual St. Patrick's Day Ball of the Australian Irish Society.</P>
    <P>In all of my speaking engagements, both public and private, I took the opportunity to underline the fact that, at the time, there had been no outbreak of foot and mouth disease in our jurisdiction and to explain the stringent measures introduced to combat foot and mouth disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I see benefits in ministerial and parliamentary representation abroad, particularly at a time when the Irish diaspora are celebrating St. Patrick's Day. How do the Minister and the Government establish priorities? I understand that approximately 17 Ministers and Ministers of State travelled abroad, yet there was no ministerial presence at the crucial Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on Monday. That meeting was dealing with war in Macedonia, on the borders of Europe and preparing for the <Col N="358" /> special summit, beginning tomorrow. The Minister may have had a reason for not attending but why was the Minister of State or some other Minister not present?</P>

Good and all as the permanent representative may be, he is an official. Will the Minister accept this was a serious error given that war on the borders of Europe was being discussed and a strategy was being put in place to deal with it, apart altogether from the special summit taking place in Stockholm tomorrow?</P>

The idea that my non-attendance in any way diminished the points we wished to make on the issues is incorrect and it is erroneous to make such a suggestion. Unfortunately, I could not attend the meeting. It is probably the first meeting I have missed. This has not diminished the Government's position being <Col N="359" /> articulated.

      <Quest>if he expressed to President Mugabe the Government's concern about the abuse of human and civil rights by his Government in Zimbabwe; if the Government is still providing assistance and development aid to this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8166/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The continued instability in Zimbabwe remains a matter of deep concern to the Government. Over the past 12 months the situation has deteriorated significantly. The Government has made its views clear to the authorities in Zimbabwe through our Ambassador in South Africa, who is accredited to Harare, and through the European Union.</P>
      <P>The June 2000 parliamentary elections were preceded by a period of violence and intimidation, including the widespread illegal occupation of farms. The elections were marred by serious accusations of misconduct. While tensions eased somewhat in the months following these elections, the situation remained volatile. There were several outbreaks of serious violence towards the end of 2000 and the further deterioration of Zimbabwe's economy continued to exacerbate existing social and political instability.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, the situation has shown no sign of improvement in 2001. There have been a number of disturbing attacks on white farmers, including the murder of one farmer and his mother; intimidation of the press, including the forced expulsion of two foreign journalists; opposition figures continue to face harassment and intimidation and the independence of the country's judiciary has been dangerously undermined by a number of government interventions. These developments only serve to threaten the country's democratic credentials in the run up to next year's presidential elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Along with our EU partners, we have consistently called on President Mugabe to put an end to the violence and intimidation and to ensure full respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law. These concerns were most recently expressed on behalf of the EU by Com<Col N="360" /> missioner Nielson at a meeting with President Mugabe in Brussels on 5 March.</P>
    <P>We have urged the Zimbabwean Government to establish a constructive dialogue with the opposition and have stressed the importance of guaranteeing all parties their democratic right to operate freely. It is essential that the right of the people of Zimbabwe to express their views openly and without fear of violence should be respected. I also firmly believe that bipartisan co-operation and respect for democratic principles are essential if the serious economic and social difficulties facing the country are to be overcome.</P>
    <P>On 26 February, the EU's General Affairs Council agreed to engage in an open and focused dialogue with the Zimbabwean authorities under the terms of the Cotonou Agreement. I strongly support this initiative. Through this comprehensive and balanced dialogue the EU hopes to be able to promote a stable democratic political environment in Zimbabwe and, thereby, also contribute to peace, security and stability in the country. We will ensure that our shared concerns regarding political violence, respect for democratic principles, freedom of expression and freedom of the press, land reform and the economy, are fully articulated during this dialogue.</P>
    <P>Zimbabwe is not a designated priority country for Ireland Aid, although the country has received Irish support since 1980.  Our activities in Zimbabwe are valued at £600,000 for 2001 and focus heavily on poverty alleviation through meeting basic needs such as the provision of clean water. Much of the programme is implemented by UNICEF. The promotion of respect for human rights and democracy has informed the Ireland Aid programme since its inception. Given that the programme as it stands addresses the basic needs of the severely impoverished majority population of Zimbabwe and that funds are not routed through central government, we intend to complete this current and final phase of the programme.</P>
    <P>Ireland was a long standing supporter of the Zimbabwean independence movement. We, therefore, deeply regret the current instability in the country. The Government is determined to support all peaceful efforts to resolve these difficulties and to ensure that the democracy, which the people of Zimbabwe worked so hard to achieve, will develop and prosper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his strong reiteration of my views that the violation of human and civil rights under the Mugabe's regime is a disgrace, given the support President Mugabe got over the years, particularly in the early years of Zimbabwe's independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What sanctions, if any, letters, or indications have been given to President Mugabe that the relationship he enjoys with the EU may not continue in that consideration will have to be given to withdrawing the ambassadors based in his country if he continues his programme of violation of human rights? In representing <Col N="361" /> Ireland as a member of the Security Council, what efforts has the Minister made to have the issue of the violation of human and civil rights raised at a Security Council meeting? Could any action be taken on that front to stress to President Mugabe the world's disgust at what he is doing? Is the Minister aware that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, our former President, wrote three times to President Mugabe raising the issues of these violations and has not even had the courtesy of a reply? Why is the EU not more aggressive in its approach to President Mugabe to ensure he understands he will not be diplomatically feted and welcomed if this programme continues?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the violence emerged in preparation for the last presidential election and subsequent to that, the EU has had a strong position, which I outlined in the body of my reply. We are also engaged in trying to redress this situation. The interests of Zimbabwe and its people are not best served by simply adopting a condemnatory approach and then not engaging to ameliorate the worst aspects of how things are being done there. There is a need to engage to seek improvement. There is a dialogue in place and it has provided us with framework and a forum to address the issues about which the Deputy and I share concerns.</P>
      <P>I also welcome and support the statement of 7 March of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, and we support the views she expressed in her statement. In all of those, a consistent approach has been adopted by us individually and as a member of the European Union where there is a common position.  </P>
      <P>I am not aware that the issue has arisen since our accession to a seat on the Security Council in the past ten weeks, but I will check on that and revert to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>As Deputies will be aware, following several months of intensive discussions, the two Governments &ndash; led by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair &ndash; and the pro-Agreement parties in Northern Ireland met in Hillsborough on 8 March. While our talks did not enable us to reach a complete and comprehensive resolution of the issues we face, we had a very useful and productive exchange of views. Throughout a long day, it was obvious that, although several continue to face difficulties within their respective constituencies, all of the pro-Agreement parties remain firmly committed to securing the full implementation of the Agreement and are acting <Col N="362" /> in good faith in their efforts to secure that outcome.</P>
      <P>At the end of our discussions, the two Governments issued a statement setting out a framework for continuing work, which would help increase momentum behind the implementation of the Agreement, and we urged all concerned to respond positively.</P>
      <P>Our statement welcomed the IRA's announcement that it intended to enter into further discussions with the International Commission on Decommissioning and expressed our view that discussions should start promptly and should lead to agreement on the ways in which arms will be put completely and verifiably beyond use. We also said that we looked forward to receiving early and positive reports from the commission.</P>
      <P>The IRA's announcement that it has since met with the commission is, therefore, to be welcomed. However, as I have said before, it is important not only that these discussions take place but that they lead to meaningful progress. A positive report from the commission would make an important contribution to building confidence and to enabling us to make progress across the range of issues.</P>
      <P>There can be little doubt that continuing progress on the scaling back of British military installations, particularly in some high profile and sensitive locations, will also help us to unlock difficulties elsewhere. In our joint statement, the British Government restated its commitment of May 2000 to continue progressively to take all the necessary steps to secure as early a return as possible to normal security arrangements, consistent with the level of threat, on which it will consult the Irish Government.</P>
      <P>Our statement also acknowledged that there is an issue to be addressed in relation to supporters of organisations, now on ceasefire, against whom outstanding prosecutions in relation to offences committed before the Agreement remain in place. Such people would, if convicted, stand to benefit from the early release scheme under the Agreement. We accepted that, in the context of implementation of what was agreed at Hillsborough last year, it would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to be pursued and that we would intend as soon as possible thereafter to take such steps as are necessary to resolve this difficulty.</P>
      <P>Our discussions over recent months have enabled genuine progress to be made towards achieving the type of police service envisaged in the Agreement &ndash; one capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole and which young people from all backgrounds can feel comfortable about joining. As our statement made clear, the two Governments are fully committed to that vision and are aware of concerns as to whether the British legislation and plans for implementation respect the letter and spirit of the Patten report. Discussions will now continue with a view to reaching agreement, hopefully, by June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> Our statement reiterates that it continues to be essential that the full operation of the institutions under the Agreement &ndash; including the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council &ndash; resume and that the institutions continue their important work. Therefore, the Governments undertook to do all in their power to sustain their full operation, including during any formal review of the Agreement should that prove necessary. We also called on others to do likewise.</P>
    <P>We will continue to work closely with the British Government and with the pro-Agreement parties in the period ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Like him, I welcome the progress that has been made but I regret that in certain areas the progress has been limited.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I would agree that policing is a central issue. While I welcome the SDLP's response in terms of the progress it accepts has been made, will he indicate whether Sinn Féin is still insisting it cannot agree to a policing solution without changes in the legislation? Surely it knows that is out of the question, particularly with the Westminster election on the horizon. Why is it insisting on changes in legislation, if it still is? Will the Minister indicate why the emphasis is on June? He mentioned June in his reply and I have heard it in other quarters as well.</P>
      <P>In relation to putting arms beyond use, I welcome the renewed meetings with de Chastelain but regret that the IRA said it had met him to &ldquo;set the basis for discussions&rdquo;. Surely things should be far beyond setting the basis for discussions. It is rather like talks about talks at this stage.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister met relatives of the Omagh victims the other evening. Will he indicate whether he supports the civil action they are taking and would he encourage people to contribute financially to that? The Minister referred to what are described as the OTRs, those on the run, and the partial agreement in relation to that. While such agreement is being reached on those people on the run, will he indicate what the republican view is to the return of those who have been exiled by that movement? People have been forced out of the country, sometimes for no other reason than they had a disagreement with the local provo mafia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the policing question, a lot of the discussions on the outstanding issues are linked in that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. A very intensive attempt was made since the new year to try to get a comprehensive agreement on all these issues. It is true that there are still outstanding matters as far as Sinn Féin is concerned that would require some legislative change. It is true to say that it is unrealistic that would happen before the forthcoming British election expected to be held in May. The reason <Col N="364" /> June is mentioned is that we have had a lot of these discussions already and we hope to complete our discussions by June. We are, therefore, into a new parliamentary term &ndash; it is post-UK election time. The question of whether we can come to a comprehensive agreement that will meet the requirements of everybody remains to be seen but that is the idea in terms of the discussions which are ongoing.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Currie, more than many others here, would be aware, the arbiters of whether we have what is required in relation to policing will be the people on the ground. While I welcomed the publication of the police Bill last summer, I felt there were areas in which work would need to be done and improvements would have to be made. The adversarial nature of the legislative process meant that some amendments by the SDLP were accepted while others were not. Some very critical amendments were not accepted. They remain to be accepted. There has been progress in respect of certain matters and there has been an ability to discuss, in the context of the implementation plan, issues which might be addressed through that vehicle rather than having to be addressed legislatively but there are others that probably require some legislative change. There are certain commitments and understandings on various issues including flags, emblems and other matters which are, as the Deputy would be aware, of crucial importance in terms of whether people recognise there is a new beginning in relation to policing. There are outstanding issues in relation to cases which are well known, on which the SDLP has a particular view and which have yet to be addressed adequately as far as it is concerned. There is a number of issues.</P>
      <P>As regards the Sinn Féin issues, the question of the accountability mechanisms, how they interact, the powers of the chief constable and the powers of the police board, there are still some discussions in the areas for improvement. Similarly, as the Deputy will know, the issue of district police partnerships is important from its point of view. Basically, we are continuing discussion to try to see if we can sign off in a way which will bring about acceptance by everybody that the policing issue has been dealt with. It is correct, as the Deputy said, that it is of central strategic importance to the success of this peace project. It is, therefore, important that we get it right. The discussions have brought some measure of progress. Improvements have been made as a result of these discussions taking place but more discussion is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the de Chastelain Commission, while we welcome the resumed contact, it is important that we make serious headway in getting agreement on how this issue will be dealt with. One reverts back to the position on 5 May last year when for the first time we had a statement from the IRA confirming the circumstances in which this can happen. The question of full implementation of the agreement in all its aspects is central to the successful outcome of that issue. The discussions we have had since the new year have brought back into focus some of the out<Col N="365" /> standing issues. Clearly, if sufficient progress is made on how this matter will be handled &ndash; that is, in a way that will reinforce public confidence, will be transparent and will be satisfactory to everybody as a genuine verification that arms are being put beyond use &ndash; it will greatly enhance the prospects of resolving other issues like normalisation.</P>
    <P>Clearly the policing and disarmament issues will be central to bringing about normalisation. It is not a question of equivocation or equivalence, it is a question of everybody being satisfied that the outstanding issues will be satisfactorily dealt with. The OTR issue has proven to be a difficult one to resolve legally and appropriate. I reiterate what the Taoiseach said to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday that, of course, we call on everybody to be allowed to return to Northern Ireland without fear of repercussions. That is something that will continue to be put by the Governments to the parties concerned so that the peace process is there for everybody and not just some.</P>

As far as those on the run are concerned, the Minister said there were complications, and I understand that. There are no legal or similar complications in relation to the IRA and the return of people it banished from Northern Ireland.

In relation to the prospect of any further legislative change, the question of the review of the legislation is a matter that is already part of the thinking in the Patten report. Agreement has to be reached as to how these outstanding issues will be dealt with. Commitments from the British Government on how it is going to do this will determine the positive or other response from the Nationalist parties generally. That applies to both the SDLP and Sinn Féin. We must continue to work on these issues. While we have made some progress, we are not there yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 10, 11, 15, 36 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided, on the basis of the Attorney General's advice, that a referendum will be required to allow Ireland to ratify the Treaty of Nice. Work on drafting the necessary legalisation is in hand and it is hoped shortly to publish a Bill containing the wording of a constitutional amendment. It is the intention to hold the referendum before the summer. It is understood that in other member states decisions on ratification are likely to be taken by the respective national parliaments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the process of providing objective information for the public about the new treaty, a White Paper will be published next week. This will provide a factual account of the background to the negotiations and the decisions taken in Nice. It is intended that the White Paper, and a concise summary of the White Paper, which is also in preparation, will be widely distributed so as to facilitate access by the public to information on the treaty. In addition, it is envisaged that, as <Col N="368" /> with the previous EU-related referendum in 1998, a referendum commission will be established with a mandate, as provided for in the relevant legislation, to disseminate information concerning the treaty.</P>
    <P>As regards the post-Nice agenda, it will be recalled that in Nice it was agreed that there should be a broadly based discussion on the future development of the Union, leading in due course to a more detailed consideration of a number of issues, including the distribution of powers between the Union and the member states; the future status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights; the simplification of the treaties; and the role of national parliaments in the EU framework.</P>
    <P>While giving immediate priority to the ratification of the Nice Treaty, which, as I have indicated, will involve a referendum, and the expected accompanying public debate, consideration is also being given to how Ireland's contribution to the wider debate might best be organised. Given the emphasis on ensuring the debate is representative and broadly based, it will be important to ensure all relevant interests have an opportunity to put forward their point of view, and we will be considering a range of options to help achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>While these developments, which are on the agenda for the Gothenburg European Council in June, have yet to be discussed in detail at the General Affairs Council, I had the opportunity to review progress in this area at my recent meeting with the German Foreign Minister, Joscka Fischer. In stressing our commitment to closer co-operation within the EU framework, I emphasised that the Government intends to participate constructively in the ongoing debate. We both looked forward to contributing to the development of the Union in order that it was capable of meeting the challenges of enlargement, while remaining responsive to the needs of its citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify whether the decision to hold a referendum is a political or legal decision? Is the decision based on the advice of the Attorney General or is it a political decision to hold a referendum, which would be a plebiscite rather than a referendum? It has been mentioned that the referendum will be held on 31 May. Does the Minister anticipate that the onset of the foot and mouth crisis which has befallen the country will upset that arrangement? It has been suggested that four referenda should be held on the same day. I favour availing of the opportunity to place more than one issue before the people on the same day. Does the Minister foresee any danger to agreement on the Nice Treaty referendum by placing it before the people with three other issues? Is there a danger it could affect a positive outcome to that referendum?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Attorney General advised that there is a need for a referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is a requirement for a referendum. I do not believe in holding one for any other reason. The assessment of this morning's developments will continue and the situation must be monitored. The arrangements outlined were based on us not experiencing an outbreak of foot and mouth disease as intimated at yesterday's Whips meeting. A case has been confirmed and we must assess the situation. The planning continues apace, however, until a decision is taken to the contrary.</P>
      <P>I do not believe holding four referenda on the one day will be a source of confusion. People are interested in supporting Ireland's membership of the Union, providing for its enlargement, ratifying the international criminal court and abolishing the death penalty from our Constitution. We have gained support on these issues and I look forward to a good debate when the legislation relating to these issues is brought forward and listening to what everyone has to say. A broad measure of opinion is supportive of the Nice Treaty, which provides for effective decision-making and the political imperative of enlargement to proceed at pace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparations for the recent Intergovernmental Conference and the Nice Treaty were woefully inadequate in terms of public consultation. How has the Minister concluded that there will be a constitutional referendum rather than a plebiscite? If there is to be a constitutional referendum, he will, probably, reply that words will be inserted in the Constitution. What are the words and with what aspect of the treaty will they deal? My difficulty is that the Government has indicated its attitude to the treaty by signing it. The European Parliament has yet to reach a conclusion on the treaty. The Government proposes to hold what it calls a referendum and others call a plebiscite before the summer and before the European Union has reached a conclusion. This is woefully confusing. The Minister referred to preliminary discussions in other European countries. They have all concluded there is need for wider consultation between now and the next Intergovernmental Conference in 2003 and that citizens must be <Col N="370" /> involved. What is the Minister going to do about that?</P>
      <P>If there are three referenda, dealing with hanging, the International Criminal Court and discipline of the Judiciary, then there are clear constitutional requirements. There is one on which opinions have been offered that might or might not be legally required and in any case the Government has signed the treaty. The Minister is creating a situation in which there is a huge chance that people will not be sufficiently informed by public debate on all aspects of this matter. How is the Minister going to select the aspect he is going to put before the people or will he put the entire treaty before them? Does he agree there is enormous merit in treating the Nice Treaty separately, publishing a White Paper, beginning the work of consultation for the next Intergovernmental Conference and doing this properly? I do not understand this because some of the Minister's colleagues have described what will happen as a plebiscite. If there is a plebiscite, the Minister has said he is against that. If there is a plebiscite or a constitutional referendum, why not on a separate day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the Government indicated that we would have the four referenda on the same day and we do not believe that confusion will arise. We will have to agree to disagree on that.</P>
      <P>We have referenda when they are constitutionally and legally required. The legal advice the Government receives comes from the Attorney General and he has indicated that this is required. We are still in the deliberative process in that the referendum Bill is coming before Government next Tuesday. As soon as it is approved it will be published on the Thursday. We can then have a proper debate on it and it will be clear; we can discuss our views then. It will be transparent and available for all to see in due course once the Government approves it. As a former member of a Government the Deputy will know that until it is approved there is not much point in talking about it. The legal advice from the Attorney General is that a referendum is required and because of that we need to have a referendum.</P>
      <P>I am making my position plain. I do not believe in having a referendum for the sake of having one. We have a referendum because we are required under the Constitution to have it. If the legal advice was, as in the case of Denmark and other member states, that it would be possible to ratify the Nice Treaty simply by legislating for it in the Oireachtas, that would be the course of action I would propose to Government and ask it to agree on. The fact is that our Constitution requires a referendum and the wording and approach will be similar to that taken last time. The discretions involved which are being changed require a constitutional yes vote from the people to safeguard this against legal challenge and we will proceed on that basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that having the four referenda on the same day is a deliberate attempt to muddy the waters? Does he accept that a full copy of the final Nice Treaty is not available to Members in the Dáil Library? Will he also provide, when providing the treaty, the declaration on European security and defence policy and its annexes? It is part of the Presidency report. The annexes are vital as they spell out the relationship between the EU and NATO, which is something the Green Party is very interested in.</P>
      <P>Why have we had such a delay with the White Paper? We had the White Paper six months before the Amsterdam Treaty. If the Minister wants a full debate why has he delayed so long in providing this? It seems to be further evidence that he does not really want a debate on the issue but wants to hurry it through. Regarding the legal advice from the Attorney General, is it not the case that the reason we require this referendum is the enhanced co-operation articles in the Nice Treaty? Before this there was a veto because of Amsterdam. Is it not the case that this veto is now to be removed and that is why we require this referendum?</P>
      <P>How can the Minister expect the Referendum Commission to do its job with four referenda in the timescale he has outlined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept for a moment that there is any attempt to muddy the waters. I look forward to a debate, particularly with the Deputy, on a number of issues. That would be good for both of us.</P>
      <P>I will check immediately on what documentation is available and whatever is available should be in the Library. I will arrange for that. Regarding the legal issues involved, it would be helpful before we debate the Bill itself if the Joint Committee on the Constitution, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, had a day's debate on the matter to enable everyone to discuss the legal issues involved. We could have a proper debate there before debating the Bill in the House.</P>
      <P>Regarding he publication of the White Paper, we must await, as I said here before Christmas following discussions on the treaty, the legal texts being finalised. That will require the Attorney General's views legally once he has the texts. The White Paper simply outlines the factual position as a result of negotiations having been completed in December and we are producing it within two months of that. That is not a delay. It will be informed and people can take whatever view they wish.</P>
      <P>There is no attempt to muddy the waters on my part. I look forward to the debate, which I hope will be constructive and informed. Clearly there are differences of opinion between us on a number of opinions. Let the people hear those clearly. I have every confidence the Referendum Commission will do its job in relation to these referenda.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister lay the legal advice regarding the basis for a referendum on the Nice Treaty in the Library? There is confusion and it has been indicated to us on this side of the House that this is perhaps being held for political reasons so that the Government can push it away from criticism. I do not mind the people having a say in it but it would be good to know the legal basis on which the referendum is being held, such as which section of the Constitution is being amended.</P>
      <P>In view of the anti-European statements made by a number of Ministers and the actions of Ministers like Deputy McCreevy, regarding sanctions by the European Commission as a result of our budgetary position, does the Minister agree that publishing the White Paper on one day and taking the legislation two days later is not conducive to wide ranging debate among or interest from the general public? By the time the general public gets the White Paper the debate will be over and the legislation passed.</P>
      <P>How does the Minister propose to circulate the White Paper? Will it be dropped into every household throughout the country? In view of the foot and mouth outbreak today and the fine work done by groups like the Irish European Movement &ndash; and anti-European groups &ndash; in the debates before such referenda, will there be a problem if we go ahead with these referenda at the end of May? People may be confined in areas and public meetings may not be held, so we will not have the kind of debate that is needed. There is the risk of a low turnout and a decision against the treaty, which would not be a good decision. Does that risk exist and is it being taken into consideration? </P>

      <P>As I said, I expect the Joint Committee on the Constitution to have the opportunity to discuss these issues and their legal aspects. I will inform the committee and the House of the basis on which we are bringing forward the legislation, the way we are doing so, what Article is being amended and so forth. That can be dealt with in a transparent way. We are taking the legal advice of the Attorney General and that is the basis on which we are proceeding. We will outline that basis in due course, once Government has formally approved the Bill. We must await the deliberative process to be completed by Government. That will happen next Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the date, we can proceed with the publication of the White Paper and the taking of the Bill with the agreement of the House. There will be a debate in the Dáil and the Seanad. What determines the date of the referendum, once the Bill is signed, is when the order is signed by the Minister for the Environment and Local <Col N="373" /> Government. There is a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 60 days from that time to hold the referendum, so we can proceed with the legislative process and the debate involved without that dictating the date of the referendum.</P>
    <P>Developments today have to be monitored and assessed. We must look at the situation but we can do certain work without prejudice to any of that.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the all-party committee on the Constitution which is chaired by his colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan. I am vice-chairman of that committee. The committee met this morning to discuss this and other issues. Does the Minister not accept that the real problem is not informing the Members of that committee or of the House on the legalities involved &ndash; we can look at the Attorney General's opinion &ndash; but to have the issues understood by the general public? We need an informed general public to make an informed decision. This is where the real imperative lies. Will he take on board a view discussed in the all-party committee this morning, that there might be televised public hearings to which we would invite people from both sides to debate the issue? Would the Minister support that approach?</P>

I share the deep sense of frustration and disappointment held by the Deputy, the local community and, most pointedly, the family that the perpetrators of this heinous crime have not yet been brought to justice. Like the Deputy and the family, I want to see them brought to justice.</P>
      <P>I understand that while seven persons were arrested following the murder, no one was charged in relation to it. The murder inquiry is still ongoing but I understand that there have been no recent developments. I know that the family continues to have concerns, both about the conduct of the investigation and in relation to the future conduct of the inquest. On 20 March, the family lodged an official complaint with the police ombudsman and they await the establishment of an inquest.</P>

      <P>Ireland is a member of the Security Council and is on the Angolan sanctions committee but we have contact with the Iraq sanctions committee. Is the Minister satisfied that this amount of money is held undistributed while there are at least 3,000 children per month, <Col N="375" /> according to the lowest figures of 16 agencies, dying in Iraq? Is it true that, through the committee 661 procedure, there were up to 302 contracts in relation to health, 50 in education and 123 in higher education unfulfilled at the time these funds were being held? Most importantly, what initiative is Ireland taking to break the US-British block on so many of these contracts when there is such great humanitarian need?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a direct answer. The Deputy has put his question statistically for the purpose of putting it on the Official Record but I do not have that figure available. We are all concerned about the holds on applications in the sanctions committee. I am confident this issue will be one of the first to be addressed by the Security Council when it re-examines the question of sanctions and the implementation of the oil for food programme. It is an issue I will return to in my statement to the House later this evening.</P>
      <P>According to the UN Secretary General's most recent report on the operation of the UN humanitarian programme for Iraq, the programme contains all the necessary funds for Iraq to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi population. Unfortunately, Iraq has not fully utilised the funds available. That is the view of the UN Secretary General. It is important that the Iraqis improve their access to these funds but clearly it is also important that the holds and delays which have taken place in this programme are removed in respect of those humanitarian assistance programmes which are clearly for the benefit of the Iraqi people who are suffering because of the lack of focus in the sanctions policy against the regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will utilise my ten minutes later for the more general aspects of this issue. The Minister refers to the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan's, most recent report on Iraq. That report also points out the huge scale of the contracts, evidenced by the figures we have mentioned, that are held up in the New York account. It also mentions the delay with the submission agencies and points to the fact that even in the case of those sums that have managed to get to contract, they have supplied defective equipment, out of date medicines and do not supply in such <Col N="376" /> a consistent way as would provide a medical care programme for children and adults.</P>
      <P>We can return to this but ultimately the question is what proportion of the figures is affected by the block of two countries on the committee? What precise action will the Minister take to change the position in view of the fact that his colleague the French Minister has issued a statement saying that he cannot stand over what is taking place and he regards it as immoral? </P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I met him and discussed this issue with him in some detail. Our position on this is quite clear.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one brief question. Does the Minister accept that on the figures he presented to the House that there are over $4 billion available and unallocated and that clearly all the evidence confirms that both the UN Security Council and the Government of Iraq bear complete responsibility for the current humanitarian disaster in Iraq?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that a recent delegation assessed that the amount of humanitarian aid from this fund that has gone to Iraq amounts to the princely sum of $3 per person per month? This is clearly the reason 500,000 children are assumed to have died since the imposition of sanctions. Only $3 per month, per person is being put into Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply refer everybody to the report in full. I do not wish to be accused of picking bits and pieces of it. People may read the whole of it. It speaks of urging the Iraqi Government to increase its daily average rate of oil exports under the programme to at least the levels in the previous phase. At the same time great amounts of money have accrued over time and are at present available for the purchase of humanitarian items but Iraq is choosing not to draw down much of this money. That is also in the report. I am not here to defend the delays in humanitarian aid to the Iraqi people. I simply make the point that the Iraqi regime can improve the situation. The idea that they cannot contribute to improving the situation is erroneous. They <Col N="377" /> can. The manner in which this is handled also raises the issues of making sure that humanitarian assistance gets through and that there is not this wide interpretation of dual use. I have made this point clear to everyone I have met. The Irish Government does have a clear position on this and we will do all we can within the Security Council and with others to improve this situation. We recognise that there are responsibilities to be met by a number of people including the Iraqi Government themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 24, 27 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the active promotion of full observance of universal human rights standards, including opposing and seeking the elimination of all contemporary forms of slavery. Contemporary forms of slavery include practices such as the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography, the exploitation of child labour, the sexual mutilation of female children, the use of children in armed conflicts, debt bondage and trafficking in persons.</P>
      <P>I welcome Trócaire's initiative to highlight the issue of contemporary forms of slavery as their Lenten campaign this year and I support the aims of the campaign. The Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, has met representatives of Trócaire to discuss the campaign and ways in which the Government can support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> Slavery and human rights issues in general are normally considered by the UN bodies which have a specific role and expertise in this area, notably the Commission on Human Rights, which is currently in session in Geneva, and the International Labour Organisation &ndash; ILO. Our delegation to the Commission on Human Rights has been asked to examine ways in which the issue of contemporary forms of slavery can be addressed in the work of the commission. The primary responsibility of the UN Security Council is the maintenance of international peace and security. I would like to assure the House that Ireland's approach to all issues before the UN Security Council is informed by our commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights.</P>
    <P>Another appropriate UN forum for discussing the bonded labour question, one of the forms of slavery which Trócaire has highlighted, is the ILO. My colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has also met representatives of Trócaire to discuss bonded labour and has undertaken to take into account the issues raised in making our national preparations for the ILO annual conference in June 2001.</P>
    <P>The protection and promotion of the rights of all human beings is the first responsibility of every government. The persistence of contemporary forms of slavery, a most fundamental abuse of human rights, presents a challenge to all Governments. Highlighting and addressing this issue, with the assistance of organisations like Trócaire, is a priority for the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you. I know the Minister shares my abhorrence at the fact that in our modern world we still have an estimated 27 million people in slavery or bonded labour. Would the Minister consider some proposals as to what we could do? As a member of the Security Council would he put forward a motion that we could have slavery inspectors, like weapons inspectors, to assess the amount and effect of slavery on people round the world? Not many Governments support slavery but nevertheless it does exist, particularly in India. Would the Minister consider bringing in legislation to ban products made using slave labour? Finally could he agree with other State Departments to set up a body to trace where products originate and whether they are produced by slave labour? Is the Minister aware that many chocolate, tea, sugar, coffee and similar products are produced by slave labour? We must take a lead on this and the Minister himself should take a lead on it in the Security Council.</P>

Can he tell the House that during Ireland's presence on the Security Council a specific motion that will break new ground in relation to vigilance and prohibition will be discussed? Related agencies of the UN, such as the ILO, have discussed it before but it has not been discussed in the related body of the WTO. Can he give us an assurance that there will be a specific initiative by Ireland at the Security Council itself on this matter? </P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Ceann Comhairle's permission, I propose to answer Deputy O'Keeffe's question and that tabled by Deputy Penrose together. I have <Col N="380" /> informed the House of my reaction to the confirmation earlier today of two cases of foot and mouth disease in County Louth and of the immediate steps I am taking by way of instructing our diplomatic missions abroad. Since 20 February when the outbreak of the disease was confirmed in Britain, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and his officials have been in close contact with their opposite numbers in Britain, both at bilateral and EU level. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, met the British Minister, Mr. Browne, in Brussels as recently as Monday last. He is also in very close contact with his counterpart, Ms Bríd Rodgers, in Northern Ireland. These intensive discussions with the British and Northern Ireland agriculture authorities will continue and cover all aspects of this very serious situation, including the measures enforced to contain the spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>The Government is fully supportive of these efforts which represent the best hope of bringing the disease under effective control on these islands. I will meet my British colleague, the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, at the European Council in Stockholm later this week and impress upon him the importance we attach to the urgent need to contain and eradicate the disease in Ireland and the United Kingdom as quickly as possible. The Taoiseach today raised this question directly with Prime Minister Blair. I will avail of every suitable opportunity to impress upon the British authorities our grave concerns about the outbreak of the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that Britain is, almost certainly, the source of the infection? Does he further accept that the disease is, clearly, not under control in the United Kingdom and that no effective measures have been taken to prevent the spread of the disease there? Will he, at a minimum in his discussions at the European Council with the Foreign Secretary, seek disinfection programmes at all exit points in the United Kingdom for all goods and passengers travelling to Ireland? I hope the Taoiseach will do the same in his discussions with the Prime Minister. Does the Minister accept that this is the minimum we could expect at this stage from the UK authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will urge the British authorities to ensure maximum vigilance to prevent the further spread of the disease. The question of specific controls is a matter best dealt with by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, who is in constant contact with his veterinary and administrative staff who have front-line responsibility for dealing with the issue and are doing so very well. The confirmed outbreak in County Louth is disappointing and we must ensure there is co-operation in the attempt to prevent the disease spreading. I under<Col N="381" /> stand from the information which is emerging that the outbreak in County Louth is more likely to be a secondary outbreak from the Meigh outbreak rather than a separate infection. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is best placed to deal with control measures as it has the necessary expertise, knowledge and wherewithall to so do.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I will ensure our diplomatic missions are kept fully informed of the up-to-date position and will ensure trade is not affected, in so far as it is possible to do so. The EU Standing Veterinary Committee is due to meet tomorrow and we will make the point that this matter should be dealt with on a regional basis, as has happened in regard to the outbreaks in France and elsewhere. We hope that will be the agreed outcome of tomorrow's meeting. Such an outcome would, clearly, help our diplomatic missions to make the clear case that the outbreak is confined and being addressed and that the Minister signed further stringent measures and orders this morning in regard to the extension of the surveillance area.</P>
      <P>The Department is in constant daily contact with its British counterparts in regard to measures which can be taken to prevent the spread of the disease. As I stated, the Taoiseach has raised the matter with the British Prime Minister and I intend to raise it with the Foreign Secretary. We are all at one on the seriousness of the situation and will take every reasonable step to address it.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister understand the British psyche on this problem, as evidenced by Prime Minister Blair who stated yesterday in the House of Commons that people should continue to visit the countryside? The British seem to adopt a different approach to dealing with the issue. Professor Anderson, an expert commissioned by the British authorities to examine the outbreak of the disease in the United Kingdom, predicted yesterday that it will be worse than the 1967 crisis, not peak until May and not be eliminated until August at the earliest. In view of this are we to continue to be at risk of further spread of the disease from the United Kingdom? I do not want to be anti-British about this, but we must demand the imposition of measures which will guarantee, as far as possible, that there will be no further spread of the disease here from Britain.</P>

      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy and assure him that we will make those points to our British counterparts. I, too, was concerned to hear the prediction that the disease will not peak until May. The situation in the United Kingdom is of serious concern. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is dealing with the issue <Col N="382" /> bilaterally and taking every possible precaution to prevent the spread of the disease. The number of outbreaks in the United Kingdom and the forecast that they might be continue are very worrying and we will impress upon our UK counterparts the need for them to do everything possible to resolve the issue speedily, in their own interest as well as ours. Members can be assured that we will continue to take every possible measure to eradicate the source of the infection of the disease which, unfortunately, has been confirmed in County Louth. In the meantime, we will continue to take whatever precautionary measures are necessary.</P>

      <P>I apologise for my late arrival. Deputy Penrose also tabled a question on this matter which sought to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to outline what representations he has made tothe British authorities in view of the increased danger posed to this country, highlighted by the outbreak in County Louth. The British statements made in recent days and weeks emphasised the importance of striking a balance between the areas affected by foot and mouth disease and the more general aspects of the British economy, particularly rural tourism. As recently as yesterday, the British Prime Minister appeared on television announcing that the British countryside had not been closed down. The Irish countryside was effectively closed down with the cancellation of sporting events etc. I do not know whether the Minister has clarified whether he will have an opportunity to indicate to his colleagues at the upcoming summit that they have a broader obligation than that of merely ensuring a balance within their own economy. The epidemic proportions of the disease in the United Kingdom now pose a threat to another country. The balance that must be struck is not an internal balance between the tourism aspect of our own economy and the restrictions and slaughter that has been put in place, but also the danger that it represents to our country. We are all trying to be of assistance in this House. However, people are expressing a grave dissatisfaction with the disciplines that they now will wish to continue and the difference between those and what is taking place in the United Kingdom. It is difficult to reply to the suggestion from a member of the public that if a regime as stringent as ours had been undertaken in the early days of the disease in Britain, perhaps we would not be in such great danger now. The suggestion is almost that we had only to speak about agricultural consequences in Ireland and that we did not have a related economy. However, our related economy has been suffering deeply, and it will suffer more. Will the Minister use the occasion of the Stockholm conference to emphasise these points to your colleagues and report back to the House? </P>

      <P>In view of the cavalier fashion with which the British Government dealt with this, will there be discussions about movement of people from certain areas in the United Kingdom? At the moment there is no travel embargo. Something has gone wrong in the disinfection area and perhaps this has not been sufficient to prevent the disease given that we now have two cases. These cases seem to have emerged after the incubation period of four weeks. It seems therefore that the disease has entered this country subsequent to the Carlisle shipment. Will the Minister be discussing travel embargoes from certain areas of the UK?</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom had a cavalier attitude towards the control of the epidemic in their own country.</P>
      <P>Given the EU reaction to Austria, when the EU decided it did not favour one of the partners in government there, and given the threat posed by the actions of the United Kingdom to our country's economy and well-being, will the Minister call for criticism of the UK and its actions to be made at EU level? </P>

      <P>The two main points of entry into Ireland are through Larne and Holyhead. Traffic through Larne will have travelled through Dumfries, Galloway and the Cumbria area. Holyhead in Anglesea is the other main port. I believe that boat loads of fertiliser are coming in through the port of Drogheda and, except for disinfection mats, no preventative measures are being taken. We need to put pressure on the UK to ensure that this is taken seriously. The Minister has an important role to play as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the Minister insure that the United Kingdom is made aware of its obligations? Otherwise, the disease in Louth will be only the beginning of our problems.</P>
      <P>I have another more local but equally important question for the Minister. There is an area of County Monaghan known as Drumoley and I wonder if this area has been ceded to County Fermanagh. The Border patrols are only in the southern part of that parish and people in that area feel very vulnerable. Will the Minister clarify that if an outbreak happens in that area it will be classified as part of the Republic?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach spoke to Prime Minister Blair today in relation to these matters. I confirm that officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs working in our embassies will be monitoring reaction and comment and relaying it back to us and will ensure that there is no misrepresentation of our position. The expert group set up by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is advising him on the measures that need to be taken. The expert group is meeting today and the Minister will listen to all recommendations as to what further steps need to be taken. The issues of non-essential travel will be assessed by the expert group which has the expertise and knowledge and can assess the risk.</P>
      <P>There is a need for increased competence at EU level on the whole food safety issue. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development were in touch with Commissioner Byrne yesterday and today and will do so on an ongoing basis. These are matters which arise from both the BSE and foot and mouth incidences. The need to gear up at European level and synchronise and co-ordinate a response is clearly of great importance.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> Regarding my contacts with the United Kingdom Foreign Secretary and the Taoiseach with the UK Prime Minister as we approach the European Council meeting, the House can be assured that we will communicate the seriousness with which this is viewed in Ireland and the need for fullest co-operation possible between both administrations, North and South and Ireland and Britain. While this matter is not on the agenda, it may arise in informal discussions at the European Council. Should the matter be aired either bilaterally or by the Council, the Taoiseach will detail that discussion when reporting to the House on his return on the outcome of the Council meeting.</P>

We have already taken important steps today, including a risk assessment. Have there been any other adverse comments from our EU trading partners on the impact the disease might have? I understand there may already have been contact from Austria. Has there been any other contact given the possible political impact the outbreak of the disease may have?</P>

    <P>Will the Minister undertake an intense diplomatic initiative to ensure countries in Europe and beyond recognise the major efforts we have made over the past month to keep the situation under control? I understand there will be a meeting tomorrow of the EU veterinary council. Is it likely that, like the French and Dutch, we will be successful in having the matter regionalised, probably initially to County Louth or some variant, instead of the country being treated as a <Col N="386" /> whole?

We are hopeful, based on initial soundings, that this matter will be regionalised as a result of the EU veterinary council meeting tomorrow. It is a science based committee and we must await the outcome of its meeting. However, we are hopeful that we will be treated similarly to the French and others who have suffered similar outbreaks. I will meet the UK Foreign Secretary, Mr. Cook, tomorrow at the European Council meeting and will discuss this matter with him in the same way as the Taoiseach has already discussed the matter with the UK Prime Minister today. The House can be assured that we will seek to defend the national interest in as proper, appropriate and determined a way as would be expected given the seriousness of the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in Iraq, especially the enormous hardships faced by its people, is of major concern to the Government. I welcome the exchange of views on Iraq which took place in the Seanad on 8 March and I am pleased to be able to take up the issue again in this House. A number of Deputies tabled questions on Iraq for reply today which were not taken due to the decision to hold this debate. I intend to address the substance of those questions in this statement.</P>
      <P>There are two separate but closely related issues which lie at the heart of the debate on Iraq. There is the urgent issue of the humanitarian crisis there and the terrible suffering of its people, as witnessed at first hand by members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs during their visit last December. There is also the question of the approach the international community has taken over the past decade to address the proven threat to international peace and security posed by the Iraqi regime following its aggression against its neighbours, especially Kuwait. This approach is set out in the decisions of the UN Security Council which detail the commitments required of Iraq and also established the sanctions regime as a response to Iraq's failure to meet those commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the UN Security Council, Ireland's approach to the situation in Iraq is informed by both these issues. We want to see an end as soon as possible to the suffering of the Iraqi people and we wish to see the government of Iraq co-operating fully with the United Nations. The international community remains deeply concerned at the threat which Iraq's efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction pose to its population, to regional stability and international arms control efforts. Iraq has said that it is no longer pursuing such weapons programmes and that it has nothing to hide. The international community has asked Iraq to commit itself to independent UN verification to show that this is the case. If Iraq is telling the truth, <Col N="388" /> then the right step would be for it to agree to international arms inspections on the basis of the decisions of the Security Council.</P>
    <P>However, until such inspections take place, the jury must remain out on the question of whether Iraq maintains or seeks the capacity to build and use weapons of mass destruction. If recent media reporting that Iraq carried out a controlled nuclear explosion were to be verified, it would give rise to serious concern. The International Atomic Energy Agency is responsible for inspections in Iraq under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and under special mandate from the UN Security Council. In 1991 the IAEA uncovered evidence of clandestine uranium enrichment and nuclear weapons programmes in Iraq. However, it is not in a position to verify whether any nuclear device was tested. IAEA activities relevant to UN Security Council resolutions have been suspended as a result of a lack of co-operation on the part of Iraq which has not complied with the semi-annual reporting requirements of the IAEA's verification and monitoring plan.</P>
    <P>The reason the sanctions regime is in place is because of the failure of the Iraqi Government to co-operate with the UN disarmament supervisory commission. Security Council Resolution 1284 provides for the suspension of sanctions in return for Iraqi co-operation. Ten years on, in the light of the level of human suffering in Iraq, it is valid to examine whether the current economic sanctions regime is effective or has become counterproductive. Sanctions are maintained as a measure to prevent the Iraqi regime from gaining access to weapons and other military hardware and to encourage Iraq to co-operate with the United Nations. They were never intended to cause unacceptable hardship or suffering to the ordinary people of Iraq. They were intended as a measure to help protect the Iraqi people and their neighbours from a criminal regime.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the no-fly zones in Iraq were established originally to protect the vulnerable Kurdish populations in the north of the country and the Marsh Arab population in the south from attacks by the forces of Saddam Hussein. Those populations remain vulnerable to threats of force from the Iraqi regime. The issue of the legality in international law of the no-fly zones and the recent military action in Iraq by the United States and Britain in support of these zones needs to take due account of this reality. There is, unfortunately, no agreed view in the Security Council on the issue. The United States and Britain argue that the establishment of the no-fly zone arrangement is legally justified on the basis of the provisions of a series of UN Security Council Resolutions 678, 686, 687 and 688. Other members of the Security Council contest this interpretation. On the basis of the legal advice available to my Department and given that none of the Security Council resolutions concerned unambiguously <Col N="389" /> authorises the no-fly zone arrangement, it appears that no definitive legal interpretation is possible.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the basis or otherwise in international law for the recent attacks by the United States and Britain on Iraqi military installations carried out in the patrol of the no-fly zones is also unclear. What is important, however, is that the Security Council does not view these particular legal issues in isolation. A comprehensive, constructive and forward-looking examination is required, which seeks to solve the various issues in the broad context of the entire approach of the Security Council and the international community towards Iraq.</P>
    <P>Let me express, clearly, the Government's position. We recognise that the decisions of the Security Council are binding in international law and must be respected by all members of the international community. We also recognise, however, that those decisions are not set in stone and should be reviewed when the original circumstances change or where there is compelling evidence that the measures concerned are not effective. We accept the reality that progress on the issue can only be made where there is agreement by all five permanent members of the Security Council. We are actively involved in efforts to facilitate such an agreement on an urgent re-examination of the question of sanctions taking into account their humanitarian dimension.</P>
    <P>We want that re-examination to result in a comprehensive and early solution which would impact as little as possible on the lives of Iraq's civilian population. The economic and development needs of the Iraqi people do not have to be put on hold pending full compliance by Iraq with the Security Council resolutions. We want to see a system in place which would allow these needs to be fully met within the constraints required to ensure Iraq does not further develop weapons of mass destruction or threaten its neighbours. We recognise, however, that, as long as sanctions remain in place, there is no alternative to the oil for food programme in providing for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. We support the analysis and recommendations of the UN Secretary General on the range of constraints and difficulties which must be overcome to ensure the effective implementation of the programme.</P>
    <P>First and foremost, Iraq must live up to its responsibilities to fully utilise the funds available and co-operate in ensuring the necessary assistance reaches those most in need. Additionally, the members of the Iraq Sanctions Committee must work to improve the existing fast-track mechanisms and reduce to a minimum, as soon as possible, the unacceptable number of applications on hold. The green list established for automatically approved goods should be expanded to include all items except those with a clear military application.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> We support the continuing discussions between the UN Secretary General and the Government of Iraq and hope these will restart a process of dialogue and co-operation. These positions and concerns of the Government have been expressed at the Security Council and are well understood and respected by all the parties concerned. Gaining support for a comprehensive re-evaluation of sanctions was one of the main objectives of my recent discussions with permanent members of the Security Council. In the capitals which I visited, including Washington, Moscow and Paris, and also my visit to the United Nations in New York, there was a common recognition of the importance of such an exercise. In putting forward Ireland's position at first hand I was able to inform positively the policy reviews under way in these key capitals.</P>
    <P>From the outcome of my meetings there is an emerging view, including on the part of the new US Administration, in favour of examining possible new approaches to the continuation and implementation of sanctions. I am hopeful that this will include the approach favoured by Ireland. I anxiously await the outcome of the policy reviews in Washington and elsewhere. I have instructed Ireland's Security Council delegation to play an active and constructive role in bringing this issue forward in New York and to work in the Security Council and the sanctions committee to ensure progress is made in taking the necessary additional measures to eliminate the humanitarian cost of the sanctions.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to provide substantial assistance for the people of Iraq. In addition to our regular contributions to the UN funds and programmes operating in the country, Ireland has provided a total of 596,000 in bilateral humanitarian assistance during 1999 and 2000. Most recently the Government provided £100,000 from Ireland Aid to the International Committee of the Red Cross for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of health, water and sanitation facilities. Since 1997 the European Community Humanitarian Office has disbursed over £21 million in assistance to Iraq focusing on the most vulnerable and basic needs, in particular those of malnourished children. The ECHO is due to engage in a major fact finding and needs assessment mission to Iraq in April. With our UN and EU partners and in conjunction with the Iraqi authorities, the Government will continue to strongly support these and other practical measures to ensure the urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance to children and other vulnerable sectors of the population.</P>
    <P>UN economic sanctions, whether applied against Iraq or any other state, should interfere minimally with the everyday lives of the general population. They should not interfere at all with the importation of goods needed for humanitarian and essential civilian use. Sanctions should <Col N="391" /> focus on the regime, not the people. They should be applied, wherever possible, only to those items where there is a real risk of military or similar misuse.</P>
    <P>The Government wants to see the circumstances necessary for the lifting of the sanctions against Iraq altogether. All this requires is that the Government of Iraq meet its commitments and demonstrate, with concrete evidence, its peaceful intentions, especially with regard to its neighbours. I look forward to that day of reconciliation between Iraq and the international community. More immediately, I look forward to hearing the views and concerns of other Deputies on this complex and tragic issue. I welcome the close interest and concern which the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is continuing to give to the situation in Iraq. The recommendation which Deputy O'Malley, as chairman of the committee, forwarded to me last week is helpful and I will reply to it shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Owen.</P>
      <P>My concern is that the Government has focused on Utopian solutions as highlighted by the Minister's concluding remarks. He said:</P>
      <P>The Government wants to see the circumstances necessary for the lifting of the sanctions against Iraq altogether. All this requires is that the Government of Iraq meet its commitments and demonstrate, with concrete evidence, its peaceful intentions, especially with regard to its neighbours.</P>
      <P>My concern is that if Ireland's policy is based on such an expectation, it will be in vain. One of the great enemies of the Iraqi people is the Iraqi regime and any expectation that the regime will change for the good of its people will not be realised. That is the fundamental flaw in the approach adopted by the Minister, although I agree with much of what he said.</P>
      <P>What we must do is to differentiate clearly between measures affecting the people of Iraq and those affecting the regime. The monstrous regime of Saddam Hussein is the greatest enemy of the Iraqi people. There has to be a strategy directed towards finding an international answer to the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people and relieving their suffering. I am sure that the blame for the suffering of the Iraqi people is shared between the UN Security Council and the Iraqi regime. Ireland should have no part in any continuation of the nightmare from which the Iraqi people are suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must at the same time maintain and support the maintenance of as much pressure as possible on the regime of Saddam Hussein to restrict his military capacity and prevent him acquiring weapons of mass destruction. This strat<Col N="392" /> egy must involve the lifting of the general sanctions. The food for oil programme is a disaster. It was introduced as a temporary measure to relieve the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. It has not worked because of the failure and delays at UN level and because of a deliberate strategy on the part of the Iraqi regime. In my view, the Iraqi regime is in the comfortable position that it wants the sanctions to continue. They suit it and this is clear from much of the evidence from the former UN official, Mr. Halliday, and others.</P>
    <P>We must use our position to ensure that the humanitarian nightmare, during which up to one million lives have been lost, is ended. The sanctions continue to cause the loss of children's lives in particular and malnutrition. The death rate is up to 5,000 a month. As a civilised nation, Ireland cannot be associated with that.</P>
    <P>We should be clear that we are prepared to support any reasonable measure to restrict the activities of Saddam Hussein and his regime. In my view, he is equivalent to Hitler. What he did to the Kurds in the north and the Shiahs in the south and what he continues to do to his people is monstrous. It is easy and politically correct to condemn the recent bombing. I am not in favour of bombing and I do not want military action if it can be avoided. All possible measures should be taken first, but I do not have a Pavlovian response in terms of condemning the British and Americans for the bombing. They should be required to justify their actions, but I do not engage, as others have done, in automatic criticism because of the unusual legal and other circumstances that apply. Many more people died in Iraq on the day of the bombing as a result of the actions of Saddam Hussein than the bombing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed by the Minister's speech. Given that he is a courageous man, I thought he would tell the House that he intended to call for the lifting of the sanctions rather than studies about such a move. I hoped he would use his new position on the Security Council to be the voice that stimulated other countries to call for the immediate lifting of the sanctions. It is not enough to say that Ireland is trying to get the climate right so a point can be reached where the lifting of the sanctions can be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an increasing ground swell of support internationally for action from such diverse individuals as Irishman Denis Halliday and Hans Von Sponeck, who were the co-ordinators for humanitarian assistance in Iraq, Mr. Richard Butler and Scott Ritter, who worked with UNSCOM on the inspection of weapons, Kofi Annan, the head of the UN, the representative of the Vatican who visited Iraq and groups such as Caritas Europa, which comprised a cross-party group, and the delegation from this Parliament to Iraq. The universal view is that the sanctions are doing nothing to <Col N="393" /> attack Saddam Hussein, but they are killing the people of Iraq.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 500,000 children have died during the 11 years of sanctions. Between 3,000 and 5,000 infants die each month as a result of the sanctions. The 1999 UNICEF report stated that in marked contrast to the prevailing situation prior to the events of 1991, the infant mortality rates in Iraq today are among the highest in the world. Low infant birth weights affect at least 23% of all births and chronic malnutrition affects every fourth child under the age of five years. Only 41% of the population has regular access to clean water and 83% of all schools need substantial repairs. The ICRC stated that the Iraqi health care system is today in a decrepit state while the UNDP calculates it would take $7 billion to rehabilitate the power sector. These figures relate to a country about which, in 1991, a UN report stated that in the 1980s it was reaching standards of health care that were equivalent to the developed world. That is how far back the country and its people have fallen in the 11 years the sanctions have been in place.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the sanctions were imposed to try to get at Saddam Hussein, but they are not working and it is time to accept that they are contrary to the spirit of the UN Charter. Ireland should take a lead on this matter. It took a lead in relation to other international issues, such as East Timor, and it should do so on this matter. The Caritas report relates the pain people felt when they saw conditions in Iraq. The report states that several tiny babies were crammed together in one incubator and conditions on the wards were cramped, unhygienic and malodorous. The absence of the distinctive hospital smell or disinfectant is noticeable in Iraqi hospitals. Such products do not appear to be available there. Too many babies were sharing old and insanitary incubators and hospital equipment had damaged or missing plastic and Perspex parts.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Keeffe said, the oil for food system is not working and too many projects are on hold. For example, chlorine to ensure clean water is not allowed into Iraq because it might be used for some other purpose. Garbage trucks and water pipes are not allowed into the country in case they fall into the wrong hands. We should wake up to what the sanctions are doing to the people of Iraq. I pay tribute to the people who have been courageous enough to publicly call for the ending of the sanctions. The principle and concept of sanctions must be re-examined. There is no proper administrative structure in place in the UN, such as the mechanism for peacekeeping, that follows the effect of sanctions. They may be a good weapon in some instances, but they have passed their usefulness and they are killing people in Iraq.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he looked forward to hearing the views of Members, but I only have eight minutes in which to contribute and no other Deputy will have an opportunity to speak. It is time to stop dumping debates on foreign affairs and humanitarian issues into ten minute slots on Thursday afternoons. Five questions I wanted answered have been disallowed. This is a scandal and a disgrace. I do not blame the Minister, but I ask him to join us in seeking proper scheduling of foreign affairs discussions in the House so that Members will not be repeatedly and comprehensively insulted. I have made this point to my party's Whip.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's sad speech can be summed up in the sentence that until there is agreement among the five permanent members, nothing will be done. This is a sad and pathetic opening to our time on the Security Council. The French Foreign Minister, Hubert Vedrine, said on the tenth anniversary of the Gulf War that the sanctions were cruel because they punish exclusively the Iraqi people and the weakest among them. He said they are ineffective because they do not touch the regime which is not encouraged to co-operate and they are dangerous because they accentuate the disintegration of a society.</P>
      <P>A pious statement earlier was the hope that, while the sanctions continue, they will affect those against whom they are directed. How often is it necessary to point out the number of children who are dying? I do not want to be accused of being a tool of propaganda for the Iraqi Government &ndash; apparently one can be so accused if one quotes the high figure of 7,500 children dying each month &ndash; but of the 16 agencies involved, the lowest figure quoted is 2,300 a month. I was in Iraq before Christmas and I also visited it ten years ago. There is no doubt that the destruction visited on the country has deeply affected its infrastructure. It would take $7 billion to restore the capacity for clean water there.</P>
      <P>I asked a number of questions that were purported to be answered during the Minister's contribution but they were evaded. I explicitly asked if there was a legal capacity under Resolution 681 for a no-fly zone and bombing. We received a quasi-theological answer which, when it is deconstructed, says there is no legal basis. I do not have time to waste decoding the information, but no international jurist, writing in English, suggests there is a legal capacity under Resolution 681 that justifies a no-fly zone and a bombing campaign. It is a complete distortion of the spirit and letter of Resolution 681.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Resolution 661, we should stop describing the oil for food programme as a humanitarian programme. It was never such a programme. It is Iraqi money, some of which goes <Col N="395" /> to the compensation fund and some to the UN expenses with the rest held in ESCU accounts. When we visited Iraq we saw machine ventilators which required tubes to work but which were not available. We also saw medicines that were out of date and tablet regimes that could not be run for the full course of a child's treatment. There were massive abuses in supply and blockages in relation to the allocation of contracts.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that when everything is right in Iraq things will be put right. That argument has enabled us to hold an equally disgraceful attitude to the Cuban blockade. We hold a joint position with the EU which more or less holds that when the Cubans have changed their society to make it look like America they can be treated as ordinary fair members of the international community. We are doing the same with Iraq.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago I got very little support in this House when I criticised Saddam for his use of mustard gas supplied by West Germany to bomb Kurds. When people refer to what has happened to the Shias are they speaking of the $59 million expended by the US to encourage a revolt following which they were abandoned? I am aware of what happened but do not insult our intelligence by telling us that when everything is right in Iraq we could perhaps stop, in the name of the UN and in our name in this House, participating in the destruction of the lives of children? It is disgraceful to participate in the continuance of sanctions that uniquely impact on civilians.</P>
    <P>Why did we canvass around the world for small nations to look to this alleged former colony on the basis that we would become a member of the UN Security Council and speak with a brave voice? It was said that on this issue, when the five permanent members were in agreement, we would take an initiative. If we wanted to take an initiative where is the advice to the Minister in putting UNMOVIC together again? From our discussions with Tariq Aziz it is clear that there are circumstances in which an observation group would be acceptable in Iraq. The previous observation group left in circumstances which showed some of the activities in which it was engaged.</P>
    <P>There is also a clear record of what was achieved in the observation period. Where is our action in putting together an acceptable framework for the return of an observation group? Would that not be something positive? Would it not be nice to hear that we had obtained an explanation from Britain and the US as to why they oppose the provision of surgical thread, glycerine, parts for cars and vaccines for animals that have been provided to build up the herd? Our actions tip the cap to the two big powers.</P>
    <P>Even on a Thursday afternoon in this House it is good to call for a re-emergence of the autonomy and integrity of our foreign affairs position. What are we free to do? If we were so gutless to <Col N="396" /> never ask the difficult questions why did we wish to advertise our cowardice around the world by asking countries to put us on the UN Security Council, to get representation on sanctions committees, to regularly meet those on the other sanctions committees and to be able to bring home so little? It is an insult to the spiritually minded to call as a prayer the expression of hope that everything will come right in Iraq, that it will suspend its militarisation. We all hope that, as we all hope there will be peace in the world.</P>
    <P>I hope we return to this topic and that we hear something better. I asked the Minister about a BBC2 television programme report of an atomic bomb which had been tested and exploded in 1989 in a named part of the Iraq, apparently without the notice of anybody who lived nearby. I asked him to verify if there was a basis to the report. He replied that in so far as the International Atomic Energy Commission could not visit Iraq it could not know. I am not that stupid. The commission frequently comments on situations that do not require its presence. I asked the Minister if inquiries had been made about the basis of this programme, but he did not answer. He referred to a media report. He should have identified it.</P>
    <P>The sanctions are continuing. The Iraqis are holding a civilian population as hostage for what is directed against an administration. It is in breach of the Geneva Convention and in defiance of the UN Charter, and it is a disgrace for a member of the Security Council to justify what is taking place and to reproduce the empty, dishonest and untrue rhetoric of two members of the council, Britain and the US. I say that not as an enemy of the US. There are millions there who disagree with this militaristic action taken in their name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, and the Minister of State for agreeing to take this important matter. <Col N="397" /> The amalgamation of Scoil Mhuire and Scoil Eoin secondary schools in Athy is of vital importance to this fast growing town and its hinterland, which include Ballylinan, Ballitore and the villages of Kilmeade, Kilkea, Kilberry and Castlemietchell. The town has included in its development plan land rezoning which will permit it to double its population to approximately 12,000 people, a major part of which has already been developed. Kildare County Council and Athy UDC have in recent months erected 100 houses in the area, as has Laois County Council in the catchment area of Ballylinan, an area that has also seen a lot of private development.</P>
      <P>The UDC has also received a number of planning applications in the past month which will see 860 houses erected by private developers in Athy within the next two years. Given these figures, it is imperative that there are no snags or undue hold-ups in relation to the amalgamation of the two schools. The worksheet in relation to this important matter was initiated in May 2000 after a number of errors and it was finalised on 15 December 2000. The revised schedule of accommodation was issued to the two schools on 19 January 2001 and was returned to the Department and acknowledged by it on 6 February 2001.</P>
      <P>There is concern at local level that nothing has happened since. The main concern is that the Department official in charge, Mr. Pat Foxe, has retired. Will the Minister of State explain when the design team will be put in place and when can the boards of management and the school principals meet it? What is the current state of the project and the proposed timescale for completion?</P>
      <P>There is an urgent need for this amalgamation and to develop the site to ensure the proper facilities are in place, including the provision of a gym, extra classrooms, teachers' rooms and principals' rooms. I ask the Minister to ensure that every effort is made to overcome the delays and have this important project for Athy completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Wall for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to respond to this matter. In 1999 my Department was notified of the intention of the trustees to explore the possibility of the amalgamation of these schools. Following consideration of the matter the planning section of the Department agreed in principle to an amalgamation of the two schools pending a technical assessment of the current accommodation of both schools. A joint committee, representative of the partners of both schools, is in place and has started a process working towards eventual amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning section of the Department agreed with the respective boards of management a long-term enrolment figure of 800 pupils for the com<Col N="398" /> bined school. In this regard the two schools named have jointly completed educational worksheets based on a long-term projected enrolment figure of 800 pupils. These worksheets which outline the school's curricular choice have been examined by the inspector who has prepared a schedule of overall accommodation of approximately 6,000 square metres. This schedule was submitted to the school authorities for acceptance and I am pleased to say both schools have recently accepted this schedule.</P>
    <P>The building unit of the Department of Education and Science will arrange for the senior inspector and the technical staff to visit the schools as soon as possible, with a view to preparing a schedule of residual accommodation and a schedule of suggested future use of existing accommodation. The decision as to the location of the amalgamated school will be made in the light of the technical assessments of the buildings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Crawford. I understand fully why the Minister cannot be in the House this evening. His office contacted me earlier today to explain that he was in Belfast earlier and in the affected area.</P>
      <P>The news from County Louth this morning has rightly put this country in a state of national alert. The consequences of a full-scale outbreak of foot and mouth disease throughout the island of Ireland would have a devastating effect on the economy and the new found wealth which has been produced in recent years. Since the outbreak of foot and mouth in the UK just four weeks ago, the effects of this disease in terms of employment have already seen significant numbers of people temporarily out of work. The precautionary measures that were taken over the last few weeks and the curtailments in trade have resulted in many people losing work in some exposed sectors of the economy. We have already seen a significant downturn in tourism, transport, food processing and the catering and leisure industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, the role of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will be absolutely crucial in providing people with financial support in what are very difficult times. The prospect of widespread unemployment as a consequence of the foot and mouth disease must be taken seriously by the Government. Many people who have seen a period of uninterrupted employment may well face into an uncertain future in the weeks ahead. We have a huge responsibility to help everyone who has lost their job as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs must be <Col N="399" /> proactive in reaching out to people who are temporarily out of work. Despite the actions of the Department during the past three weeks, a totally new response is now required to meet the challenge head on. I hope the Minister will review the role played by his Department to date in assisting people who have lost their jobs.</P>
    <P>First, the Minister should join with other ministerial colleagues in co-ordinating on a daily basis the response of his Department to this crisis. I understand that on 12 March the Minister informed local social welfare offices throughout the country to identify the total number of customers laid off as a result of the foot and mouth disease. It would be useful to know the total number of people in this category to date. It would also be useful to provide additional staff in the Department's local offices in parts of the country where there is a high dependence on industries that could be affected by the foot and mouth outbreak.</P>
    <P>Second, the Minister should introduce an aggressive public information campaign, highlighting the exact range of entitlements to which people are entitled if temporarily out of work. The Department should immediately put in place a free phone service to directly inform people who have queries about their entitlements.</P>
    <P>Third, in order for people to obtain unemployment assistance, there is a requirement that they must be &ldquo;genuinely looking for work&rdquo;. There will be a certain group who can find work during this period but for the vast majority of people who are laid off, their local social welfare office would be the first port of call. I expect the Minister to issue instructions to local officers in his Department advising officers to handle such cases with sensitivity and understanding.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the fallout from the foot and mouth crisis will have a devastating effect on low income families where a significant portion of their income derives from part-time earnings or casual work. This group in particular needs to be supported and the current range of entitlements do not allow them to obtain financial support from the Department.</P>
    <P>Tonight thousands of workers are concerned that their jobs might be on the line as a result of this outbreak. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has a responsibility to provide them with assistance and support. The suggestions I have presented to the House are intended to help the Minister and his colleagues in coming to grips with the crisis. We all have a role to play to be constructive at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> My reason for speaking on this issue is the extremely serious position of the whole agricultural sector. Hauliers and those involved in tourism and the meat industry are suffering seriously. I ask the Minister to be sensitive in regard to the farm assist scheme. I understand he has agreed to issue blanket cover to those living in the exclusion area. There are many families outside this zone who have been tied up for a number of weeks as a result of the regulations imposed. These people cannot sell calves, weanlings or breeding stock such as suckling cows or milk cows. The means test which is normally carried out on these farms is based on the number of milk cows, suckler cows and other cattle on which these people depend. This is no longer relevant because these products cannot be sold. The only product these farmers might be able to sell is milk but that alone will not be sufficient to provide them with a livelihood.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider the whole means testing system for farm assist while this crisis is taking place. He should ensure that farm families, including those depending on farms, will at least have something on which to live. Perhaps these people could be helped to provide fodder or other products for their animals. This extremely serious situation should be taken into account and officers should be notified accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Hayes and Crawford for raising this vital issue and for their understanding regarding the absence of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs who is unable to be here because of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in County Louth.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it clear that employees who are laid off as a result of the foot and mouth precautions may qualify for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, subject to satisfying the usual conditions for receipt of those payments. These conditions include being available for and genuinely seeking work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deciding officers of the Department were advised on 12 March to have regard to the temporary nature of lay-offs arising from the foot and mouth precautions when considering whether the conditions for entitlement to unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit are fulfilled. In this regard, they were advised to take into account the fact that the people concerned may not yet have had a chance to consider other employment opportunities that may be available to them. In addition, they were advised that each case should be examined on its own merits. In the circumstances, it is expected that people signing on as a result of the foot and mouth scare would qualify for an unemployment payment subject to satisfying the contribution conditions for unem<Col N="401" /> ployment benefit or the means test for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>People whose self-employment has ceased due to the foot and mouth alert may also qualify for unemployment assistance for the duration of the lay-off. As this payment is subject to a means test, income from all sources is taken into account in the assessment.</P>
    <P>On the question of numbers, a mechanism for identifying claims resulting from the foot and mouth alert has been put in place in the Department since 12 March. Since that date, some 262 such claims have been recorded, of which 236 are currently in payment. In the event that a person does not qualify for an unemployment payment, he or she can apply for supplementary welfare allowance at their local health centre and the community welfare officer will assess them on the basis of their present circumstances and immediate needs.</P>
    <P>It is also open to any farmer adversely affected by the foot and mouth scare to avail of the supports provided under the farm assist scheme or to seek a review of his or her current entitlements under farm assist if applicable. Advertisements highlighting the supports available under the farm assist scheme for farmers affected by the current foot and mouth precautions will appear in today's edition of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> and again in next week's edition due on 29 March. The Department has also been in contact with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development with a view to setting up arrangements to fast-track the investigation process of farm assist claims for farmers affected by the foot and mouth restrictions.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Irish Farmers Association and Teagasc met officials of my Department and the North Eastern Health Board recently about the difficulties faced by farmers within the restricted zone. Following the meeting, the North Eastern Health Board issued a mailshot to farmers within the zone highlighting the availability of farm assist and the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>A number of precautionary measures have been put in place by the Department to ensure that the foot and mouth disease is not unwittingly spread within Ireland. These include the suspension of visits by officers to farms and the processing of claims by members of the farming community by non-personal contact methods.</P>
    <P>The Department is liaising with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on the ongoing developments and is continuing to monitor the situation with a view to putting in place whatever further appropriate measures are needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin will reply to this matter. I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise the matter of the brutal and sinister attack that occurred in Wexford last night.</P>
      <P>Just after 10 p.m. a group of armed thugs broke into the home of Pat Moorehouse and his family in Ferndale Park Estate in Wexford town. Mr. Moorehouse was pinned up against a wall and shot twice in the kneecaps. He is currently in Waterford General Hospital recovering from emergency surgery, while his family tries to come to terms with the horror that was visited upon them by a self-appointed gang of thugs.</P>
      <P>In the short time that has elapsed since this brutal attack, it has been established that Mr. Moorehouse was not the intended victim of the attack. I am reluctant to use the term &ldquo;innocent victim&rdquo; about attacks of this kind, as it seems to imply some degree of legitimacy could be conferred on the attackers if they had struck their intended target. I refuse to countenance any such interpretation, no matter what the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The circumstances of this attack are still unclear. However, our experience tells us that one of two likely scenarios has come to pass. A vigilante gang with paramilitary connections has again taken the law into its own hands or a criminal gang has attempted to settle a score. Either way the action has had tragic consequences for the Moorehouse family and a response from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and from this House is urgently needed.</P>
      <P>Gangland activity is still a major cause for concern in our society. In Dublin, in particular, the rate of gangland attacks is consistently high and clearly demonstrates that the trade in illegal drugs is an ever-present threat. Over recent years we have witnessed the break-up of dangerous and ruthless gangs, however, we have not managed to prevent new thugs taking their place and expanding their criminal network.</P>
      <P>These gangs are becoming increasingly vicious. The so-called canal murders that occurred last year are evidence of the brutality in which drug gangs will engage to protect their empires. The armoury available to these gangs has also become ever more sophisticated and brutal. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must account to this House for the low levels of detection and prosecution in relation to gangland crime, and the new initiatives he now needs to take must be spelled out in response to this debate. I would also be obliged if the Minister of State would comment on the worrying spread of this type of violence outside the Dublin region into the so-called rural areas and the reasons behind that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> The possibility that last night's horrific attack may have been related to vigilante activity must be considered by the Garda and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I wish to comment briefly on the growth of vigilantism, which unfortunately has become an ever-present feature across the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be well aware of the action of Sinn Féin in Kerry in recent months and the arson and physical assaults that occurred in the county in the run up to an electoral contest a short time ago. The pattern of behaviour is being repeated across the country. Last week Sinn Féin in Waterford began promoting what was described by local gardaí as &ldquo;vigilante groups&rdquo;. A local garda superintendent described this in stark terms. He said:</P>
    <P>This is the typical kind of propaganda being used by this organisation throughout the country, but of course, it's with their own agenda in the run up to an election. I think it is appalling that any political organisation would be going down this road.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The ultimate logic of this type of activity has left hundreds of young people in Belfast, Derry and other towns in Northern Ireland maimed for life. It is a reality that resulted in the brutal murder of Mr. Andy Kearney in Belfast in July 1998 in retaliation for the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; of standing up to a local IRA member. It is a twisted form of justice that has no place in a civilised society. That growing trend is now visible in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a strong commitment to the rule of law. He is, no doubt, as concerned as I am at the growing incidence of vigilantism, often encouraged by Sinn Féin. While I have much respect for the developments that have taken place in republicanism in the past decade and its contribution to the peace process, I will not turn a blind eye to unconstitutional, illegal and dangerous vigilantism. I ask the Minister of State to spell out to the House the knowledge she might have of activities of this kind and the steps the Government intends to take to stamp it out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my horror and revulsion and that of the Government at the savage and senseless attack on the person in question. I know that all right-thinking members of the community are appalled and shocked by this attack, particularly as it was carried out in front of this man's family. Our thoughts are with the victim and his family at this very difficult time for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the circumstances of the attack, the Minister was informed by the Garda authorities that at approximately 9.50 p.m. last night, <Col N="404" /> two men, armed with handguns and wearing balaclavas, forcibly entered the victim's home in Ferndale Park Estate in Wexford. One of the men then shot the victim once in each leg. The emergency services and the gardaí were notified by a 999 call and the victim was initially taken by ambulance to Wexford General Hospital and subsequently transferred to Ardkeen General Hospital, where he was operated on in the early hours of this morning. The victim is currently in a comfortable condition in hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister understands that gardaí and forensic experts are carrying out an examination of the crime scene and an incident room has been set up in Wexford Garda station. House to house and other inquiries have commenced in the area. The Minister is satisfied that everything possible is being done by the gardaí to investigate this appalling attack. I am sure I need not point out that violent crimes are given the highest priority by the gardaí and that they are the subject of rigorous Garda investigation. However, I should emphasise that not all the circumstances of this incident are yet known. While there has been media speculation about the motivation behind the incident, I am sure the Deputy will agree that it would be inappropriate for the Minister to comment on or speculate about an ongoing Garda investigation. The Minister can say nothing more about this incident at this early stage.</P>
    <P>Those who take it upon themselves to carry out punishment beatings or shootings have shown themselves to be a menace to law abiding people. The perpetrators of so-called punishment shootings know that their motives are transparent and that all they want to do is to promote their own cynical and selfish ends.</P>
    <P>The Government will not tolerate any attempt to subvert the law and order system or to undermine the work of the gardaí. The Garda is the only agency in the State with the powers and the authority to investigate and tackle crime. So-called punishment shootings are nothing other than blatant gangsterism and whatever short-term and selfish gains the perpetrators hope for, the people of this country will reject this kind of activity wholeheartedly and the Minister knows he can expect nothing less from every Member of this House.</P>
    <P>In relation to claims that there has been an escalation in the use of firearms in violent crimes, the Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied there is no evidence of any major increase in the use of firearms on the street. The use of violence, including murder, by illegal groups is not a new phenomenon. However, all such incidents are given the highest priority by the gardaí and this will continue to be the case. As regards the targeting of particular criminal activity, the Deputy will be aware of the <Col N="405" /> Criminal Justice Act, 1999. This is a flagship measure in the Minister's extensive programme of criminal law reform and further proof of the Government's zero tolerance approach to crime &ndash; an approach which all the available evidence vindicates, not least for the unprecedented reductions in crime levels in recent years. The Minister has asked me to assure the House that he will continue to ensure that adequate legislation is introduced to respond to whatever criminal threats may emerge in the future.</P>
    <P>I can inform the House that while our legislation for tackling organised crime is among the toughest in Europe, the Minister is not content to rest easy with this and that he is always evaluating, in conjunction with the Garda, the best way to deal with crime and will take whatever further steps are necessary to deal with the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue in relation to disturbed children being detained by security firms with the Minister. I would like the Minister to outline the extent and scale of the use of private security firms in units where children are in care and to outline the extent and scale of where these children are being housed by health boards throughout the country with private security apparently providing the staffing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It emerged in the High Court this week that the Department of Health and Children has known since 1999 that vulnerable children in the care of health boards were being placed in units run by a private security company. Mr. Justice Kelly in the High Court said he was astounded by this. This raises more serious questions about the facilities available to health boards and the staffing arrangements in them. Will the Minister outline to the House the scale and extent of the use of private security firms by health boards? How many centres are being run in this manner, if any, and how many children are being cared for by the staff of private security firms? If this is happening &ndash; I do not think it is clear yet whether it is happening and the scale of it &ndash; what qualifications do these staff members have? Has the Garda given them clearance certificates for working with children? How long have these centres been in use? If such centres are operating, the question of whether they are being inspected by either the health boards or the national social services inspectorate arises. If they are not being inspected and if they exist, I am sure the Minister will ask the national <Col N="406" /> social services inspectorate to inspect these places.</P>
    <P>The private security industry is unregulated in this country. I would like the Minister to clarify whether it is Government policy to use private security firms to meet the needs of children who have been in care. This is an area which seems to be shrouded in some mystery. It is not quite clear what is happening so I am simply raising a series of questions in order to give the Minister an opportunity to put the facts on the record. It emerged in the High Court this week that there is some use of security firms and perhaps the Minister will clarify what exactly is happening.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald has raised a very important issue. As the Deputy is aware, the health boards have the statutory responsibility for children in their care. The Child Care Act, 1991, and regulations made under the Act set out the statutory requirements in relation to the placement and care of children in services operated by the health boards themselves and by other service providers acting on behalf of health boards.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the 1991 Act requires each health board to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection. That section also requires health boards to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration and to have regard to the wishes of the child. Under section 4 of the Act, health boards have a duty to take a child into care on a voluntary basis if the child requires care and protection, and is unlikely to receive it unless taken into care, provided the parents or persons acting in<i> loco parentis </i>consent to this arrangement.</P>
      <P>Separate arrangements apply where the parents or persons acting in <i>loco parentis </i>do not voluntarily agree to a child being taken into care under section 4. These can be summarised as follows. Part III of the Act provides for the making of emergency care orders; Part IV of the Act provides for the making of interim care orders, care orders and supervision orders and Part IV also places a duty on a health board to initiate proceedings where a child is considered to require care or protection. Section 24 of the Act restates, in respect of proceedings regarding the care and protection of children, that the welfare of the child shall be regarded as the first and paramount consideration and that regard shall be had to the wishes of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this broad statutory framework, health boards act in the best interests of the child concerned and deal with each individual child on its merits. Where a health board takes a child into care in accordance with the provisions of the 1991 Act, it has two main options in regard to the placement of the child, either foster care or resi<Col N="407" /> dential care. Both types of care are regulated by Part VI of the Act and associated regulations.</P>
    <P>In regard to residential care, a health board can either place a child in a residential home which it operates itself or it can place the child in a children's residential centre, that is, a registered centre which is not operated by a health board. Residential homes are subject to inspection by the social services inspectorate under section 69 of the Act and children's residential centres are subject to inspection by the health board in whose functional area they are located in accordance with article 18 of the Child Care (Standards in Children's Residential Centres) Regulations, 1996. These regulations also incorporate a guide to good practice in children's residential centres.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the matter raised by her is currently the subject of a High Court case <Col N="408" /> in relation to the area health boards in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area and I do not wish to impinge or to prejudice the outcome of the court proceedings. However, the issues raised around this are being actively followed up with the chief executives of all the health boards and the social services inspectorate and I will communicate further with the Deputy with the specific information she has requested.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the sum of money allocated since 1 January 2001 for natural disasters worldwide; the use made of this funding by the countries involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6296/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen): The Government remains deeply concerned about the compounded impact of natural disasters on vulnerable populations across the globe. When natural disasters strike, the consequences are particularly severe in developing countries where they can impede or reverse national development programmes. Already in 2001 we have seen the devastation caused by earthquakes in El Salvador and India. While sudden disasters receive significant media attention, there are many so called forgotten and ongoing disasters which continue to claim many lives.</P>
    <P>Since 1 January this year, the Irish Government has allocated approximately £10 million in emergency humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance. This money will go towards rebuilding the lives of populations affected by disasters both natural and man made. In particular, Ireland has responded quickly and effectively to the earthquakes which occurred in January in El Salvador and India. Both these disasters have directly affected more than 35 million people. The high level of the Government's response so far this year reflects a desire by Ireland Aid to be more pro-active in its response while at the same time enabling more timely emergency interventions in the field. This allows Ireland to preemptively rather than reactively fund those emergencies which might otherwise remain inadequately supported.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government's support to the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Irish non-Governmental organisations, Trócaire, Concern and GOAL in El Salvador will help approximately 10,000 families to recover from the impact of this disaster. This represents a total Ireland Aid response to the earthquakes in El Salvador of £753,000. The vulnerability of Central America to natural disasters, which have caused widespread devastation and misery to the people of the region, is also being taken into account. Ireland Aid is actively exploring how to support emergency preparedness and disaster mitigation activities in the region. For instance, since Hurricane Mitch struck Central America in late 1998 Ireland Aid has provided over IR£1 million per year in rehabilitation assistance including emergency preparedness programmes.</P>
    <P>Following the devastating earthquake which hit <Col N="410" /> Gujarat, India, on 26 January, the Irish Government took early action to support the immediate response and to provide emergency relief for the suffering population. A total of £1,050,000 in humanitarian assistance was granted to the International Federation of the Red Cross, Concern, Trocaire, GOAL, Edith Wilkins Hope Foundation, World Vision and Christian Aid. An independent professional review has been commissioned by Ireland Aid to evaluate the field effectiveness of the earthquake emergency responses it has funded. This will allow the Irish Government an opportunity to build on this experience to enhance our response to future disasters and will inform the ongoing Ireland Aid review.</P>
    <P>It is often the case that the vulnerability of people to natural disasters is exacerbated by conflict and war. In Afghanistan, the population face numerous humanitarian problems including a severe drought, displacement and escalating poverty. A total of £953,000 has been allocated to Afghanistan in 2001 to address basic needs such as food security, health and sanitation with a further £1.07 million to address the ongoing conflict in Angola.</P>
    <P>So far this year, the Irish Government has also responded to the regional drought in the Horn of Africa which has affected the lives of millions in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. These programmes represent expenditure of £750,000. Assistance has also been provided to address natural disasters in Mozambique, Tajikistan and Mongolia in the amount of £755,000.</P>
    <P>The level of expenditure by the Government to natural and other disasters this year is testimony to its ongoing commitment to provide humanitarian assistance to areas of acute need, a commitment which will continue to be fundamental to the Ireland Aid programme as we work to achieve our commitment of 0.7% of GNP by 2007.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's position in relation to the US embargo against Cuba is clear. We are opposed to it, and we wish to see it brought to an early end. We have regularly supported resolutions in the UN General Assembly calling for its lifting, most recently on 9 November last year when the resolution, co-sponsored by Ireland, was carried by 167 votes in favour to three against, with four abstentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union's Common Position on Cuba, to which we subscribe, does not seek to <Col N="411" /> bring about change through coercive measures. Rather, its aim is to promote a dialogue which will encourage a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people.</P>
    <P>EU member states carry on normal bilateral relations across the standard spectrum of contacts from trade to culture, and have actively developed their economic relations with the island to such an extent that the EU is now Cuba's leading foreign investor, principal trade partner, premier source of tourists, and largest provider of development aid and humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>The European Union would very much wish to move to an even closer relationship with Cuba of the kind obtaining with other Latin American countries, and which usually finds expression in the shape of a formal co-operation agreement. However, in order to assess the conditions for the kind of special partnership involved in such a structured co-operation agreement, the EU, as the Common Position states, must evaluate developments in the policies, both internal and external, pursued by Cuba &ldquo;according to the same standards that apply to EU relations with other countries, in particular the ratification and observance of international human rights conventions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, the Cuban Government continues to fail to observe its international obligations in respect of many fundamental human rights. It was for this reason that on 4 December last, following a meticulous examination of the conditions prevailing in Cuba, the EU General Affairs Council was reluctantly obliged once again to renew the terms of the Common Position, pending a change in Cuban policy regarding human rights and freedoms which would enable Havana to accept the standards applied by the EU to all countries &ndash; without any discrimination &ndash; wishing to have the kind of enhanced relationship with the Union implied by an institutionalised co-operation agreement.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, in the meantime, as the Council decision of 4 December last makes clear, &ldquo;it is essential that the EU should deploy further efforts to engage the Cuban authorities in a constructive and frank dialogue on a variety of issues of common interest that may actually produce tangible results, particularly in the political, economic and civil rights spheres. Confidence-building measures should thus continue to be implemented in the spirit of the Common Position, which will be maintained as the basis of EU-Cuban relations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government will work to ensure that the European Union maintains its efforts to try to develop a new basis for a better relationship with Cuba, which might lead in time to a fully fledged partnership.</P>
    <P>In this connection, I welcome the presentation <Col N="412" /> of credentials to President McAleese last week of the first Cuban ambassador to Ireland in reciprocation of the accreditation last year of Ireland's first ambassador to Cuba.</P>

      <P>The Good Friday Agreement provided that consideration be given to the establishment of an independent consultative forum appointed by the two administrations, North and South. In addition, in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness the Government gave a commitment to work towards the early establishment and effective functioning of the forum. The Deputy will appreciate that the process of consideration of the establishment of a North-South forum must naturally take place in partnership with the Northern Ireland Executive.</P>
      <P>At the last plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, in Dublin on 26 September, the Council agreed that a joint North-South working group, comprising officials of both administrations, be tasked with studying the establishment of the forum and reporting to the next plenary.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, due to difficulties in the wider political context, it was regrettably not possible to proceed with the planned NSMC plenary on 2 March. However, as result of the discussions at Hillsborough on 8 March, the two Governments are hopeful that sufficient progress can be made in the period ahead to, among other things, facilitate an early convening of the NSMC in plenary format. Meanwhile, the joint working group continues to make good progress with its study and plans to report to the plenary meeting of the NSMC when convened.</P>

      <P>Following on from Ireland joining Partnership for Peace, PfP, in December 1999, the Individual Partnership Programme for Ireland's participation was recently agreed.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, each State participating in Partnership for Peace develops an individual partnership programme tailored to that State's interests and priorities on the basis of its PfP presentation document. Ireland's programme gives particular emphasis to co-operation in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, reflecting the priorities set out in Ireland's presentation document, which was approved by this House in November 1999.</P>
      <P>Ireland's policy approach in this area will be developed in the light of initial experience. The programme has been drawn up in a flexible form to allow for some adjustment in any subsequent iteration, having regard at all times to the overall approach set out in the presentation document. Ireland's first individual partnership programme will run until 31 December 2001 when it will be updated.</P>
      <P>The individual partnership programme has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and details of the specific activities involved have been supplied to the library. The text of the individual partnership programme is also available on my Department's website, as well as on the website of the Department of Defence.</P>

      <P>The Government has been advised by the Attorney General that an amendment to the Constitution is required before the State may ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. At a meeting held on 22 January last, the Government agreed that preparations should be put in train in respect of the referendum to be held in relation to the International Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>I arranged for the drafting of a Bill to amend the Constitution last year. The drafting of this Bill has recently been completed by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it is intended to seek approval for the text of the Bill at the Government's meeting on 27 March. Subject to Government approval, it will be presented to the Dáil shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>In connection with the actual ratification process itself, apart from the need to amend the Constitution and therefore the need for a referendum approving such an amendment, implementing legislation will be required in order for Ireland to be in a position to meet its obligations under this very complex statute. This legislation falls within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Only when such legislative measures are in place may the State ratify the statute.</P>

I am of course in full agreement with the statements made earlier today by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>In light of this most unwelcome development, I have today issued to all our diplomatic missions revised instructions to update them on the situation here and, in particular, on the Government's intention to put in place immediately stringent new operational measures to contain the outbreak.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I am acutely aware of my Department's role in ensuring that other countries are kept fully aware of the factual position on the foot-and-mouth situation with respect to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Upon notification of the outbreak of the disease in Britain on 20 February, immediate steps were taken by my Department to ensure that Irish diplomatic missions abroad had at their dis<Col N="415" /> posal the most up-to-date information on the disease and, in particular, on the rigorous control measures put in place by the Government.</P>
    <P>Since the outbreak in Britain, our diplomatic missions have been closely monitoring developments in Ireland's overseas markets for food products. This work is being carried out in the closest co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Bord Bia and is aimed at protecting the high reputation for safety and quality which Irish food products have achieved in the international marketplace.</P>
    <P>We will know shortly the restrictions affecting Irish food exports that are to be introduced at EU level and will then be in a position to evaluate their likely impact. The effects of today's development on our food exports will of course be kept under constant review by all relevant Departments and State agencies, including my own Department.</P>
    <P>There can be no question about the Government's firm determination to contain this outbreak. In this endeavour, the Government, I know, can count on the full support of all sides of this House and the backing of all sections of Irish society. I can assure the House that, and under my direction, the Department of Foreign Affairs will keep our diplomatic missions fully informed of developments in Ireland. Our missions will remain vigilant in their efforts to ensure that Ireland's position on this issue is at all times clearly understood abroad and will work, within the limits of what is possible, to maintain market access for Irish food exports.</P>

      <P>With regard to the observance of human rights in China, the Government remains very concerned about the situation in a number of areas. We have repeatedly expressed our concerns to the Chinese authorities, both bilaterally and through the EU-China human rights dialogue.</P>
      <P>This dialogue is our preferred channel for working to improve the human rights situation. At the General Affairs Council of 22-23 January, the EU took a number of decisions to improve the dialogue. It was decided to intensify it, focus it better and assess it on a continuous basis. A number of specific areas were highlighted for priority attention by the EU, including reform of administrative detention, respect for the fundamental rights of all prisoners, untrammelled exercise of freedom of religion and belief both public and private, respect for the right to organise, and respect for cultural rights and religious freedoms. The most recent session of the EU-China human rights dialogue took place on 22-23 February.</P>
      <P>On 28 February, the Chinese authorities announced their decision to ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ICESCR. Together with my European partners, I welcomed this decision and view it as an important starting point for further improvements in the situation of economic, social and cultural rights in China.</P>

      <P>Matters relating to the welfare of Irish emigrants in Britain are discussed as necessary from time to <Col N="417" /> time by representatives of the Irish and British Governments at different levels. No such matter has had to be broached by me in my contacts with British Government interlocutors since becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government since 1984 has been giving financial support through the Díon Committee based at the embassy in London to voluntary organisations in Britain which advise and assist Irish emigrants there. A sum of two million and fifteen thousand pounds is being made available for grants this year as compared with one million and fifteen thousand pounds last year and £765,000 in 1999. The Interdepartmental Committee on Emigration, chaired by my Department, is considering how best the particular health and social problems of many Irish emigrants in Britain may be addressed. I am advised that further research into the causes of these health and social problems &ndash; perhaps in the context of similar comparative studies in other EU countries as part of an action programme on social exclusion being prepared by the European Commission to be launched later this year &ndash; will facilitate and underpin decisions on measures by either Government to address them.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government is committed, in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, to establishing a task force to develop a coherent long-term approach to our emigrants and their needs and I intend to put specific proposals in this regard to my colleagues in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>The Government's commitment to demonstrating its respect for the different traditions in the island of Ireland is an important aspect of the Good Friday Agreement and we continue to work actively to fulfil it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In support of its efforts in this area, in April 1999 the Government increased the funding available to groups working to achieve peace and mutual understanding between the different traditions on the island of Ireland to £2 million per annum, an eight-fold increase. The moneys are disbursed through the Reconciliation Fund, operated by my Department. This increase enabled us to provide grants worth £4 million to 137 organisations involved in a wide range of cross<Col N="418" /> community, educational, research and outreach activities in 1999 and 2000.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, my predecessor, Deputy Andrews, established an interdepartmental committee on the development of the Battle of the Boyne site on 8 January, 1998. The committee is making good progress on this historic project which has unique symbolic significance for the Unionist tradition in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The report of the Peace and Reconciliation Platform points to the need for continued engagement with the task of building understanding, respect and trust between the different traditions on this island. As such, the Government will continue to examine the potential for further measures to strengthen relationships between these traditions and to promote an inclusive understanding of the rich cultural heritage of the island as a whole. The publication of the report represents a further contribution to the debate on reconciliation on this island.</P>

      <P>The Government considers that the human rights situation in most parts of Nigeria has improved since President Obasanjo came to power in May 1999. However, the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in a number of states in northern Nigeria in the course of the year 2000 has exacerbated ethnic and religious tensions there.</P>
      <P>Following the recent flogging of a 17-year-old girl, Bariya Magazu, in Zamfara state, the European Union issued a statement condemning the flogging as a violation of international human rights, in particular the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to which Nigeria is a signatory, Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which state that &ldquo;no one shall be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&rdquo;. The statement welcomes the federal government's efforts to ascertain that Nigerian law is in compliance with international human rights covenants.</P>
      <P>Together with our EU partners and other members of the international community, the Government will continue to encourage the elected authorities to strengthen further the protection of human rights in Nigeria, including the rights of women.</P>

Our discussions covered bilateral relations between Ireland and France, which we agreed were excellent, and issues of mutual concern on the European and international agenda, with a particular focus on matters before the United Nations Security Council. In particular, we discussed the current UN Security Council handling of Iraq, including sanctions; the western Balkans; the African crises, including the Democratic Republic of Congo and the situation in the Great Lakes; and East Timor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has been gravely concerned at the upsurge in sectarian attacks in Northern Ireland in recent months. These attacks have taken place in a number of areas including north Belfast, Coleraine, Ballymoney and Larne. Since 1 November last, there have been over 60 pipe-bomb attacks, as well as gun-attacks, threats and other acts of intimidation. While such attacks have been carried out on both communities, the vast majority have been directed against members of the Nationalist community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I condemn all such sectarian attacks, whether on Catholics or Protestants, in the strongest possible terms. They are despicable acts designed at the very least to frighten and to intimidate people out of their homes. The Good Friday Agreement recognised the right to freely choose one's place of residence and the right to freedom from sectarian harassment. It is imperative that these <Col N="421" /> rights be effectively vindicated for everyone in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I expressed the Government's concerns about these attacks when I met the then Secretary of State on 5 December last. I also discussed the matter with Secretary of State Reid when we met in Dublin on 22 February. In these discussions, I stressed the importance of devoting the necessary resources to combat sectarian crime. We also discussed the need for practical measures to be taken to provide basic security to people targeted in such attacks. In response, the British Government is currently examining a number of measures aimed at protecting vulnerable households.</P>
    <P>We have been informed by the British authorities that additional security measures have been put in place by the police to combat sectarian attacks over the past two months. There has been a notable increase in police patrolling in the worst affected areas, with the British army deployed where necessary, in support of the police. There have also been some police successes in terms of arrests and seizures of material in a number of pipe-bomb factories. I welcome these efforts and the noticeable falling-off in the number of attacks in recent weeks. It is important that these efforts be continued over the coming months. The Government will continue to monitor this situation closely.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Taoiseach met with members of the Hamill family on 8 June 2000 and afterwards, stated that the case was of urgent public interest and that the issues of concern involved must be resolved in a manner which would command the confidence of the community through an independent, judicial public inquiry.</P>
      <P>On 24 November 2000, the Police Ombudsman took over direct and active supervision of the police disciplinary investigation.

      <P>Under the so-called &ldquo;Copenhagen criteria&rdquo;, membership of the EU requires that a candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities.</P>
      <P>On the question of crime, as with existing member states of the EU, different candidate states have differing specific problems. Clearly the very rapid transformation of societies in Central and Eastern Europe has brought about its own special difficulties. However, the EU and the candidate states are already co-operating in the fight against serious crime. A pre-accession pact on organised crime with the candidate states of Central and Eastern Europe and Cyprus has been agreed and this is implemented, <i>inter alia</i>, through a special group of experts. EU assistance is also provided in this area through the PHARE programme.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are Council of Europe anti-crime programmes, in which candidate countries are involved. One of these programmes was organised during 1999 and 2000 in conjunction with the EU Commission. Its objective was to strengthen capacities, policies and co-operation in relation to organised crime, in particular in the context of helping the candidate countries to adopt and implement effectively the acquis of the EU and to adopt the relevant instruments of the Council of Europe. Ireland was closely involved in this programme.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 2.</P>
      <P>From the outset of the epidemic, we have recognised that HIV-AIDS is now the major development challenge facing Africa. The scale of the epidemic is unprecedented with up to 30 million people infected in Sub-Saharan Africa. In South Africa, UNAIDS estimates that up to 20% of the adult population are infected.</P>
      <P>Against that background, I think it is regrettable that international drugs companies have decided to use the courts to try to block the efforts of the South African Government to provide cheaper drugs. As I outlined in my previous reply, I would certainly support calls for this action to be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The German development Minister has appealed for the pharmaceutical companies to withdraw their case against the South African Government. She called for &ldquo;co-operation, not confrontation&rdquo;. I echo that call, and hope the adjournment of the court case would allow an opportunity for the drugs companies to renew their dialogue with the South African Government to find agreement on the best way to provide drugs at an affordable price.</P>

      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan. We are particularly concerned about the tremendous suffering the conflict has inflicted on the Afghan people. The conflict, which has been going on in various forms since 1979, has resulted in innumerable deaths and casualties, as well as the displacement of millions of people and the ruin of the social and economic fabric of the country.</P>
      <P>Through the United Nations, and together with our EU partners, we will continue to make every effort to promote dialogue between the parties in Afghanistan with a view to restoring peace to the country. As an important objective in this, we would insist that human rights and internationally accepted norms are respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concerns of the EU about the continuing grave violations of human rights in Afghanistan, including the rights of women, will be made known at the forthcoming 57th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. These concerns are again being expressed at the current session <Col N="426" /> of the UN General Assembly in New York, with the full support of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Ireland and our EU partners have repeatedly called on the Taliban and other Afghan factions to respect basic human rights and to prevent gender discrimination. The Union's common position on Afghanistan was adopted earlier this year and urges all Afghan factions to end discriminatory policies and to protect and promote the equal rights and dignity of men and women. The European Parliament has also recently expressed its concerns about developments in Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>The people of Afghanistan face a bleak future. Drought, crop failure, conflict, displacement, lack of access to health services and clean water have devastated the lives of millions of Afghans. Ireland and our EU partners have agreed to support aid programmes in Afghanistan aimed at improving the humanitarian situation. On 18 March, Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, announced a package of assistance totalling £953,000 which will address drought assistance, food security, health and sanitation. Concern and Christian Aid Ireland are providing emergency assistance to the most vulnerable among those affected by drought in Ghor province and Herat. The UN agencies the World Food Programme, WFP, UNICEF and the Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO, are carrying out emergency activities throughout Afghanistan in the sectors of food, health, nutrition, water and sanitation. Clearly, however, their full effectiveness can only be realised in conditions of some peace and stability.</P>
    <P>The terrible humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is our priority concern. However, Ireland, in conjunction with the EU and the UN, has also strongly condemned the destruction of statues and non-Islamic shrines by the Taliban authorities. We consider this act of cultural barbarism and religious intolerance to be a crime against the world's common heritage which will irreparably and irreversibly deprive Afghanistan of its unique historical and cultural patrimony. The EU has protested to the Taliban authorities and has requested a meeting with the Taliban leader Mullah Omar in this connection. Moreover, it is incumbent on the Taliban leadership to prioritise the rebuilding of the country, the renewal of the fabric of society, and the relief of the immense suffering and deprivation of the people of Afghanistan.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that we will continue to make every effort to improve the situation in Afghanistan. Bilateral level agreements are in force, or under active negotiation, between Ireland and many of the candidate countries.</P>
    <P>Membership of the EU by the candidate states of central and eastern Europe will help us all achieve more in the continuing battle against organised crime.

      <P>The situation in southern Serbia, and in the neighbouring Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, continues to be of grave concern. In both cases, there is strong evidence that recent violent incidents have been perpetrated by extremists operating mainly from bases within the 5km deep ground safety zone which separates Kosovo from Serbia proper.</P>
      <P>In southern Serbia itself, the situation has eased somewhat since the ceasefire brokered by NATO on 12 March between the UCPMB &ndash; Liberation Army of Presevo, Medveda and Bujanovac &ndash; and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities in Belgrade. The signatories committed themselves to enter into direct dialogue within one week. The same day, NATO and FRY signed an agreement to begin implementation of the NATO decision to introduce a phased and conditioned reduction of the ground safety zone.</P>
      <P>The European Union monitoring mission has made a positive contribution to restoring peace and stability in southern Serbia through substantially increasing the presence of monitors in the region. The EU is actively reviewing what further assistance it can provide towards the restoration of normal conditions there.</P>
      <P>The main focus of concern is now FYROM, where ethnic Albanian extremists have dug in to the west of Tetovo. The Macedonian armed forces have threatened to use all means at their disposal to dislodge them if they do not withdraw. Ireland, as a member state of the European Union, fully supports the call made by the EU this week for a cessation of violence by extremists and the encouragement of the democratically elected Government of FYROM to continue to pursue domestic reforms, in particular the improvement of inter-ethnic relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the United Nations Security Council, Ireland is supporting a draft resolution on FYROM, introduced at the initiative of the UK, which welcomes the steps taken by the Government there to build a multi-ethnic society within its borders. The resolution welcomes the contribution by the European Union monitoring mission and other international organisations to a <Col N="429" /> peaceful solution in southern Serbia and the wider region and supports the Governments of FYROM and FRY in their efforts to end the violence in a manner consistent with the rule of law. It underlines the need for all differences to be resolved by dialogue among all legitimate parties.</P>
    <P>The European Council in Stockholm this weekend will be reviewing the latest developments in the region and will have an opportunity to exchange views with the President and Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation.</P>

      <P>Ireland's priorities for the Stockholm European Council should be seen against the framework of advancing the Lisbon agenda. Ireland remains fully committed to implementing the full range of strategies and measures agreed at Lisbon last March which are aimed at transforming the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the Stockholm summit, the Taoiseach wrote to the Swedish Prime Minister, Goran Persson, in January indicating the following the priorities for Ireland: underpinning current strong economic trends and progress towards Lisbon employment targets including by the pursuit of economic growth that advances sustainable development; mainstreaming the social inclusion agenda; developing lifelong learning including basic skills, education and training opportunities; responding to the challenges of a changing demographic profile including the promotion of equal opportunities, gender equality and the sustainability of public finances; ensuring a sharper focus on the regulatory reform agenda; further development of the European Area of Research and Development; and implementing of the e-Europe action plan and financial services action plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our approach to the Stockholm European Council, and in accordance with the priorities outlined in the Taoiseach's letter, Ireland has placed particular emphasis on the issue of developing lifelong learning including basic skills, education and training opportunities. To this end, Ireland took part in a working group, which also included the UK, Portugal and Denmark, which produced a report entitled From Lisbon to Stockholm, Basic Skills for Employability and Citizenship. This report highlights the critical importance of a specific focus on the development of basic <Col N="431" /> skills both for those in the workplace and for those seeking to enter or re-enter the labour market</P>
    <P>In a further contribution to the Stockholm summit, a national paper on the regulatory system entitled Better Regulation Through Partnership was forwarded by the Taoiseach to Prime Minister Persson on 6 March. The paper draws attention to the fact that over-regulation and under-regulation can impede achievement of the Lisbon goals and that poor quality or excessive regulation will inevitably inhibit economic growth and social progress. It indicates that Ireland wishes to see proposals brought forward by the Commission for promoting greater dialogue between national competition authorities as to how competition policy principles could be used to support regulatory coherence in the EU and in member states. The key themes in the document are benchmarking regulatory reform &ndash; it is proposed in the paper that the European Commission and member states should undergo a regulatory reform review based on the OECD process and the establishment of a benchmarking framework and a virtual management network are also suggested; consultation on regulation &ndash; it is proposed that social partnership mechanisms could be adapted to form part of new consultation mechanisms at the European level; and the social partners could be invited to participate in a consideration of possible models; and impact of regulation &ndash; it is proposed that a common regulatory impact assessment model should be introduced and piloted and training mechanisms for RIA should be developed.</P>
    <P>It is also suggested in the paper that there should be more coherence and dialogue between EU member states in the area of competition policy and enforcement.</P>

      <P>Ireland has supported the Everything but Arms initiative from the outset. The initiative, which provides for enhanced market access for the world's 48 poorest countries &ndash; those classified by the United Nations as least developed countries &ndash; was agreed by EU Ministers at the General Affairs Council in Brussels on 26 February. Under the proposal imports from the LDCs will gain duty and quota free admission to the Community market. In three sensitive commodity sectors &ndash; rice, sugar and bananas &ndash; the liberalisation will be progressive. Full liberalisation for imports of LDC bananas will be achieved in 2006. <Col N="432" /> Full liberalisation for imports of rice and sugar will begin immediately and will take place in stages up to complete liberalisation in 2009.</P>
      <P>Last November, the EU Council of Ministers adopted an overall policy statement on development which states that the principal aim of EU development policy is poverty reduction. The statement identifies the integration of developing countries, particularly least developed countries, into the world economy as a necessary condition for their growth and sustainable development. Currently, the LDCs account for only 0.4% of world trade. The decision by EU Ministers is an important step in helping the LDCs to improve their trading opportunities significantly. Poor economies need better market access for the goods they are efficient at producing if they are to achieve long-term development.</P>
      <P>The Everything but Arms initiative also represents a significant improvement on the undertaking on LDC market access given in the new ACP-EC Partnership Agreement on Trade and Development, which was signed at Cotonou in Benin in June of last year. Under the terms of the agreement 77 African, Caribbean and Pacific States, including the LDCs, will also benefit from 13.8 billion euros of EU assistance in the five years to 2005 to help them to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development.</P>
      <P>A key element of the implementation of the initiative will be helping the LDCs to develop their capacities to take advantage of the new trading opportunities offered by the agreement. The Cotonou agreement provides for EU development assistance to be used both to strengthen capacity in productive areas, and to improve trade development, including the promotion of fair trade. At EU level, we will continue to press for the swift and efficient delivery of EU development assistance to support these activities. We are also looking at ways that the Ireland Aid programme could support trade capacity building in developing countries. We will continue to work with the LDC countries to help them take full advantage of the new trade opportunities which the Everything but Arms initiative offers.</P>

In raising our concerns with the Indonesian authorities we have made known our readiness to support their efforts to address the many problems requiring action and reform in Indonesia, including <Col N="433" /> addressing the situation in Irian Jaya, by moving towards greater decentralisation and autonomy without affecting Indonesia's territorial integrity.</P>
      <P>We believe that such moves should take place on the basis of dialogue and negotiations, free from violence, between the Indonesian authorities and representatives of the local population. Any actions from either side which could hinder or make the prospect of dialogue more difficult must be a cause of concern.

In addition, it is estimated that approximately £8.35 million was disbursed to NGOs via APSO and NCDE, both organisations are directly funded by Ireland Aid. Therefore, in 2000, £27.35 million was allocated to NGOs which represents almost 20% of the funds under direct Ireland Aid control for expenditure purposes. A number of Irish NGOs also receive considerable funding from multilateral agencies such as the UN and the EU to which the Irish Government contributes from its overseas development assistance budget.</P>
      <P>All applications for funding from NGOs, including missionary orders, must conform to a detailed set of criteria and guidelines pertaining to the particular sector being funded. Applicants for funding must demonstrate a capacity to carry out the tasks envisaged as well as a clear and coherent strategy to achieve the aims and objectives of the programme or project. The track record of the applicants in terms of planning, management, monitoring and evaluation is also an important consideration when examining proposed projects and programmes. Applications must be carefully costed in advance. Successful applicants are subject to formal contractual arrangements which set out the terms, conditions and reporting requirements. A full list of all NGO project funding is available in the Ireland Aid annual reports in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2001 it is intended to carry out a review of four of the NGO block grant recipients. These reviews are already under way. A review of NGO emergency operations in the earthquake zone in <Col N="434" /> India will take place in April. A number of other reviews and monitoring visits are in the planning stages.</P>
    <P>My Department has a separate audit and evaluation unit tasked with ensuring the highest standards of evaluation and the adoption of best development practice. Independent consultants and international experts are regularly commissioned to assist in the evaluation process. Each year a number of projects and programmes carried out by NGOs are selected for rigorous evaluation and financial audit by Ireland Aid's evaluation and audit unit. NGOs in receipt of public funds must demonstrate that they have a system in place to monitor and evaluate projects and a demonstrated capacity to address issues such as sustainability, participation, local ownership, gender, environmental impact and cost effectiveness. In addition, the evaluation team reports on whether the projects and programmes are performing to expectations, whether the funds are reaching the beneficiaries and whether the projects and programmes funded represent good value for money. In Ireland Aid, evaluation is perceived as a vital tool in learning important development lessons and adopting new and improved ways of bringing about sustainable change in the lives of the poor in the developing world. We must strive to ensure aid is delivered as productively, effectively and efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government's programme of development co-operation is also subject to rigorous peer review by the development assistance committee of the OECD. In 1999 the OECD published its review of the Irish programme. The OECD review was very positive and stated that Ireland sets very high standards for aid and that there was a clear focus on poverty reduction.</P>
    <P>This is a historic time in the context of Ireland's programme of development co-operation. The Taoiseach at the millennium summit gave a commitment to reaching the internationally recognised target of 0.7% of GNP for development assistance. This presents us with the challenge of maintaining the quality of our programmes in a time of unprecedented growth. In this context I hope to see increased funding channelled through NGOs and especially those with proven track records of achievement and effective management. It is essential that we work with partner NGOs in giving increased focus to outcomes and impact. Increased funding through NGOs, or any other channel for that matter, does not automatically mean enhanced quality and effective aid disbursement. The maintenance of quality aid delivery is a shared objective with NGOs and regular evaluation is an essential tool in this endeavour.</P>
    <P>The review of Ireland Aid, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, is currently under way and will be examining all aspects of the aid programme, including working with NGOs. The review committee has advertised in the national press requesting submissions to its deliberations from interested parties and stake<Col N="435" /> holders. I hope there will be a wide response in order that the aid review committee may examine as wide a range of submissions as possible. The committee will also consult with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <P>The Government had detailed discussions with the British Government and the parties on the Policing (Northern Ireland) Bill as it progressed through its various parliamentary stages. In the course of the legislative process, substantial improvements were made to the Bill which passed into law on 23 November last. However, the parties continued to have concerns about aspects of the new Police Act, 2000, and the draft revised implementation plan.</P>
      <P>In the intervening months, the Government has worked closely and constructively with the British Government and the parties to resolve the outstanding issues in relation to policing. Policing was also among a range of issues discussed at the meeting between the parties and the two Governments at Hillsborough on 8 March last.</P>
      <P>As a result of these discussions, significant progress has been made. However, concerns that the British legislation and plans for implementation do not fully reflect the letter and spirit of the Patten report remain. These concerns need to be satisfactorily addressed if a police service acceptable to all sides of the community in Northern Ireland is to be established, and if young people from all sides of the community are to feel able to join the new police service of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>We have made considerable headway, but more remains to be done. The Governments and parties will continue to address all the outstanding issues with a view to reaching agreement in June.</P>

      <P>The systematic and ongoing violation of human rights in Burma &ndash; Myanmar &ndash; is a matter of great concern to the Government. These concerns are fully shared by our EU partners. The continuing refusal of the military regime to address the find<Col N="436" /> ings of various UN and other inquiries is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The International Labour Organisation has been carrying out a detailed examination of the practice of forced labour in Burma since 1998. It has given the military regime every opportunity to abandon this practice. In the absence of a positive response, the ILO adopted an unprecedented resolution in June 2000 calling on Burma to &ldquo;take concrete action&rdquo; to implement the recommendations of a 1998 commission of inquiry which found that resort to forced labour in the country was &ldquo;widespread and systematic&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the June resolution, the Burmese authorities were given until 30 November to implement the recommendations of the commission of inquiry. Following an assessment by an ILO technical co-operation mission, the ILO deemed, in November 2000, that the relevant recommendations had not been implemented by the Burmese authorities. As a result, a series of measures were adopted and communicated to all ILO members, including all EU member states, as well as to employer and worker representatives in member countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully supports the measures taken by the ILO aimed at eliminating the incidence of forced labour in Myanmar. Ireland, in consultation with our EU partners, has examined these measures with a view to ensuring that they are implemented to the optimum effect. In this connection, the Government informed the ILO director-general of the Government's support, and the support of employers and trade union representatives in Ireland, for the ILO's position in relation to Burma. Irish companies with trade/investment links with Burma will now be informed of the Government's support for the measures taken by the ILO.</P>
      <P>The practice of forced labour is only one of many human rights violations in Burma. It is envisaged that these violations, as well as other areas of concern, will be addressed in a full and comprehensive resolution at 57th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's total opposition to the use of the death penalty and the efforts we have made, in conjunction with our EU partners and in accordance with the common EU guidelines on the issue of the death penalty, to seek its universal abolition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> The case in Missouri referred to is of particular concern since the person on death row is reported to have a mental disorder and was under the age of 18 when the crime was committed. His execution would be contrary to the UN Economic and Social Council safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, as well as Resolution 2000/65 adopted at last year's session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which specifically urges all states that still maintain the death penalty &ldquo;not to impose the death penalty on a person suffering from any form of mental disorder or to execute any such person&rdquo;. We have therefore supported a Swedish Presidency proposal to make a demarche at State level appealing that the sentence of the person referred to in Missouri be commuted to life imprisonment, or such other penalty as is compatible with international law.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue its efforts to seek the universal abolition of the death penalty. At the 57th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights which commenced this week we will work to ensure maximum support for the EU-sponsored resolution on the death penalty.</P>

      <P>The figures quoted by the Deputy testify to the unacceptable gulf between spending on armaments and spending on the prevention of communicable diseases which are killing millions of people in poor countries. Ireland has always taken a strong position at the UN in favour of disarmament and against excessive military expenditure. We have been at the forefront of efforts to reinvigorate efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament through our New Agenda initiative at the UN. We have also played a leading role in such important international initiatives as the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel landmines and the EU code of conduct on arms exports. We are playing an active role in the preparations for the forthcoming UN Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The international fight against HIV-AIDS, malaria and TB is now attracting significant international attention. The G8 &ndash; USA, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia &ndash; at its meeting in Okinawa in July 2000 discussed international health issues for the first time. It committed itself to deliver three critical UN targets; to reduce the number of HIV-AIDS infected young people by 25% by 2010; to reduce TB deaths and prevalence of the disease <Col N="438" /> by 50% by 2010; and to reduce the burden of disease associated with malaria by 50% by 2010.</P>
    <P>Together with key UN agencies, the G8 is developing strategies to meet these targets. The EU has recently issued a new detailed policy called accelerated action governing the fight against HIV-AIDS, malaria and TB. Ireland played an active role in the development of this policy, including through a letter from the Taoiseach to the Commission President, interventions by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, at the Development Council and in discussions with the Commission services.</P>
    <P>The UN will devote a special session of the General Assembly to the issue of HIV-AIDS in June 2001. Ireland is contributing to the preparatory process. We are stressing the importance of the long-term development of sustainable health systems, the need to ensure the plethora of international initiatives against communicable diseases are co-ordinated and are complementary to existing efforts in the field and the need for political leadership in the implementation of national prevention strategies.</P>
    <P>At a recent debate on the issue of HIV-AIDS in the Security Council Ireland also raised the issue of access to medicines and mentioned the need for clarity on such difficult legal issues as tiered pricing, compulsory licensing, parallel importing and patent protection.</P>
    <P>Ireland Aid has integrated the fight against HIV-AIDS into all of its development activities. We have also sharply increased our funding to UNAIDS and WHO and are contributing to the international aids vaccine initiative. We are also contributing to Stop TB and are considering a proposal for an allocation to the European Malaria Vaccine Initiative.</P>
    <P>The spread of these three communicable diseases is rooted in poverty and is facilitated by the lack of adequate healthcare systems in the poor countries which are most affected. The over-arching objective of Ireland Aid is poverty eradication. In all of our interactions with the EU development programme, with UN agencies and in UN global conferences on development issues we consistently seek to focus discussion and action on the need to help the governments of the poorest countries take control of their development agenda and to implement programmes with the objective of poverty eradication.</P>
    <P>The diversion of even a small portion of current military expenditure to development assistance would greatly assist our partners in development in making measurable progress in their efforts to reduce poverty and in the fight against communicable diseases.</P>

      <P>I have not yet had the opportunity to meet Mr Peres, who recently took up office as Foreign Minister of Israel, but I hope to be able to do so before long. In view of Ireland's current membership of the United Nations Security Council, it is important to develop and maintain close contact with my counterparts in the Middle East region.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the crisis in the Middle East which has cost the lives of over 400 Palestinians and more than 40 Israelis in recent months. We have made our concern clear to both sides, at ministerial and official level. We deplore all acts of violence and call again on both sides to demonstrate the utmost restraint and to do more to avoid further bloodshed. In particular, we have called on Israel to lift the economic blockade of Palestinian communities which is causing acute hardship and weakening the Palestinian Authority, the key Palestinian interlocutor in the peace process.</P>
      <P>From recent discussions with my French, German, Russian and US counterparts, I believe the European Union should consider how it can become more effectively engaged in working for a comprehensive resolution of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. I am currently examining with my EU colleagues the possibilities in this regard, and will be discussing the issues involved at the European Council in Stockholm later this week.</P>
      <P>I had discussions yesterday with Dr. Nabil Shaath, Palestinian Minister for Planning and International Co-operation. He briefed me on the latest situation in Palestine and developments since Prime Minister Sharon took office in Israel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He gave me a detailed picture of the effect of Israeli closure policy on the Palestinian economy as well as the continued settlement-building. These activities make a return to a peaceful situation all the more difficult to bring about.

    <P>The crisis in the Middle East has been the focus this week of debate in the Security Council. Ireland has made clear its concern about the urgent need to end the tragic conflict between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples that has disfigured the entire region for too long.</P>

      <P>Article 27.3(b) of the WTO TRIPS agreement allows members to exclude from patentability plants and animals other than micro-organisms, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals other than non-biological and microbiological processes. However, the agreement states members must provide for the protection of plant varieties, either by patents or by an effective <i>sui generis</i> system, that is, a system created specially for this purpose, or by any combination of the two. Developing countries were given an extra four years to apply the provision and in the case of least developed countries, the period was extended by ten years.</P>
      <P>The TRIPS agreement calls for a review of the provisions of Article 27.3.b four years after the agreement entered into force, that is, review in 1999. This review is under way and continuing in the WTO TRIPS Council. Ireland, along with our EU colleagues, is participating on the basis that the review is addressing the manner in which the provision has been implemented and is not an attempt to rewrite the scope of the provision. The Irish and EU position is that Article 27.3.b of TRIPS provides for the necessary flexibility for WTO Members' implementation and that UPOV and other similar harmonised plant variety systems provide effective models for implementing Article 27.3.b. As such, a suspension of the provision is not envisaged or supported.</P>

      <P>Following the publication of Sister Keane's letter in <i>The Irish Times,</i> the issue raised concerning the Ndola Ecumenical Hospice in Zambia was taken up with the World Food Programme through its headquarters in Rome, and an explanation was sought. The WFP has informed us that it received a proposal for a hospital feeding project from Sister Keane in November 2000 which included feeding both terminally ill patients and orphans.</P>
      <P>WFP has told us that, while it has succeeded in providing some assistance to deal with food insecure HIV-AIDS patients, its available resources are very scarce and that difficult choices have to be made. In this case, the WFP took the difficult decision to focus the limited food resources which were available on the orphans. It requested Sister Keane to split her proposal in two for project purposes &ndash; one for the terminally ill patients and one for the orphans. I understand the project for orphans was included in the WFP December distribution plan and will continue to receive food. I have asked our Embassy in Zambia to monitor the situation to assess whether any further intervention on our part is necessary.</P>
      <P>This case is a stark example of the difficult choices many UN agencies are confronted with when donor resources are in decline. The lack of resources severely hampers their ability to address the many needs of developing countries, especially in Africa. For our part, Ireland has been steadily increasing its contributions to UN organisations, including the WFP. Our regular contributions to the WFP, which are provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development have been increased considerably. Our contribution agreed under the food aid convention has increased by more than 60% to a total of £1.2 million. The annual voluntary donation was increased in 2000 by 30% to £1.3 million, giving a total of £2.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Ireland Aid programme also provides funding in response to WFP emergency appeals. In 2000, £2.6 million was provided. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell also recently announced an additional £2.35 million for the WFP to fund its emergency appeals to <Col N="444" /> help some of the areas of the world most threatened by famine and starvation.</P>
    <P>We are also sharply increasing our funding on HIV-AIDS activities to UN organisations, international research into a vaccine and in our bilateral programmes.</P>
    <P>However, Ireland on its own cannot resolve the problem of declining donor resources and the wider donor community must also address the funding deficit if UN agencies are to be in a position to meet the many demands on their resources.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, power was devolved to the Executive and Assembly in Northern Ireland on 2 December 1999, when the British-Irish Agreement entered into force and the other institutions under the Agreement; the North-South Ministerial Council, the implementation bodies and the British-Irish Council, came into operation.</P>
      <P>In the context of difficulties, including on the question of decommissioning, their operation was suspended by the Secretary of State from 11 February until 30 May 2000, when, as a result of the agreement reached by the parties at Hillsborough earlier that month, their powers were fully restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period since, the Assembly and Executive have been carrying out their important work in an effective manner.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The North/South Ministerial Council was established in December 1999, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. The NSMC brings together those with executive responsibilities in Northern Ireland and the Irish Government to develop consultation, cooperation and action within the island of Ireland on matters of mutual interest within the competence of both administrations.</P>
      <P>It was subsequently agreed between the two Governments and the Northern Ireland parties that the Council would focus initially on 12 subject areas in respect of which co-operation and implementation for mutual benefit would take place, with further development of these arrangements to be possible on an agreed basis. Co-operation in these 12 areas is being implemented in two ways. In the case of six of them, it is done by means of existing bodies in each jurisdiction separately, also commonly referred to as the Areas for Co-operation, and in the case of six others by means of new North-South implementation bodies, also commonly referred to as the North-South bodies operating at a cross-border or all-island level.</P>
      <P>The 12 areas are the six areas for co-operation: aspects of agriculture; education; environment; health; transport; and tourism, in respect of which a publicly-owned limited company, Tourism Ireland limited, has been established to promote the entire island of Ireland overseas as a tourist destination.</P>
      <P>The six North/South bodies: Waterways Ireland; the Food Safety Promotion Board; the Trade and Business Development Body, now titled IntertradeIreland; the Special EU Programmes Body; the Language Body, comprising two agencies; Foras na Gaeilge and The Ulster Scots Agency; and the Foyle Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, also comprising two agencies; the Loughs Agency and the Lights Agency.</P>
      <P>The NSMC has responsibility for overseeing co-operation in all 12 areas. In addition to meeting twice a year in plenary format, the Council meets regularly in sectoral format to take forward co-operation in the 12 areas. Since its establishment in December 1999, there have been 26 meetings of the Council, two in plenary format and 24 in sectoral format.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> Overall the Government is pleased with the level of progress that has been made by the Council in the roughly 15 months since its establishment. All of the implementation bodies are up and running, four of them involving boards of directors. In most cases, the permanent chief executives have been appointed, and in the remaining cases the work of the bodies is being taken forward by interim chief executives, pending the making of permanent appointments. Staff are being recruited and headquarters established. Active programmes of work are being undertaken by the bodies, across a broad range of areas. When fully operational, these bodies are expected to employ a total staff of roughly 900 people and they have a budget in 2001 of £64 million I believe that, as they are already demonstrating, these bodies have very great potential in terms of the benefits they can bring to all of the people of this island, North and South.</P>
    <P>In the six areas of co-operation, significant progress has also been made. For instance, Tourism Ireland has been established and the start-up arrangements are well advanced, under the supervision of the board of directors, reporting to my colleague, Minister McDaid and his Northern counterpart, Sir Reg Empey, in the NSMC. In the other important sectors involved, solid progress is also being made, to the mutual benefit of both parts of the island.</P>
    <P>Nobody denies that difficulties remain to be overcome. Regrettably, Sinn Féin Ministers have for some time been prevented from participating in the Council. In their statement of 8 March in Hillsborough, the two Governments recognised that it was essential that the full implementation of the North/South Ministerial Council and the British/Irish Council resume. It is the strong hope of the Government that, following these discussions at Hillsborough chaired by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, the current difficulties will be overcome and the operation of the North/South Ministerial Council can be restored on a fully inclusive basis.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of difficulties in taking forward co-operation in the transport sector, arising from the refusal of the DUP Minister with responsibility for the matter within the Executive to participate in the North/South Ministerial Council. With the co-operation of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, one meeting of the Council has taken place in this sector and the Government is working in close collaboration with them to try to ensure that the work of the NSMC in this important sector can be carried out.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these difficulties, solid progress has been achieved by the North/South Ministerial Council. The 26 meetings of the Council to date have all been positive and constructive occasions. In the various sectoral areas, my colleagues in the Government are working closely and harmoniously with their northern counterparts. In this regard, I should acknowledge that, notwithstanding the difficulties in regard to the <Col N="447" /> nomination of Sinn Féin ministers, the UUP ministers have participated fully and constructively in the many meetings of the NSMC which they have attended. Over time, and particularly once the remaining difficulties have been resolved, I am confident that the Council will play an extremely valuable role in developing practical co-operation to the benefit of North and South and in promoting mutual understanding and reconciliation between the major traditions on the island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations undertaken at the World Trade Organisation have significant implications for development. It is essential that developing countries, particularly the least developed, have the capacity to participate fully in the negotiations and are assisted in implementing the WTO Agreements.</P>
      <P>In October 1997 a high level meeting at the WTO established an integrated framework, IF, to provide trade related technical assistance to least developed countries. The framework brought together the six major agencies &ndash; the WTO, the UN Conference on Trade and Development, the International Trade Centre, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the UN Development Programme, involved in the provision of trade related technical assistance in order to co-ordinate their activities on the basis of needs assessments compiled by the LDCs.</P>
      <P>A review of the IF in 2000 by the World Bank pointed to a number of weaknesses in the framework, not least the fact that it had not been underpinned by adequate financing from donors. In February 2001, the EU presented a proposal at the WTO to establish a pilot trust fund for the IF. The proposal was accepted and the trust fund is now being established. Ireland is giving sympathetic consideration to a contribution.</P>
      <P>The EU has also allocated one million euro to establish an office for its African, Caribbean and Pacific developing country partners in Geneva to help them to co-ordinate in the WTO and to support those ACP countries which have no offices in Geneva. This office will be opened before summer 2001 and will be operated by the ACP secretariat.</P>
      <P>The EU has also been active in calling for the technical assistance activities of the WTO to be put on a firm financial footing. Such activities are funded almost exclusively from voluntary contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a national level, Ireland has joined together with other donors in supporting the establishment <Col N="449" /> of the Advisory Centre on WTO Law. This is an independent body, existing outside the WTO, which will help developing countries with legal advice to enable them to take full advantage of their rights under the WTO agreements. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment contributed $1 million to help establish the centre while Ireland Aid has committed $250,000 per year for five years to help finance the running costs of the centre.</P>
    <P>Ireland Aid has also contributed $100,000 to the Global Trust Fund of the WTO which provides trade related technical assistance for developing countries.</P>
    <P>The UN Conference on Trade and Development, to which Ireland Aid has given several contributions, including $180,000 to its trust fund for LDCs, is closely working with developing countries to defend their interests in the WTO. UNCTAD has helped prepare the so-called, positive agenda, which sets out the key concerns of developing countries in relation to a new global trade round. The positive agenda has played an important role in discussions at the WTO where it has been successful in focusing attention on the development aspects of a future global trade round.</P>

      <P>The agreement reached at Nice provides the basis for the effective functioning of an enlarged European Union, while at the same time maintaining essential institutional balances. It is clearly in Ireland's interest that a union with a significantly increased membership be in a position to take decisions and to function properly, while ensuring that the rights of individual member states are protected. The outcome at Nice fully meets these requirements.</P>
      <P>By completing the process of internal institutional reform within the period envisaged, Nice allows preparations for enlargement to proceed on schedule. By providing the basis for countries from east and west to come together in a framework of democracy and human rights, enlargement lays the basis for a new stability in Europe, from which all will gain. In addition, Irish business is particularly well placed to realise the potential economic benefits of an enlarged Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the institutional changes agreed at Nice, they represent a reasonable compromise, while also respecting essential Irish interests. While we were ready to facilitate agreement on a <Col N="450" /> significant extension of QMV, we insisted that this should not include taxation. This was agreed.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Commission, the five large member states will give up their second commissioner from the start of the next Commission. Each member state will have a commissioner until the union reaches 27, at which point the Council is required to decide by unanimity on a smaller Commission. Most importantly, any such rotation will operate on the basis of strict equality among member states. Ireland will therefore be represented on the Commission on the same basis as, for example, France or Germany.</P>
    <P>The agreement on the re-weighting of votes in the Council takes into account the understanding reached at Amsterdam whereby those states giving up their second commissioner would in turn have their voting weight increased. The agreed outcome provides that Ireland will continue to have the same voting weight as Denmark and Finland.</P>
    <P>The outcome in relation to the European Parliament is also satisfactory from an Irish perspective, with our allocation of seats at the top of the range proposed by the Presidency at Nice. The explicit confirmation in the treaty, for the first time, of the right of each member state to nominate a member of the Court of Justice, and of the Court of Auditors, is also satisfactory from Ireland's viewpoint. Finally, the decisions in relation to enhanced cooperation will allow countries, including Ireland, to take advantage of this procedure, while at the same time, as sought by Ireland, incorporating sufficient safeguards to ensure that the overall coherence of the Union is maintained.</P>

      <P>The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: (a) persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; (b) persons wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; (c) persons without both hands or without both arms; (d) persons without one or both legs; (e) persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; (f) persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
      <P>The disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme is under review by an interdepartmental committee under the chair of an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand that the work of the committee is on-going. It would be imprudent of me to consider any amendments to the scheme until such time as the review is completed and its content is given due consideration.</P>

      <P>A joint working group representing the General Council and Joint Industrial Council Unions and the official side was formed in September 2000 to advise on the development of criteria for the next stage of decentralisation and to report by 31 October 2000. The formation of the working group was designed to give the unions the opportunity to make an input in relation to issues such as who is to go, where are they to go and when do they go. In particular, it was formed to allow them put forward views on the criteria which might be used in arriving at these decisions, including the decisions on the choice of locations. The official side considered that it would not be appropriate that the merits or demerits of particular locations should be discussed as part of the process.</P>
      <P>The group met on four occasions between 6 October and 27 November 2000. At the final meeting of the group, most of the unions indicated that they were no longer prepared to participate in the work of the group due to dissatisfaction on their part at the official side's not being prepared to conduct a survey of the unions' members to establish their preferences as regards locations. The official side did not consider that it was appropriate or necessary for them to survey the members of the unions to establish their preferences as regards locations. The official side took the view that the appropriate way to proceed was to agree on the criteria which might be used by the Government when deciding locations. The Civil and Public Service Union indicated at the final meeting of the group that it could bring the matter of the criteria to a conclusion and would convey its views direct to the official side. These views were subsequently conveyed and full account will be taken of them when final decisions are being taken by the Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated to the Deputy previously, the <Col N="454" /> development of centres of excellence for the treatment of symptomatic breast disease will commence this year. The health boards have statutory responsibility for the provision of health services and the timeframe for the development of centres of excellence varies between boards. All health boards are currently considering how best to implement the recommendations in the report, having regard to a number of factors including consultant appointments, the physical infrastructure of the unit to be developed, and equipping requirements. The development of centres of excellence for the treatment and care of symptomatic breast disease will take place over the next number of years.</P>
    <P>In my reply to Question No. 523 from the Deputy on 30 January last, I indicated that funding of £4.315 million was allocated this year for symptomatic breast disease services. In fact, total funding made available in 2001 for the development of services for the treatment of symptomatic breast disease is £4.35 million. This includes £4.115 million for the development of centres of excellence and a total of £0.235 million for post-operative services to women diagnosed with breast disease. The funding has been allocated as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 99 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>I am committed to addressing the need for an appropriate GP out of hours service. In that regard, I have already funded two major pilot GP out of hours co-operative projects in the SEHB and NEHB areas. Both those projects are well resourced ventures offering participating GPs strong back-up in terms of personnel support and facilities. The objective is to ensure proper patient care combined with offering participating GPs a structured means of organising their out of hours commitments that significantly reduces their actual on call workload.</P>
      <P>In both cases, general practitioners have been involved from the outset in promoting and establishing the co-ops. That is certainly consistent with my overall approach to this area which is that all out of hours initiatives must fully involve health boards and general practitioners working together in their introduction and development.</P>
      <P>As agreed in advance, both pilot projects are now being evaluated. The results of that evaluation will allow decisions to be made by all involved on the future direction of the out of hours response. It may be that other options will come to the fore as being appropriate either locally or nationally, for example, in the Dublin area, the DUBDOC project &ndash; which is also funded by the Department &ndash; is an interesting alternative to the co-op model that might be further developed.</P>
      <P>It is in order to promote GP involvement and to identify possible alternatives that my Department is organising a national out of hours conference. The event was originally scheduled for the end of this month but was postponed on account of the foot and mouth situation. It has now been provisionally rescheduled for the 27 April and will be held in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a further element in this strategic approach, my Department convened a meeting of all health board primary care units last November and it was unanimously agreed that it would be best to <Col N="458" /> progress the roll-out of actual out of hours projects on an incremental basis that allowed for their proper development in each health board.</P>
    <P>It was that consensus that informed the allocations of moneys in 2001 to each health board for out of hours development. The individual allocations were as follows:</P>

    <P>The moneys allocated fully reflect the incremental approach being pursued and agreed with the boards in November. Funding for the NEHB and SEHB relates to the current operation of their pilot projects. The funding allocated to the SHB is to enable it to be the next board to undertake a major out of hours project in 2001. The moneys allocated to the other boards are primarily to allow them to undertake the infrastructural work necessary prior to the introduction of a major out of hours project in their areas.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the approach outlined above is the best way to proceed if we are to introduce a proper value for money out of hours GP service that benefits both patients and doctors in a meaningful way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 to 105, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Last month the chairman of the National Blood Users Group, Professor John Bonnar, and I announced a new guideline for transfusion of red blood cells in surgical patients. The guideline provides specific advice to clinicians in relation to best practice in transfusion and the application of strategies which reduce or avoid transfusion as part of the management of patients requiring surgery. The guideline recommends that the use of proven strategies to reduce exposure to allogeneic transfusion should be made widely available, and applied where appropriate. Such strategies include autologous transfusion techniques, and surgical, anaesthetic and pharmacological techniques to reduce blood loss.</P>
      <P>Given the importance of this guideline, my Department's chief medical officer, wrote to clinicians and advised that, although it is not known whether vCJD can be passed from person to person by blood transfusion, avoidance of unnecessary transfusion of allogeneic blood constitutes the most important approach available at this time in reducing any possible risk to patients of infection with vCJD through blood transfusion. My Department has circulated the guideline to hospitals throughout the country and to general practitioners.</P>
      <P>The National Blood Users Group is preparing additional guidelines on neonatal and paediatric transfusion, use of platelets and plasma, administration of blood products, use of blood products in the management of massive haemorrhage and these are expected to issue later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a question from the Deputy on 31 January 2001, I advised of a number of strategies under consideration by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service to reduce or minimise the possible risk of the transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion in the absence of a test to detect the presence of vCJD in blood donors. The possible strategies included the deferral of donors who resided in the UK and the sourcing of blood products from BSE free countries. On 14 March 2001, the IBTS announced its decision to defer donors who spent a cumulative period of five years in the UK during the period 1980 to 1996. The implementation of this decision will reduce the existing donor pool by 5%. In advance of this announcement, I met with the IBTS and the CJD <Col N="460" /> Advisory Group. The CJD group advised me that while it supported the IBTS donor deferral proposal, it was of the view that efforts should be in place to replace the potential supply deficit, prior to its introduction. On 8 March the IBTS briefed me in detail in relation to its plans to address the potential shortfall in donations which include the following: (i) recruitment of new donors to replace deferred donors; (ii) encouraging lapsed donors to donate and occasional donors to increase their donations; (iii) improving the management of the donor programme by extending clinic opening hours and opening a fixed clinic in Ardee in March and establish additional fixed donor clinics in Dublin, Limerick and Galway; (iv) improving blood stock management nationally to reduce the level of blood discards; (v) implementing focused and local media advertising campaigns to encourage donors to attend local donor clinics.</P>
    <P>At my suggestion, the CJD Advisory Group and the IBTS met on 12 March. At the meeting the IBTS advised the group of its plans, and reassured the group as to its concerns about the balance of risks involved and the need to ensure an adequate blood supply.</P>
    <P>Maintaining an adequate blood supply will require effective management throughout the health system involving the IBTS and hospitals. It will require a significant response from donors and the recruitment of new donors. Donors have always responded generously and I am confident that they will continue to do so. I am establishing a national blood strategy implementation group to address the potential impact on hospital blood supplies of the deferral decision. The group will seek to improve blood stock management, progress the use of alternatives to blood transfusion, widen availability of autologous transfusion and support the implementation of the red cell guideline I referred to earlier. The group will comprise representatives of the hospitals, IBTS and my Department. Extensive monitoring of the impact of the current deferral decision will take place in the coming months to assess the success of the measures undertaken to replace the 5% reduction in donors.</P>
    <P>As regards the sourcing of blood products from non-BSE countries, the IBTS is currently assessing the availability of plasma and fibrinogen to replace its fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate, respectively. The Irish Medicines Board, the regulatory authority for the importation of medicinal products, including blood products, has statutory responsibility in relation to the authorisation of medicinal products for use here. The IBTS has advised the IMB in relation to its strategy and further discussions will take place concerning any specific proposals of the IBTS to import replacement blood products.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the level of administration of oral polio vaccine after its expiry date my Department has requested health boards to examine all childhood immunisation records to determine if children were given out of date vaccine.</P>
      <P>Health boards have also been asked to take appropriate measures in respect of vaccines administered from this point forward to ensure the validation of all key information i.e. patient name, batch number and expiry date by cross reference to registration and supply databases.</P>
      <P>Additionally, health boards have been requested to examine how the administration of out of date vaccines occurred and the measures which should be put in place to prevent a recurrence. This matter has also been brought to the attention of the Irish College of General Practitioners who have been asked to review the matter and to consider the development of protocols in respect of vaccine administration.</P>
      <P>In view of this incident, health boards have been asked to examine systems and procedures currently in place, identify shortcomings where these exist and put in place revised systems or procedures as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>In addition, the chief executive officers of the health boards have established a national immunisation steering committee, which is addressing a wide range of issues relating to the primary childhood immunisation programme. This will include consideration of the protocols for administration of vaccines, whether new mechanisms need to be developed to guard against possible use of vaccine which has passed its expiry date and to ensure that vaccines are administered in accordance with best practice. My Department has, to date, not received a proposal from the Irish Medical Organisation regarding the introduction of immunisation smart cards but such a proposal will of course be considered by the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is involved in ongoing communication with the Irish Medicines Board regarding the labelling of vaccines and expiry date issues. The IMB has indicated that it is investigating issues relating to expiry date practice and will report once these investigations have been completed. In addition, the Irish Medicines <Col N="462" /> Board has been requested to consider the introduction of peel-off labels for all vaccines which would contain the batch number and the expiry date of the vaccine. This system would minimise recording errors, particularly in relation to batch number and expiry date, and improve the quality of vaccine data recording at both health board and GP level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to recent correspondence between President Bush and a number of US Senators. It is a matter solely for the US Administration to determine its own domestic policy for reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions to tackle climate change.</P>
      <P>I understand that the US Administration is undertaking a thorough reassessment of its approach to climate change, including the ongoing international negotiations, and that no assumptions about US policy should be made until that review is complete. The EU, for its part, has emphasised that the Kyoto Protocol is the outcome of many years of negotiations and offers an effective framework for global action to reduce emissions. The European Council of Environment Ministers has urged all countries to engage constructively in negotiations on modalities for implementing the protocol and to formulate negotiating positions as soon as possible to facilitate a successful outcome at the resumed COP6 negotiations in Bonn next July. The EU has also reaffirmed its openness to a continuing dialogue with all countries in this process.</P>
      <P>I endorse the EU view, most recently expressed by the Swedish Presidency in response to the US developments, that efficient international action to combat climate change is necessary and that the Kyoto Protocol is the basis for advising this action.</P>
      <P>I welcome President Bush's commitment to work with friends and allies to develop technologies, market incentives and other creative ways to address global climate change. I consider that this can best be done by creating the conditions for ratification and entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol by 2002.</P>

      <Quest>if the voting technology selected for the trials for electronic voting in elections provided an audit trail whereby the final result can be tracked back to the original ballot; the form of testing which is being undertaken to proof the system against viruses or tampering; and the advantages which he perceives from electronic voting at general elections compared to the present system.</Quest>

      <P>I propose take Questions Nos. 117 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>Tender prices for the provision of an electronic voting and counting system ranged from £20 million (25.4 million) to £48 million (61million). The successful tender was received from a Dutch-UK company Nedap-Powervote in the amount of £25 million (31.7 million). Phase 1 of the project will involve extensive testing of the voting machine, election management software and PR-STV count software. Testing will be undertaken by my Department, returning officers, the Local Government Computer Services Board and by independent third parties to ensure the integrity of the system. A contract will only be entered into with the preferred supplier following successful testing and Government approval. The system chosen provides for an audit trail which can produce a complete list of votes and preferences cast by voters allowing a manual count to take place, if so ordered by the High Court.</P>
      <P>The move to electronic voting and counting will involve a radical change to the way in which elections are held in this country. It will make it easier for the public to vote, provide election results within a few hours of close of poll, improve the efficiency of electoral administration, support a positive image of the country in use of information technology and will help to modernise our democracy.</P>

However, a grant may be allowed where the marriage of the person has been dissolved or annulled by court order, or the person is separated under a court order or a deed of separation and the person and any dependants are in need of housing; and the Minister is satisfied that refusal to pay a grant would cause undue hardship. Each such application is considered on its merits. In this particular case, having regard to the applicant's income, it has not been possible to authorise payment of a grant.</P>

      <P>A grant of £430,000 was allocated to Wicklow County Council under the public private partnership fund for local authorities on 29 June 2000, for a proposed development at Greystones harbour and north beach. Subsequently, a submission from Wicklow County Council was received by my Department which raised the issue of a number of tax concessions which may benefit the development.</P>
      <P>The proposals included a request that residential owner occupier and residential investor tax incentives be made available for the development. These incentives are available at present for sites designated under the urban renewal scheme, 1999, and the town renewal scheme, 2000. The selection of towns and the recommendations regarding designations were undertaken by the relevant local authorities and the expert advisory panel respectively, in accordance with detailed guidelines. Greystones was not one of the towns proposed by Wicklow County Council for consideration under the town renewal scheme and there are no proposals to make further designations at present.</P>
      <P>The other proposal relates to the amendment of the definition of a dock as it applies to the availability of tax allowances to encompass the proposed development. This will be given due consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Finance in conjunction with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. However, I am aware that part of this examination will include consideration of the proposal by reference to EU state aid rules.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Garda authorities that on 9 March 2001, at 3.20 p.m., a telephone call was received at Mullingar Garda station on the emergency telephone service from the person in question, reporting that he had been attacked and robbed in his home by two young men. The detective unit in Mullingar was immediately dispatched to the scene. The garda on duty in Kinnegad sub-district was unavailable, as he was engaged on other duties at the time. The garda on duty at Mullingar Station also contacted the ambulance control and requested that an ambulance be dispatched to the scene. He then telephoned the person in question and informed him that the gardaí and an ambulance were on the way. To reassure the victim, the garda continued to speak with him for up to ten <Col N="470" /> minutes while awaiting the arrival of the gardaí and the ambulance. The person in question resides approximately 14 miles from Mullingar.</P>
      <P>The gardaí arrived at approximately 3.50 p.m. and obtained details of the incident prior to the person being removed to hospital, from which he was released later on that day. I am assured by the Garda authorities that a full investigation into this matter is under way. I am further informed by Garda authorities that at no time was the victim advised that there were no gardaí available.</P>
      <P>I would encourage all crime victims to report any crime to the Garda authorities. In order to reduce attacks on the elderly, gardaí are actively involved in giving advice on appropriate preventative measures, identifying and apprehending offenders, deterring would-be offenders, promoting co-operation and good relations between the elderly and the community, and also liaising with local groups such as Muintir na Tíre, the ICA etc. The gardaí also encourage the establishment of neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes. I have no reason to doubt the reliability of the crime figures published by the Garda Commissioner, which have shown an overall decrease in crime levels in recent years.</P>

      <P>To mark the occasion of the UN International Day Against Racism on 21 March, I issued a statement affirming the Government's determination to combat any tendency towards racism and racist acts and calling for support in creating a society which is devoid of prejudice and discrimination.</P>
      <P>I also welcomed the large number of activities which had been organised to focus attention on the international day. In particular, the activity pack for schools entitled, Raising Awareness &ndash; Diversity and Racism, which was produced by the national consultative committee on racism and interculturalism in partnership with the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. The activity pack is designed to provide ideas for those working with young people in schools or more informal education settings who are interested in exploring cultural diversity and raising awareness about racism. The pack is consistent with our preparations for the forthcoming public awareness programme against racism.</P>
      <P>I also welcomed the initiative of the Garda racial and intercultural office in producing the Garda anti-racism training video entitled, Challenge It, the anti-racism week in third level colleges organised by the Union of Students in Ireland and a football tournament between invited youth groups organised by Pavee Point Traveller centre. Other highlights marking the occasion are special local radio programmes, concerts, open days and seminars. Unfortunately, some events had to be postponed due to the foot and mouth disease crisis.</P>
      <P>To coincide with the occasion, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees launched a UNHCR video for primary schools. The video is available free of charge from the UNHCR office in Dublin. RTE also announced the expansion of its One World service. One World is a multicultural radio service broadcasting on the medium wave, which reflects the ethnic diversity of refugees, asylum seekers and the immigrant communities in Ireland. It employs a number of reporters from those communities and provides news in different languages.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> Last month, I announced the chairman and members of the high level steering group to implement the three-year national anti-racism interculturalism public awareness programme. The primary objectives of the awareness programme are to act as a catalyst to stimulate public awareness and understanding of cultural diversity in Ireland; to help create the conditions that make it more difficult for racism to exist; and to contribute to the range of policies that promote an inclusive approach to minority ethnic groups, including refugees and asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>The awareness programme will receive Government funding of £4.5 million over a three-year period. This funding will enable the group to design and implement a comprehensive set of actions aimed at ensuring that racism does not gain a foothold in our society.</P>

      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government is committed to targeting investment under the national development plan on a priority basis to the 25 most disadvantaged areas in the State. In order to ensure a fair and transparent process, the selection of these 25 areas was made on strictly objective criteria using factors such as unemployment, income levels, family and social structure, educational disadvantage and high levels of rented local authority housing.</P>
      <P>The 25 areas selected represent the most deprived 5% district electoral divisions &ndash; DEDs &ndash; in the country, whereas Ringsend would be amongst the most deprived 10% or just outside the acute most deprived 5% category. Extending the remit of the scheme to encompass all areas in the 10% most deprived category would not only go against the commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, but would also risk diluting the impact and objectives of the scheme because of the number of areas which would then be involved.</P>
      <P>However, the fact that Ringsend is not designated amongst the most deprived 5% does not preclude it from benefiting from social inclusion funds of £15 billion available under the national development plan. As a local representative I will be ensuring that the newly established Dublin City Development Board will avail fully of the various support funds available to address any problems in the Ringsend area.</P>

      <P>I have already indicated my concern at the impact of foot and mouth disease precautions on the tourism industry and I am fully aware of the current difficulties in relation to restricted access to our national cultural and heritage attractions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> The possibility of foot and mouth disease &ndash; FMD &ndash; spreading to this country threatens our economic security and livelihoods, not just those of our farmers and the agriculture and food sector, but potentially of virtually every citizen. Agriculture and livestock are of such vital importance to the whole Irish economy that we have to be thorough in our efforts to make sure that the disease does not spread further with disastrous consequences. While I welcomed the easing of foot and mouth disease controls announced recently by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the position is now obviously under review in the light of today's developments.</P>
    <P>My Department and Bord Fáilte continue to work closely with the tourism industry to monitor developments and to advise on the impact of the control measures to date. The objective is to ensure that all reasonable efforts are made to enable tourism within Ireland to continue to operate, while ensuring that the industry does not take unnecessary risks that would jeopardise our agriculture base. I would like to express my appreciation for the support of the tourism industry in recent weeks and look forward to their continuing co-operation to overcome our current difficulties. I am anxious that there is a clear message that Ireland remains open for tourism business and that, subject to the taking of appropriate precautions, Ireland remains a welcoming destination for international visitors.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease has the potential to cause enormous economic damage to our agriculture and food processing sectors. It would have far reaching implications for our export markets, which would permeate through the entire economy. The full commitment of the entire population is necessary if we are to succeed in our efforts to prevent the spread of the disease. This is a national issue, which has the potential to adversely effect the well-being of everyone in the country, and our response must reflect the gravity of the situation.</P>
      <P>My Department, based on the advice of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, has advised the authorities of all primary and post-primary schools of the recommended measures to prevent an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in this country. My Department continues to liaise on an ongoing basis with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development as the situation evolves.</P>
      <P>The current advice from my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, is that unnecessary travel to the UK and other foot and mouth disease infected areas should not take place. Accordingly, I advise schools not to undertake school tours to the UK or other foot and mouth disease affected areas. The Deputy will appreciate that travel insurance is a matter between individual schools and their insurers. In the circumstances, for advice on the matters raised by the Deputy, schools should make direct contact with the relevant travel agent and insurance company for their advice on the matters raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The establishment of the public service benchmarking body was agreed as an integral part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness arrangements on public service pay. It has been agreed between the public services committee of the ICTU and the Government as employer that certain selected grades only shall be subject to detailed examination by the benchmarking body. The teaching grades to be examined include principal, deputy principal, assistant principal, special duties teacher and teachers in the primary and post-primary sectors.</P>
      <P>The public service benchmarking body has been asked to produce its report and recommendations by 30 June 2002. This timescale has been agreed with the relevant trade unions and the Government as employer. A single report is to be produced covering all grades, groups and categories within the benchmarking body's terms of reference.</P>
      <P>Benchmarking is about comparing public service pay and jobs with pay and jobs across the economy with a view to ensuring that public service rates of pay compare favourably with comparable employment in the private sector. This was the objective of the Government and the public service unions in framing the benchmarking process and establishing the public service benchmarking body. Benchmarking is not about performance related pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from discussions with the benchmarking body, it has been agreed that the process will include written submissions by unions and employers, with both sides exchanging their submissions, thereby giving an opportunity for comment by both sides on the position of the other. The body will arrange its own research pro<Col N="481" /> gramme and it is envisaged that there will be feedback from this to the parties. There will then be oral hearings attended by both sides. The submissions, research and oral hearings will form the benchmarking body's deliberations and it will recommend rates of pay for all of the groups. The public service benchmarking body has sought written submissions from management and trade unions by 20 March 2001 and is already in the process of arranging the appropriate research. It intends to hold oral hearings in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Although employers and unions will have to negotiate the how and when of implementation, they will not be renegotiating the recommendations themselves. An agreement reached between the Government and the trade unions in December 2000 provides for payment of 25% of any increase with effect from 1 December 2001.</P>

      <P>The Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, provides for the establishment of three new bodies: the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council. I established the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland on a statutory basis on 26 February last and it is my intention to establish the two new awarding councils in the near future.</P>
      <P>The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland has three objects as set out in the qualifications Act: (1) to establish and maintain a framework of qualifications for the development, recognition and award of qualifications based on standards of knowledge, skill or competence to be acquired by learners; (2)to establish and promote the maintenance and improvement of the standards of awards of the further and higher education and training sector, other than in the existing universities, and (3) to promote and facilitate access, transfer and progression throughout the education and training provision.</P>
      <P>In meeting these objectives, the authority will establish policies and criteria on which the framework of qualifications will be based and review the operation of the framework. It will also establish procedures for the performance of their functions by the two awarding councils, as well as determining procedures to be implemented by providers in relation to access, transfer and progression. The authority will also ensure that the Dublin Institute of Technology and any university that may be established in the future implement such procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> Furthermore, the authority will advise the existing universities in implementing such procedures and will also review their implementation in consultation with the Higher Education Authority. The authority will also consult with and advise the Minister for Education and Science or any other Minister on matters relating to its functions and liaise with bodies outside the State for the mutual recognition of awards. The authority will inform itself of the education and training needs of industry and promote practices in education and training to meet those needs and will also consult with relevant bodies.</P>

      <P>The provisions of section 29(8) of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999, enable the Minister to give effect to the recommendations of the independent review group, chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelly, on Waterford Institute of Technology. When the Act is brought fully into operation, it is intended that the Higher Education and Training Awards Council and the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland will be directed, under the terms of this section, to implement the recommendations of the report of the review group.</P>

      <P>The position is that of those engaged to assist in the certificate examinations each year, it is estimated that about 5% are non-teachers. My Department appointed 4,555 superintendents for <Col N="483" /> the 2000 certificate written examinations. In addition, schools appointed over 2,000 supervisors for special centres, practical examinations and aural examinations. The number of examiners involved in marking the written, oral and practical tests in the 2000 certificate examinations is set out in the following table:</P>

      <P>An application has been received for an extension at the school to which the Deputy <Col N="484" /> refers. In advance of commencing a capital development programme at the school and consistent with standard practices, it has been necessary to determine the school's long-term projected enrolment. This process is complete and the school's long-term projected enrolment has been determined to be 650 students.</P>
      <P>The next step in the process is the analysis of the school's curricular strategy. In this context, the school's management authority has been requested to complete an educational worksheet. When the completed document is returned to my Department, the task of determining the school's accommodation needs will begin.</P>
