      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 49, Youth Work Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage (Resumed); No. 1 &ndash; Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill, 2000 <i>[Seanad]</i>&ndash; Second Stage; and No. 7 &ndash; Sea Pollution (Hazardous and Noxious Substances) (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals to put to the House. I will now take Leaders' questions but before doing so I find it necessary to remind the Leaders that on the Order of Business a relevant but brief question on a topical matter may be asked. There should be no statements on any matter that would give rise to a debate. It is not an occasion for a mini-debate on any issue with only a brief question and reply permitted.</P>

      <P>The rules keep changing, a Cheann Comhairle. I wish to ask the Tánaiste two brief questions. Will there be an opportunity for the Taoiseach to report to the House on his meeting with Prime Minister Blair yesterday on the outcome of their talks?</P>
      <P>What is the Government's current policy on waste management given the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's announcement that he is giving powers to county managers to adopt and put in place waste management plans in countries where such plans have not been adopted? The announcement was made outside the House and there has been no further explanation. It is giving rise to a great deal of confusion among councillors and the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope during Question Time next week the Taoiseach will be able to respond in relation to Northern Ireland. It was a good meeting last night but some work still has to be done to have a comprehensive package that will allow the current difficulties in the peace process to be resolved. I hope the work today and for the remainder of this week will lead to a comprehen<Col N="1018" /> sive package on decommissioning, policing and demilitarisation.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has put proposals before the Cabinet. I am not at liberty to discuss them but as soon as the issue is decided I am sure the Minister will make an announcement. However, it is important that we have an appropriate waste strategy that can be implemented and acted upon at local level. It is essential for our environment, industry and the country that we have the necessary powers to implement a modern and appropriate waste strategy plan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Newspapers have already published the proposals. Was this a judicious leak so that the Minister would get credit or was it a way of warning councillors that they would lose powers? What is the truth in regard to waste management? It is one of the major issues facing local authorities, householders and industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste aware that I wrote to the Taoiseach on 4 January drawing to his attention a conflict of interest involving the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in his role as joint treasurer of Fianna Fáil on the one hand and as Minister responsible for raising limits by 50% on the moneys that can be spent on elections, changing the rules that have served us well over the past five by-elections? Is she, as Tánaiste and leader of the Progressive Democrats, in favour of this conflict of interest? Has she raised the matter with the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware the Deputy wrote to the Taoiseach because he has raised the issue on the Order of Business over the past two days and I have read about it in the press. I do not accept there is a conflict of interest in regard to this matter. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has been open in relation to his proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Tánaiste, in her capacity as a member of Government and as leader of the Progressive Democrats, in favour of this continued conflict of interest between the Minister responsible for putting the legislation through the House and for arbitrarily and unilaterally altering these figures as far back as February 2000? Is that the Progressive Democrats' position?</P>

      <P>The matter is before the Cabinet and as soon as the Cabinet concludes its deliberations the proposals will be published. That Deputy Shatter is a lawyer does not mean there is a conflict of interest between being a lawyer and being a spokesperson on justice. He should be careful in what he is saying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards No. 5 on today's Order Paper, the Ombudsman's report on nursing home subventions that has been laid before the House, has the Government made a decision to produce amending legislation, or clarify existing legislation, as to whether medical card holders <Col N="1021" /> are entitled to have nursing home care provided by the State? This report contains a litany of scandalous treatment of people. What decisions has the Government made on foot of the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was published yesterday and is being considered by the Minister for Health and Children. If legislation is required it will be forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The report has been with the Minister for quite some time, so I would have expected a more forthright answer concerning action on this issue. Is the Tánaiste aware that last night on RTE's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme there was an exposé of serious problems in the health service, including the fact that people are literally dying as they await operations because they cannot afford private treatment? In recent days the Government received a policy document on how the Labour Party intends to deal with this matter. Can we now have a statement from the Government, that can be debated in the House, about how it intends to end the two-tier hospital system that is not delivering services to those most in need? It is continuing the suffering and pain of thousands of people who are waiting for necessary operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should confine herself to a question on promised legislation. Is there any promised legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we have a statement from the Government as to how it intends to deal with this vital issue that is destroying people's lives? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss this matter. This is the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste address the issue because it is of such vital importance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put on the record my appreciation of the statesman-like service that Deputy John Bruton, both as Taoiseach and as Leader of the Opposition, has given to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Deputies Deputies">
      <NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a great privilege to work with him. There are not too many people of that stature in the House. The House should be very appreciative of the service he has given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the issue that has been raised by Deputy McManus, the Minister for Health and Children has indicated that he will bring forward a major document in response to the Fine Gael and Labour Parties' documents on health. I understand that it will be a White Paper. If I have interpreted the Minister for Health and Children correctly, will the Tánaiste say if it is intended to introduce a White Paper on health? If that is not the case, can we find time to debate the contents <Col N="1022" /> of the programme on RTE last night which was very upsetting and very accurate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Gay Mitchell in paying tribute to Deputy John Bruton. I do not want to interfere in the affairs of another party, but Deputy Bruton is one of the original thinkers in this House of which he has been a Member since 1969. He has been Taoiseach, Minister for Finance twice, Minister for Industry and Commerce, Minister for Industry and Energy, and also held a number of junior ministerial posts. I think I can speak for everybody in the House when I say that we wish him well. He is an honest, decent person of the highest integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>He is still alive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember that on the day the Good Friday Agreement was successfully negotiated, I heard Deputy Bruton on the radio and he was wholesome in his praise of the Taoiseach. He certainly put the national interest first while, perhaps, other Opposition leaders might have chosen to find holes in the agreement. I wish him and his family well.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children has proposals to radically reform the health service. An internal audit of the health service is currently under way. As Deputies know, spending in this area has almost doubled over the past three years, so it is not just an issue of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>We need a fairly radical reform of the health service.</P>

Will measures be included in that Bill to allow for the exclusion of non-nationals from entry to the State? That was the information given to me by way of a reply yesterday. More than 100 people were excluded from embarking&mdash;</P>

Can the Tánaiste justify the Department of Health and Children spending £600,000 on this when people on hospital waiting lists are dying, and we have the sort of exposure on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night of the difficulties in the health service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. The definition of the functions of the Minister regarding youth work has long been required. There is a need for clarity in this area, particularly for some groups of young people. The issues dealt with in the Bill are very important. I welcome also the fact that the Bill defines the functions of the vocational education committees in this area. Vocational education committees, including, for example, the vocational education committee in Wicklow, provide extremely good supports for young people particularly those who have lost out on other opportunities. In this regard I would remind the Minister of a campaign which is going on throughout the country for funding for VTOs schemes. The VTOs schemes have been welcome. While it is probably outside the context of this Bill I point out that the allocation of £15,000 for every 20 students going through VTOs has been more or less frozen for a number of years. VTOs is a big issue in my constituency where it provides excellent support for young people. Most Members on all sides would urge that this issue be reviewed.</P>
      <P>I also believe the idea of an assessor of youth work and the establishment of a national youth work advisory committee will be welcomed on all sides. As a member of the VEC I welcome the establishment of the youth work committees and look forward to the establishment in County Wicklow of a local youth council. This will help to bring together the young people and people in the community who care for young people.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has the opportunity I would like to hear from him on VTOs funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I am delighted to see young people in the gallery. No doubt the provisions of this Bill will affect them in some way. I introduced a Private Members' Bill on this subject in the early 1990s. I am pleased to see that many of the provisions outlined in that Bill are contained in this Bill. Also Deputy Allen introduced a Bill in 1997 which, no doubt, helped the whole thought process that led to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the research carried out by the Minister's officials as background to this Bill they would have looked at the Department's records going back to the 1970s when the then spokesperson on youth affairs, Deputy John Bruton, did considerable work in this whole area. When I was researching my Bill I discovered that. He introduced some original thinking at that time <Col N="1030" /> to the whole concept of youth work. This was followed by the Costello report which was the bible for a number of years as regards reference by those involved in youth services. The whole process of the Bill has been a long one but I am glad it has arrived. While youth services welcome this Bill, nevertheless there are some questions that must be clarified, the big one being funding.</P>
    <P>All young people should be entitled to a youth service as is the case in the rest of Europe. If one looks at the map of youth services, there are some areas where there are not any youth services. I shall refer to that later. In the past, youth services have been targeted at disadvantaged areas and rightly so especially in urban areas. Obviously disadvantage manifests itself more clearly in an urban area. However, there are many problems in rural areas as well but they are not being addressed by any youth service. From the point of view rural regeneration and so on, it is important to encourage young people to respect their community, to look at ways of developing their communities and to form an attachment and an affinity with their communities. Without the presence of a youth service that is difficult to inculcate in young people. While it is the objective of the Bill that there would be youth services throughout the country, no doubt involving the vocational education committees would help, but it should be a right of all young people to have a properly funded youth service because the impact of a youth service is considerable.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the increase in the drugs culture among young people and to other forms of anti-social behaviour. It is obvious that where there are properly funded well-organised, well structured youth services young people have an alternative. Despite all the information on drug abuse, substance abuse and under age drinking these problems are on the increase. Certainly one the main ways of encouraging people to do other things and not engage in anti-social behaviour is to introduce them to youth club activities. As the Costello report pointed out, generic youth work should be available to all young people.</P>
    <P>Most youth work in Ireland is driven by volunteers and, in some cases, with the support of paid youth workers. As this is the international year of the volunteer I urge the Government to do something positive to encourage volunteerism. I recall the Taoiseach praising and extolling the work of volunteers recently in some interview. The last two budgets have been anti-volunteerism in the sense that they have penalised those who decide to stay at home. In the case of a partnership, a husband and wife team, if both have to work it means there is less time for one or other of them to work in a local youth club or whatever. Is there any possibility  &ndash; this is something the Minister's officials might examine &ndash; that daily work in youth clubs could be acknowledged as part of a person's work; in other words, a teacher who spends two hours at youth work would be given time out or it might be easier for somebody work<Col N="1031" /> ing in a Government Department. In the private sector if it was validated and people were to get time out for youth work, they would be compensated either by their employer or through the tax system. It is worth looking at.</P>
    <P>The number of volunteers is on the decrease because of the pressures of life and so on and the fact that people are doing other things. Also, at times, these people are not appreciated and do not get due recognition from the system or, perhaps, from the parents whose children they look after. In many cases all they get is criticism. In this age of litigation there are youth workers who have volunteered to take young people to football matches, sporting events and so who end up in court because of an accident or something else. There are huge obstacles in the way of volunteerism here. While there is still great community effort in that people devote a great deal of time to football clubs, youth clubs and so on there is not the same enthusiasm as in the past.</P>
    <P>I understand the national youth work plan is in place and will come into operation shortly. There must be clarification on the budget for youth work. In addition, a budget must be set aside for the implementation of the plan. There are more plans than buildings for youth workers and in the area of sport, recreation and so on. However, there is no commitment in the Bill or elsewhere to provide a realistic budget to ensure that all the proposals and recommendations in the national youth work plan will be properly funded.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware at least five Departments are involved in funding youth work. The Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Tourism, Sport and Recreation are all involved. There are probably others, for example, the Department of Foreign Affairs provides funding through its cultural scheme that encourages young people to travel abroad to promote Irish culture. This is very confusing. For example, social work is administered through the health boards and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is involved in drugs programmes and other Justice projects. If the health boards had to depend on various Departments for help their work in this area would not be as focused.</P>
    <P>The funding aspect should be closely looked at. It would be better for all concerned, especially for those applying, if funding was concentrated in the Minister's Department. In this context the question of benchmarking needs to be reconsidered. I understand the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform may consider allocating £50,000 to a project while the Department of Health and Children may value the project at £70,000 and the Minister's Department may value it at £20,000. There appears to be no uniform benchmarking in terms of evaluating specific projects. In addition there appears to be an absence of proper research and evaluation of projects, where different systems appear to operate within <Col N="1032" /> Departments. There also appears to be an absence of co-ordination within Departments. For example, there appears to be no recognised definition of what is meant by youth work, never mind how it should be funded.</P>
    <P>In the past professional youth workers have been employed by the various national organisations. They are committed and dedicated people. However, I understand there are no salary scales covering them, they have no pension scheme and there appears to be little security attached to the work. Most people take up such work at a young age and as they get older it may become more difficult for them to continue with it. The necessity to interact with children, etc., means the job becomes more pressurised with age. There is a need to clarify the position regarding the status of youth workers, including their terms and conditions of employment, pension rights and so on.</P>
    <P>Youth workers are very good, enthusiastic people. They are targeted by the partnership boards and the Leader programmes. They have available to them a number of alternative forms of employment which were not previously on offer. As a result youth organisations are finding it very difficult to hold on to them. If the job is not secure and there are no incentives to continue with it the youth services will lose very important core workers.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources I established a committee &ndash; the national youth advisory task force &ndash; to draw up a policy on rural development. All its recommendations were contained without acknowledgement in the White Paper published by the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Davern. I pointed this out in the debate on the youth services Bill. A key recommendation in the task force report was the need for rural proofing of all Government policies on rural areas. The same should apply to youth work. This would ensure that young people would not be deprived of this invaluable part of their education and lose out accordingly.</P>
    <P>In a press release the National Youth Federation questioned &ldquo;the futile exercise of tabling the Youth Work Bill, 2000, in Dáil Éireann while the recent Book of Estimates had indicated no additional resources for implementing the Bill.&rdquo;  That is a justifiable concern. The chief executive of the federation, Mr. Tony Murphy, stated that despite the unacceptable delay of almost three years in tabling the Bill, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science with responsibility for Youth Affairs, Deputy O'Dea, was introducing it merely as a PR exercise, having failed to obtain the additional funding required to deliver on all aspects of the Bill. According to Mr. Murphy, the recently published Book of Estimates had indicated an 8% increase in youth services spending for 2001, which in all probability would not even cover the obligations under the PPF and other cost of living increases. Mr. Murphy went on to state:</P>
    <P>At a time when youth organisations are con<Col N="1033" /> tributing to a new national youth work development plan and preparing themselves for major changes in the future delivery of youth work in Ireland, the lack of action by the Minister was proving to be a demoralising force for youth services and the tens of thousands of volunteers working with young people in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to respond to this because ultimately, the issue will come down to funding.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new role for the vocational education committees in youth work. I also welcome the proposal to include youth work under the umbrella of State care. In the past it was very haphazard and depended on the energy and leadership of local people. The Kerry Diocesan Youth Service was exemplary in the sense that this was regarded as the way to do things in the remainder of the country. Kerry was fortunate because other counties did not have the same leadership or impetus.</P>
    <P>I welcome the role of the vocational education committees in ensuring the provisions of the Bill will be implemented. The Bill I introduced included the whole issue of the evaluation of youth work. I welcome the role of the assessor, which will be important, because there is a lot of confusion in relation to what is defined as youth work. No doubt the assessor will be able to clarify what is quality youth work and what constitutes youth work and youth services. I presume the playing of billiards, snooker and so on forms part of youth work. Given the large contribution made by the Government to snooker, it might be more acceptable if those involved in youth work received a similar contribution to promote snooker within youth clubs.</P>
    <P>There is the whole issue of contracting programmes and services to other agencies, including a provision whereby vocational education committees can contract programmes and services in certain areas. Who will provide the services afterwards, what criteria are set down to ensure those providing them are adequately qualified and so on needs to be clarified. The national youth work advisory committee was the core issue in my 1991 Bill which, unfortunately, was rejected by the Government at the time. I believe that provision should have been put in place. It is very important that that advisory committee is as representative as possible. I am pleased the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation is now involved because this was not the case in the past.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is a very positive move. It will help to provide a proper framework for youth services throughout the country. The Minister of State must ensure that it is properly funded and that it will gather its own momentum through the provision of adequate funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak in support of the Youth Work Bill, 2000. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and the Government for introd<Col N="1034" /> ucing this very important and enlightened legislation.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Deenihan that there is an absolute need to ensure the whole area is rural proofed as well as gender proofed. In her contribution some weeks ago, Deputy Coughlan highlighted the need for rural proofing. Far too often the national media and Members who represent urban areas give the impression that disadvantage is confined to large urban centres. That is not the case because, unfortunately, throughout rural Ireland there are many disadvantaged young people. I hope the Minister, together with his officials in the Department and the various committees, will ensure that there is an adequate and proper spread of facilities.</P>
      <P>The legislation is very enlightened and farseeing. It reflects the Government's commitment to the vital area of youth training and the contribution this makes to the development of our society in general. The youth of today, as in the case of previous generations, will have a very heavy responsibility to bear in the future as they will be the decision makers of tomorrow, those who must ensure the norms of decency and responsible behaviour upon which civilised society is based are consolidated. The legislation is very important because it recognises the important role that has been played, is being played now and will be played long into the future by the voluntary sector.</P>
      <P>When introducing the Bill, the Minister referred to the whole idea of volunteerism. Government and statutory agencies can only do so much. Unless there is a willingness to recognise the vital role of the voluntary sector in this area, or indeed in any area associated with educational training, any legislative enactments are destined to remain platitudes. One of the ways the voluntary sector is being recognised is through involvement in day-to-day decision-making and in the formation and implementation of policy. As the previous speaker said, this is not the first legislation to be enacted in connection with youth work. The earlier Act was passed at a time when the establishment of education boards was being considered. Fortunately, this Government in its wisdom, through the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, abandoned that legislation which proposed the establishment of regional education boards. The rainbow Government was very foolish to try to establish such structures. This was unfortunate because for more than a year the whole area of local democracy and the important role of the vocational education committees was being undermined by the then Minister for Education's proposals to abolish vocational education committees, establish regional education boards and, in effect, deny public representatives their proper role in the formulation and implementation of education policy at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, in this country, particularly at official level, and to some extent at political level, <Col N="1035" /> there has been far too much emphasis on trying to sideline the role of local public representatives in the establishment of different boards at local level. I have stated clearly on many occasions in this House my opposition to particular sections of Bills and particular clauses that would deny public representatives the right to membership of some bodies. It is absolutely wrong that people who go before the electorate can be denied in legislation the right to sit on particular bodies, bodies that are being funded through the Exchequer following the passing of legislation in this House. Far too often throughout the country, particularly in recent years, self-appointed people are put on pedestals in relation to different activities. The time has come when legislation for the future must not build in clauses that will deny people who hold public office through the wishes of the electorate the right to membership of particular bodies. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who has always worked very well with public representatives and with the voluntary sector, will ensure that will not happen in the future.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, the regional education boards that were proposed by the rainbow Government were not established. It also became clear that the original legislation had additional shortcomings. They might have been addressed through a plethora of amendments. Instead this Government, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and his officials in the Department grasped the nettle and addressed these issues. Rather than allow the provisions of the earlier Act to go by default and lie on the legislative shelf, so to speak, this Government seized the opportunity to draft completely new legislation, which addresses the needs of youth workers in Ireland, to initiate a framework and a set of workable structures within which to operate.</P>
    <P>The Bill is comprehensive and well thought out legislation. It aims to provide solutions to many of the concerns and difficulties that those working in this important area have brought to the Government's attention, and indeed to the attention of Governments over many years. Prior to drafting the Bill, the Minister had a long process of consultation with interested parties. This was not a public relations exercise but a worthwhile attempt to learn which added to the Bill's value.</P>
    <P>An important element of youth work is that the participation of young people themselves is voluntary. No one, whether parents or former teachers, compels them to take part. There is positive peer pressure to the effect that youth work is not only fun but also useful. Few people who have been involved say that it was a waste of time.</P>
    <P>It is important that the role of youth training be seen within the scope of education. We all accept that education should not be confined to the classroom or lecture hall. It is centred on learning and only stops when we are no longer willing or able to learn. Often the most important <Col N="1036" /> lessons are learned in informal settings. Youth work teaches people about themselves and helps them decide what they want from life. Sometimes they have not previously had the opportunity or the incentive to ask the right questions.</P>
    <P>Youth training should not be seen as an alternative to formal education but as complementary. There many instances of people involved in youth work programmes who decided to return to formal education. The experience, self assurance and self knowledge gained in youth work makes them more successful.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to give a greater role to local voluntary education committees is welcomed. There are many bodies involved in formulating youth work objectives. All of them do valuable work operating on a voluntary, or almost voluntary, basis.</P>
    <P>One thing missing is co-ordination. It is regrettable that two or three organisations pursue the same goals, with inadequate resources. This legislation provides for co-ordination through the appointment of a national assessor of youth work, who will advise those working in this area. The national assessor will also act as the spokesperson for the various elements. Fear has been expressed about the withdrawal of departmental recognition without the parties concerned being able to state their case. The assessor will have a role in ensuring that all interests are considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister will remain the biggest single source of finance. He will continue to have a constructive role, such as initiating the research which is vital to any policy. He will also ensure that policy pursued in relation to youth work dovetails with other policy objectives, such as improved access to information.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to social inclusion and the removal of impediments that prevent everyone making a meaningful contribution to society. Therefore, there is special provision for youth work schemes in socially or economically disadvantaged areas. These areas are not restricted only to large urban centres.</P>
    <P>Already the Government is providing funds for projects and youth clubs in such areas. I want to see the disbursement of funds from the youth section of the Department to a wider area of the country, in particular the Border region and counties Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to the provision of a youth information service. Today, information is the best asset. Every area will have an information centre where young people can avail of information on job opportunities, career development and personal entitlements.</P>
    <P>The legislation will extend the duties and membership of the National Youth Advisory Committee. Since its creation three years ago, it has provided advice and will continue to advise those wishing to organise youth work properly. Its knowledge will be especially useful to bodies with little experience. The partnership aspects of the Bill are not platitudes as the Committee will draw half its membership from the voluntary sector. <Col N="1037" /> The inclusion of a senior official of the Department of Education demonstrates that it is aware of the need for youth work and formal education to develop together.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the implementation of policy rests with the vocational education committees. They have decades of experience in providing technical and adult education throughout their statutory areas. They also have expertise in youth work and their role should be enhanced. The vocational education committees will have their own youth work committees with significant voluntary representation.</P>
    <P>Each VEC will draft a three year plan. They are best placed to take into account local conditions. The Minister, as the source of funding, will continue to monitor the spending of money. He may also intervene where two or more neighbouring committees are pursuing projects which may be better tackled jointly.</P>
    <P>The provision of youth work programmes always had a strong voluntary involvement, especially at local level. Long may this continue. We all know of various youth committees and Foróige clubs in our own areas and the great enjoyment derived from participation in them. These involve people in projects such as caring for the elderly or raising awareness of the need to protect the environment. Over the years Foróige and other clubs have contributed significantly to the development of young people.</P>
    <P>The role of voluntary youth work committees at local level will be recognised and enhanced through this legislation. Many local voluntary youth work committees will be established which will work hand in hand with the local vocational committees in providing youth work programmes. I am glad the Minister has provided in the legislation that the voluntary sector must comprise at least 75% of the membership of each of these committees and also that our youth for whom these services are provided comprise at least a fifth of the membership.</P>
    <P>With any legislation we can talk of the structures that are being put in place. The skeleton can be sketched. Behind the structures being established to this legislation there is strong commitment to strengthen and consolidate this valuable sector in our nation's life and to ensure that there is effective co-ordination in the pursuit of its aims.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and his officials on bringing forward this very important legislation. It gives a co-ordinated and futuristic outlook to the whole area of youth services and their development, emphasising the need to have services spread throughout the entire country.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Boylan, Senator Leonard and myself have pursued for some time the need to provide funding towards the development of the major centre at Castle Saunderson in Cavan and Fermanagh. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, and some of his senior officials met a deputation some months ago from <Col N="1038" /> the scouting association of Ireland. The analysis and work undertaken in bringing the project to its present stage could not but have impressed them. I also compliment the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, who visited Castle Saunderson last June or July following a meeting with the scouting association.</P>
    <P>We know it will be a very expensive project. It will need substantial public funding. The Irish scouting association have been fortunate in being able to raise substantial funds, particularly in the United States. The location and the old castle are ideally suited to the project. It is one of the few places in Ireland where you could put either Cavan or Fermanagh on the address and it would be delivered by either An Post or the mail system in the North. Castle Saunderson fits the bill for a true cross-Border project. It would provide a facility for children North and South and from abroad for recreational and sporting activity.</P>
    <P>Having visited the project some time ago I compliment the work of the project director Mr. Bernard O'Connor from Enniskillen. He enlisted the help of all the local Oireachtas Members and local statutory agencies and has ongoing contact with a number of different Government Departments.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and his officials will travel to Cavan and Fermanagh to see the project and its possibilities at first hand. They will be assured of traditional Cavan hospitality. He will see that the Castle Saunderson project meets the criteria for the development of a major national centre for the scouting association and can assure himself of the justification for funding. The centre will be able to host international events and will serve children North and South throughout the year. We intend to pursue funding for this centre that offers so much potential.</P>

      <P>I support the case made for the project by Deputy Smith and Deputy Boylan and hope the funding required will be supplied.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. A disadvantage is that we do not know the actual funding the Government will give to the vocational education committees to administer it. We are at a crossroads with the youth of Ireland. Now more than ever we need volunteers to assist them. Never before have we had such temptation in relation to drink and drugs or so few young people involved in sport and activity. That cannot be good for society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Westport United soccer club, the oldest soccer club in Connacht, had to call off the AGM last week because they could not get officers to take up positions. The situation is alarming. Councillor Gerry Coyle, a man involved in boxing, has found <Col N="1039" /> the same problem. It is difficult to get the young involved, difficult to get people to volunteer assistance and those involved feel they have been let down by the State. It seems support is not there for them, particularly in disadvantaged rural areas like Geesala where they have got nothing but some gaeltacht funding for a hall. Yet we wonder why our youth have gone astray.</P>
    <P>In a recent report related to drink consumption Ireland was second highest in relation to youth drinking. Something must be done about this.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because through the vocational education committees local people will be involved and they will know what is going on in their communities. It is important that funding is made available not for the big projects but for the small clubs that are working for our youth.</P>
    <P>A local Westport man, Martin Keane, has been involved with the youth for over 20 years. He takes children out for the day, to the cinema, swimming and tries to get them playing football. At Christmas he had a very successful toy appeal. He does great work but has a major problem because he has no meeting hall. Any meeting or get together he organises must take place in a pub.</P>
    <P>I hope now that something will be done as regards facilities. I mention particularly facilities financed by the State. Sporting facilities and halls in schools and vocational education committees should be made available for youth groups. Whatever funding is needed for insurance should be provided by the Government. The safety aspects should be taken into consideration. Public facilities should be available so that it is not necessary to bring young people into pubs, hotels or unsuitable venues.</P>
    <P>There are many people doing good work who find it very difficult to recruit extra volunteers. We are at a crossroads. Serious problems exist with drink, drugs and violence. Reported cases are more vicious and violent. We must support people like Martin Keane, Gerry Coyle and others working with young people. They must be shown that there is more to life than drink and drugs.</P>
    <P>Disadvantaged areas are discussed at county council meetings, health board meetings and VEC meetings. They never seem to get the support and the funding that is their due. They are not as well organised as the golf clubs, the sailing clubs, or as was evident yesterday, the snooker federation. Golf clubs and the like are well organised and seem to have no difficulty in obtaining funding. Voluntary groups in rural disadvantaged areas should be supported in their applications for funding. The VEC should adopt a hands-on approach to disadvantaged areas, working with them and offering support. This Bill must ensure that funds will be available to projects in these areas.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday, Team Longnecks from Ballina played in the basketball national finals. Ballina has two basketball teams. They are both good <Col N="1040" /> enough to play in the premier division of the national league but they do not have a suitable venue as required by the championship. The National Lottery has provided money but there is a shortfall of perhaps £350,000. This organisation should be assisted because it helps keep young people in Ballina off the streets.</P>
    <P>Ballina is an area of high unemployment and yet the same contribution is expected as from the more well-off in golf clubs. I have nothing against golf &ndash; there are a lot of golfers in this House &ndash; but the disadvantaged should be favoured before those who can fight for themselves.</P>
    <P>Local youth organisations must be helped. The VEC is often regarded as the poor relation in education. I was educated in the vocational sector. Parents today want their children to become professionals such as doctors and solicitors. There is a shortage of carpenters and mechanics. It is now impossible to find a tradesman.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it will address the needs of people involved in the voluntary sector. The VEC sector has now been given the powers. I hope it will receive the funding to do a good job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill, which contains proposals I have advocated for many years. A structure must be put in place to help disadvantaged young people. The vocational education committees will be successful once funding is provided. The Bill alone will not be sufficient. Many voluntary organisations working with disadvantaged young people are starved of cash.</P>
      <P>People can be out of work for decades if they do not get a start when young. A rising tide does not lift all boats and some young people are excluded from mainstream employment. It is good for people to work, make friends and develop interests. We must target young people from disadvantaged homes. It is a pity to see young able-bodied people standing at street corners in towns and villages during the day rather than attending college or working. Skills in carpentry, bricklaying and horticulture are in short supply. Good training programmes will make people employable.</P>
      <P>I have always been a supporter of the vocational education system. It has served the people well. The VEC college in Cavan town has been developed into the College of Further Studies and young people now have access to previously unavailable third level education. I ask the Minister to consider a green-field development for this college. There are over 400 students attending and the buildings are spread around Cavan town. A proper location is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Castle Saunderson project was mentioned by Deputy Brendan Smith and supported by Deputy Michael Ring. This is an excellent project, an example of what can be done by voluntary effort and initiative. It is a castle demesne, an estate of 700 acres. More than 120 acres and the castle ruins are available for development. It is important to say that this demesne was pur<Col N="1041" /> chased by the all-Ireland scouting movement, North and South. The previous owners of the demesne are to be thanked for their generosity in selling the grounds for the sum of £300,000, a paltry amount by today's standards. The scouting movement is a cross-Border organisation and this project will become a national campus used by young people from the North and South and others who will become involved when the scouting movement establishes the national campus to which I refer.</P>
    <P>The national campus will allow young people from Northern Ireland, the Republic and mainland Europe to interact and get to know each other's views and outlooks. Given that it will be located on the Border, the campus will attract moneys from the peace initiative and funding from those in America who are friends of the scouting movement in Ireland and who have already contributed over £500,000. However, the Department will also be obliged to provide substantial support. In my opinion the development of this entire project will cost in the region of £10 million. That is not a large amount to pay, particularly in light of the current economic climate, for an initiative which will be of benefit to the entire country. I accept that the Border region will benefit immediately, but the scouting movement is a national organisation. This initiative will have a positive impact in the North and in the South and will help to bring about better understanding.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Brendan Smith in respect of this matter. All of those involved in politics in the region support the national campus project. I thank the Minister of State for visiting the site on which it is proposed to build the campus.</P>
    <P>I return now to the vocational education system which will be responsible for operating the voluntary committees. I am aware of committees that are trying to work with young people, boys and girls, and have attempted to establish needlework and art classes. However, they are finding it difficult to proceed with their work because of the scarcity of funding.</P>
    <P>Secondary school teachers are currently campaigning for wage increases, and rightly so because they are not that well treated. I have heard it said that teachers have a short working day because school finishes at 5 p.m. I know many teachers who work in a voluntary capacity with local organisations that are concerned about young people and want to give them an initiative to become involved in the mainstream of working life. These organisations meet in rooms which are also provided on a voluntary basis. Voluntary help can only be relied on to a certain extent, because it cannot be built upon if financial support is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>With voluntary work there is also the question of who is held responsible if an accident occurs. In that context, insurance is vitally important. Unfortunate accidents have taken place and the people who took responsibility for organising the classes to which I refer were held libel. As a result <Col N="1042" /> of the cost of defending libel actions and the awards involved, people are afraid to become involved in voluntary work unless they have insurance cover.</P>
    <P>We must not ignore the people who are already involved in voluntary work. We are establishing an entirely new system and we must appreciate the work that has already been done. In addition, we must use the people who have been working in this sector for many years, ensure that they are included in the new schemes and given proper insurance cover and, if necessary, pay their expenses. If this is done, I guarantee that the people to whom I refer will respond positively.</P>
    <P>I wish now to refer to the question of night life. Young people can be easily influenced by certain types of television programmes that are being broadcast at present. If parents are not alert their children may become involved with the drink and drugs culture. I accept that it is not easy for some couples because both partners are obliged to work in order to pay their mortgage and that their children return home from school to empty houses and are prey to particular temptations. If there is no one present to monitor their activities, these children can be lured into the wrong company and their lives can be destroyed. This usually happens to young teenagers who have not yet gained the understanding that comes with adulthood.</P>
    <P>The Youth Work Bill and those responsible for implementing its provisions can do a great deal of good, particularly in terms of saving the State a great deal of difficulty in dealing with the people to whom I refer who, for lack of proper direction, may not have the opportunity to develop in the way they want to. These people may go astray because they feel nobody cares or understands or is prepared to encourage them.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill. I do not doubt that the Minister of State will make a great success of it. I assure him that he will have my support and that of others on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide a legal framework for the provision by the Government of a youth work programme and services in vocational education committees and I commend the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal features of the Bill are the definition of the function of the Government regarding the provision of youth work &ndash; this includes the development and co-ordination of youth work programmes and services, research monitoring and the assessment of programmes and services in youth work &ndash; and the definition of the functions of vocational education committees regarding youth work &ndash; these include the preparation <Col N="1043" /> and implementation of youth work development plans for each VEC area, the drafting of annual youth work budgets for each VEC area and the reporting of youth work services in each area to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Before discussing the provisions of the Bill in detail, I wish to make a number of comments regarding the Government's policies on developing youth services in Ireland. One of the core aspects of the Government's national development plan for the period 2000 to 2006 relates to the comprehensive development of youth services. The European Commission has approved the elements of the national development plan regarding the promotion of educational opportunities for young people. Lack of educational achievement and self-esteem are key factors leading to unemployment, crime and social deprivation. Low educational achievement means that people lack the skills necessary to access the employment market and the capacity to avail of opportunities for further skills training. This is a particular problem in today's increasingly sophisticated employment market where skill redundancy is accelerating. Inevitable lack of skills leading to economic deprivation has knock-on implications for the community at large in that it can result in addiction, homelessness and criminal behaviour.</P>
    <P>To support the personal and social development of young people in order to prevent them drifting into substance abuse, unemployment and crime, £300 million will be spent on the following proposals: funding for the national youth work programme organisation to finance projects designed to develop young people as effective members of their communities; the provision of youth information centres to provide easy access to information on youth services and welfare; the provision of funding for the young person's facilities and services fund to support the development of youth facilities and services in disadvantaged areas experiencing or at risk of experiencing significant drug problems; funding for special projects for disadvantaged youth aimed at facilitating the development and social education of young people at risk of drug abuse, juvenile crime, homelessness, early school leaving and marginalisation; the establishment of early intervention programmes and substances abuse awareness programmes for young people who are at risk of early school leaving or who have low educational achievements and the establishment of a number of projects in urban and rural areas under the Garda youth prevention programme which aims, through intervention and prevention, to divert young people away from criminal activities. These are core elements to the Government's policy platform to develop comprehensive youth services in Ireland. In fact, the Youth Work Bill is part of the overall Government strategy in this regard. I will now analyse some key provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 9(2), the Minister, on the advice <Col N="1044" /> of the national youth work advisory committee, will draw up guidelines for the vocational education committees. Among the vocational education committees' functions will be the requirement to ensure the provision of youth work programmes and services in their areas. They may do so by providing financial assistance to approved national voluntary youth work organisations, designated local youth work organisations and authorised organisations subject to terms and conditions. There will be a particular focus on the youth work needs of those aged ten to 20 and who are socially and economically disadvantaged. Youth work development plans will also be prepared for each VEC area. If a VEC is of the opinion that a particular youth work service or programme is required but is not being provided, it may advertise to invite proposals from appropriate organisations.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill concerns the preparation of youth work development plans. Each VEC, in consultation with its youth work committee, will prepare a youth work development plan every three years to be submitted to the Minister for approval. The plan will specify the youth work requirements for the VEC area with particular regard to the needs of disadvantaged youths. Estimates of income and expenditure for each financial year will also be provided. Where required, the Minister may also allow for a supplementary youth work programme to be provided in a VEC area by an approved national voluntary youth work organisation, authorised organisation or designated local voluntary youth work organisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also empowered to appoint a youth work assessor. The assessor will have two principal functions, namely, the assessment and monitoring, on behalf of the Minister, of youth work programmes and services in receipt of funding under the Bill and a review of functions relating to the Minister of a VEC's administration of various youth work programmes and services. The assessor's duty will include the annual monitoring of youth work programmes and an assessment will take place once every three years.</P>
    <P>The national youth work advisory committee will also advise the Minister on the provision and co-ordination of youth work, youth work policies, the co-ordination of youth work with formal education, the co-ordination of youth work with other services for young people, gender balance in the provision of youth work, criteria for the approval or designation of national or local youth work organisations and the provision of guidelines for the voluntary youth council. Membership of the national youth work advisory council will be between 27 and 29 members. The membership of the committee will comprise representatives of the Irish Vocational Education Association, key Departments and other interested parties directly involved in youth affairs.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill each VEC will be legally obliged to establish a youth work committee which will make recommendations to the VEC on the exer<Col N="1045" /> cise of its youth work functions. Youth work committees will advise vocational education committees and comprise between ten and 20 members. As far as is practicable, a minimum of 75% of the members should be volunteers and where a professional youth worker is elected he or she should work in the VEC area concerned. At least one fifth of the members should be under 25 and regard is to be had to the desirability of representations from Traveller groups.</P>
    <P>Each VEC will also be empowered to designate a voluntary youth work programme, service or organisation which operates in its area as a designated local voluntary youth work organisation for the purposes of the Bill. The Minister may also make grants available to vocational education committees or the various youth work organisations for the purposes of the Bill. Any VEC or organisation in receipt of funds must keep proper accounts which must be submitted annually.</P>
    <P>There has been substantial economic progress in this country in recent years. However, key challenges facing legislators concern the need to ensure that social problems are tackled head on. All young people must be given the same opportunities to enter the education system and those who suffer from lack of educational achievement, low self-esteem, unemployment or who have been engaged in criminal activity must be helped at every turn.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I welcome the £300 million allocated under the national development plan for the development of youth services. I also welcome the key provisions of the Youth Work Bill which I and the Opposition support. I commend the Minister of State for introducing this important legislation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I thank Deputy Collins for sharing time. I welcome this Bill. The Minister of State has shown urgency in the introduction of the Youth Work Bill and it is important that it be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Youth Work Bill, 2000, gives youth work a legislative base for the first time and names the Minister for Education and Science as the Minister with responsibility for this area. This recognition of the educational role of youth work is very valuable.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger is roaring and the modern Ireland is a country of prosperity which is the envy of Europe. However, many problems remain, particularly among young people. We still have problems regarding early school leavers, drug and alcohol abuse and an alarming suicide rate, particularly among young males. What are the Government and Ministers doing to deal with this problem which is of major concern to all communities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Minister considers rural Ireland as well as our cities. All of the problems I have mentioned are now found throughout rural Ireland. I have no problem with the fact that so much money is being allocated to dealing with drug abuse in major cities as that problem must <Col N="1046" /> be dealt with. However, rural Ireland tends to be forgotten and neglected in this regard. Many towns are now experiencing serious drug problems with which the Garda is trying to deal. This is leading to problems within families and violent crime which we have not experienced in the past.</P>
    <P>Alcohol abuse in another major problem. As the Celtic tiger continues to roar young people have more money in their pockets which is being spent at weekends and alcohol abuse is becoming a very serious matter. People in small towns such as Enniscorthy in which I live, are concerned about the level of violence at weekends. This is particularly the case late at night when discos close and people congregate at chip shops which remain open until 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. More often than not someone is badly beaten up or there is violence at such locations. This problem was not common in rural Ireland in the past but has emerged in the past few years. There is a need for weekend Garda patrols and community action to deal with this problem. Tonight I will attend a meeting in Enniscorthy organised by the parents of children who have been attacked. Alcohol abuse is a serious problem which needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. It is important to consolidate youth work, youth involvement and all the energies which go into dealing with the problems of young people into one Bill. I welcome the fact the vocational education committees will be involved as their members work on the ground and know the situation regarding young people. They are also the people who will deliver the service. The VEC structure has provided a great service for young people and parents. I hope the Minister of State will give vocational education committees a major role and that there will be little interference from the Department or the Minister's office so vocational education committees will be able to reflect the needs of each county. There is no doubt that each county has its own youth work and involvement needs.</P>
    <P>There are many quangos in almost every county including county enterprise boards, area partnerships and Leader groups. Will there be any co-ordination with these groups and FÁS which trains young people? We must avoid over-bureaucracy and I hope these groups will come together to help provide youth services.</P>
    <P>I also wish to inquire about national organisations such as those involving GAA, soccer, rugby and the scouts which have provided a tremendous service for many years with very little recognition from the State. I am involved in the GAA and I speak for my own club, which has 18 teams &ndash; hurling, football and camogie &ndash; ranging from age eight to 18. They deal with approximately 400 young people every year. They take them off the streets, train them and through youth clubs provide them with facilities in the summer and winter. They are involved in matches, learn about discipline and other areas, yet those involved get very little recognition from the State for their input. Ready made volunteers <Col N="1047" /> are involved in such organisations working with young people. The Minister of State should take account of the experience gained by such volunteers, mentors and people involved with young people over the years and involve them in their structures, be it at VEC or whatever other advisory levels will be involved.</P>
    <P>The volunteer role is very important. Were it not for the number of people who work with young people on a voluntary basis, there would be major difficulties in dealing with young people throughout the country. I wish to refer particularly to the Ferns Diocesan Youth Service. It has served the young people of Wexford for almost 40 years. At its core, it is a voluntary organisation. The paid professional sector has grown in recent years to provide a better service in the modern world, but the voluntary aspect of the Ferns Diocesan Youth Service is very much at the heart of providing that service. Because those involved are dedicated to the principles of the Ferns diocesan youth, a vast army of volunteers, including professional people, put in hours of work that could not be remunerated. They give freely of their time, energy, patience and knowledge to make the lives of young people better and to make Wexford a better place to live. The Ferns Diocesan Youth Service has 36 youth clubs, 253 voluntary leaders and 1,300 members. It members answered approximately 9,000 queries in 1999. The service has 279 people participating in three training projects and it has many other projects around the county. It employs 22 full-time staff and 37 trainee workers. It has many different areas of involvement and it is important that its work continues to be recognised.</P>
    <P>The service requires extra funding for drop-in information centres. It has one in Wexford town and it is seeking approval for a drop-in centres in New Ross and Enniscorthy, the proposals for which are currently before the Department. I hope the Minister of State will seriously consider approving those proposals as the centre in Wexford provides an tremendously helpful service to the young people there. It is only right that young people should have access to a similar facility in New Ross, Enniscorthy and Gorey. The centre is running youth projects but it has only one worker per project. When dealing with young people aged seven to 18, it is necessary to have at least two workers to run a proper project.</P>
    <P>The centre requires multi-annual funding as opposed to the current position of yearly funding. It has to wait literally until the last minute to get funding approval. The Minister is probably examining this area. The centre requires three year funding to enable it to plan ahead. A number of speakers mentioned the need for three year funding for youth clubs operating in different counties. I ask the Minister of State to seriously consider this matter.</P>
    <P>The Ferns Diocesan Youth Service is also setting up after school support groups for seven to nine year olds. It has applied for funding to the <Col N="1048" /> Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and perhaps the Minister of State could ascertain from his ministerial colleague if funding for such groups can be approved, given that it is a very worthwhile project for disadvantaged children. That project will commence initially in Wexford town and it will be expanded to other towns in the country. In a major town such as Wexford town, which has many disadvantaged areas, and is expanding all the time, it is important that after school support groups should be given adequate funding and that they should be set up as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which, when enacted, will help to improve youth services in every county. Many Bills are passed in this House and then it transpires that securing the necessary funding to implement their provisions is a major problem. It is important that the Minister of State seriously considers ensuring the provision of adequate funding to implement the provisions of this Bill. There is no point in passing this Bill, which is supported by all sides of the House, unless the necessary funding to implement its provisions is passed on to the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I hope there will not be too much interference with vocational education committees when they get their programmes up and running. I notice that everything has to be approved by the Department. It would be a matter of concern if the length of time taken to approve projects in the past is anything to go by. The Minister for Education and Science visited Wexford last July and announced that a third level facility would be based in the old St. Peter's college, yet eight months later we are still awaiting the appointment of the directorate to provide those services. That is not good enough. I ask the Minister of State to check the position regarding that directorate. I hope there will not be that type of delay when this Bill is passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this very important Bill. It has been welcomed by my colleagues and they have dealt with much of the technical detail. This Bill will play a very important role in the social and personal development of our young people. The Minister of State said its aim is to assist all young people to realise their full potential and to become active participants in our democratic society. Youth projects and organisations provide the means by which that development can take place. He also went on to say that the central aspect of the youth work is a young person's voluntary participation in the services and he recognised the role of many adults and young leaders in that regard. This Bill is extremely important. As some of the backbenchers on the Government side said, the importance of the Bill is one matter, but ensuring adequate funding is provided to fund its provisions is another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people find it difficult to realise that constituencies such as Cavan-Monaghan, which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I represent, has one <Col N="1049" /> of the lowest levels of participation in third level education. There is a major need to provide for further services for young people who leave school early or come from severely disadvantaged backgrounds. Such disadvantaged backgrounds, especially in the Monaghan area, stem from the fact that many people came across the Border to set up home during the Troubles and did not avail of the opportunities that were available. Families split up and there are grave difficulties. One only has to visit some of the major housing schemes in Border towns to realise how great are those difficulties. We are lucky to have some of the necessary services, but there is a need for improvement.</P>
    <P>At a time when we have a Celtic tiger economy, it is difficult to explain to those people where the tiger can be found. We are at a serious disadvantage. As other speakers said, there is a good deal of drug abuse in my constituency and this is very serious in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of alcohol abuse. Recent figures that showed we have one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in Europe; this is not something of which we should be proud. Some of my colleagues questioned why the single biggest event here in recent years &ndash; the coming of President Clinton to say farewell to us and to get rightful recognition for what he had done for this island home of ours, North and South &ndash; was held in Guinness Brewery. I have nothing against Guinness, and we are proud in Ireland of our drinking tradition, but it sent out the wrong message, particularly as the Taoiseach ended up in a pub with President Clinton after that.</P>
    <P>We should look seriously at this. Anything we can do to keep young people away from drug and alcohol abuse is welcome. I know this is a health matter but it is worth stating that there are fewer facilities available to people with alcohol problems today than there were 25 years ago, according to a person in the health sector to whom I spoke recently. Given the amount of money the Exchequer is gathering from taxes on alcohol, that situation should be rectified. If 1% or 2% of people fall by the wayside with alcohol problems that cause difficulties for themselves or their families, we must recognise that and deal with in a compassionate manner. This is a serious illness and it would save health boards money in the long-term if they are given proper treatment.</P>
    <P>This Bill is linked to the vocational education committees and I reiterate what other speakers have said: we need to make sure there is absolute co-ordination here. We have many groups looking after different aspects of youth activity. FÁS does a good job with training and there are also Leader groups and other partnerships. It can be frustrating for me to deal with so many groups as a public representative but it must be even more frustrating for the ordinary person to know exactly where they should go for help or advice. We have more organisations than most in the Border region and while that is an advantage in some ways, it can lead to much activity from <Col N="1050" /> groups following an agenda of self-preservation. I hope there will be as much co-ordination here as possible.</P>
    <P>I have not read the Bill sufficiently to see how some of the provisions work with voluntary groups but recently there was a major confrontation with the Community Games organisation about the Mosney site. That site is less available now than it was and the problem was solved for this year but the involvement of parents and leaders in that organisation must be recognised. Most politicians are aware of that involvement but we must ensure such voluntary work is helped now and in the future. Soccer clubs, swimming clubs, GAA clubs and other groups have all done much voluntary work to ensure our youth is involved in worthwhile activities and that must be linked to this Bill because this is not just a matter of education. If young people are involved in sports and recreational activity rather than the other, less fruitful activities that we in the Border areas were more used to, then this Bill and the organisation it sets up can play a part. We should never forget church based bodies and associated youth clubs as they have played an enormously positive role in teaching young people about the Christian ethos and maintaining a proper structure for those young people.</P>
    <P>Regarding disadvantage, many rural areas have one remedial teacher covering three or four schools. I learned of a case recently where a remedial teacher was given a new and more specialised role dealing with younger children but that meant the group aged between 7 and 9 years were left out. The Minister of State has responsibility for that area and we must ensure that every possible help is given to those who need it at the earliest possible date. A remedial teacher covering a large number of schools can spend only a short period of time in each. In the example I have given from Scotshouse, there is no remedial education for individual children who need it because they fall into the wrong age group. That is wrong and must be rectified. I have written to the Department about this and I intend following it up. I do not speak negatively as this human issue should be dealt with in a non-political way.</P>
    <P>We have an outreach centre in my constituency organised by the VEC which deals with a lot of training and sports activities but the centre has not yet been recognised by the Department for funding. It is in areas like this that the Department has an opportunity to play a positive role and I ask the Minister of State to deal with this issue urgently. Another example of positive youth work in my constituency is the proposal to establish an all-Ireland scout centre at Castle Saunderson. The three Irish scouting bodies have come together and bought the site, which is a historic old castle with forests and water based activities right on the Border. The area was used by subversive organisations in the recent past so it is tremendous to see such a place being used positively: for example, it could get worldwide recognition for scout jamborees. I accept it will take a <Col N="1051" /> lot of money but we must recognise that for the first time ever the scouting bodies have come together across religious and political divides and have put a plan to unite both organisations in the South while working with the organisation in the North; the names of those involved have already been put on the record. Approximately 55,000 scouts are involved and when one adds in leaders and other staff this figure is increased to 70,000. This project can be of tremendous benefit for those people but, more importantly, with some imagination this centre could be used for all sorts of activities for the youth of this island. It can be made into a self-financing centre that could become a centre of excellence for both our youth and the youth of the world and might even replace Mosney for the Community Games.</P>
    <P>Insurance is still a worrying issue for many voluntary bodies and we should examine this problem. There is a mentality where people will take any opportunity to make a claim. People take the opportunity to make claims and, as a result of that claim mentality, Monaghan Urban District Council had to close the swimming pool in Monaghan because a piece of the roof fell off. It had a right to close the pool and I support its decision. However, it is an example of the problems that exist at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne from Wexford mentioned the issue of young people on the streets who are involved in various activities. This is why there is a need for Youthreach and proper accommodation for youth. These enable young people to get involved in positive activities. Cootehill Town Commissioners, in conjunction with a group there, brought together all the Oireachtas Members for the area and outlined the activities in which some groups are involved not only at night, but also in broad daylight. They outlined the damage done to people's property and many other issues. It is almost impossible for the Garda to keep control of these groups.</P>
    <P>Another problem involves young people disturbing elderly people in urban areas by going to late night chippers after they leave discos. Any action that would minimise that type of activity by encouraging young people to get involved in positive activities should be taken. This should involve the support of parents, voluntary leaders and others. This should be done and I would support the spending of whatever money is required in that regard. It would be a positive development and would save money and hardship in the long run. I have been contacted by people in towns such as Ballybay and Castleblaney about this matter. Recently the Garda in Castleblaney had to deal with serious trouble. In Clones, gardaí were recently beaten up late at night by youths.</P>
    <P>Parents can be blamed for not having more control over their children, but maintaining such control is not as practical now as it was 30 or 40 years ago because opportunities exist for young people. I welcome the Bill, but we must ensure that vocational education committees and others <Col N="1052" /> have sufficient funds to put into action the plans suggested by the Minister. I thank the Minister for introducing the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Daly.</P>
      <P>I welcome this debate on the Youth Work Bill, 2000, and many of its provisions. For the first time, youth work has been formally recognised by the Department of Education and Science. This work is most important and complementary to a young person's formal education and training and it is primarily done by voluntary youth work organisations. Undoubtedly, such voluntary groups have contributed to the complete development of young people throughout the country for many generations. It is timely that this work is recognised and funded adequately to enhance and improve the facilities available at such centres of youth work.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his innovative Bill, recommends that youth work should be co-ordinated nationally to include education programmes and that these joint ventures should be resourced. I concur with the comments of Deputy Browne from Wexford that while the passage of legislation is welcome, it is vital that resources and adequate funding are put in place. The Minister suggested that, to date, little research has been done on youth programmes and the services that are provided. In this respect, he recommends research and monitoring and assessment of youth programmes. Such information should be taken into account by the national youth work committee, which has special responsibility for adopting change and improving the current voluntary organisations and programmes that are available. The Minister stressed that disadvantaged children must be given priority and that gender balance in relation to allowing access to youth work must be fair.</P>
      <P>Researchers and people involved with adolescents know the benefits that arise when disadvantaged children become involved in youth work. It aids their social and psychological development to an enormous extent. In recent years a number of innovative groups set up programmes to aid disadvantaged children and these proved most successful. Many of these programmes are of a sporting nature and the benefit to the children involved is remarkable. It is time such groups were recognised in a more meaningful way and that resources were allocated to enhance their work for the undoubted betterment of society. Many of these groups have struggled on with low budgets. They will now receive proper funding and monitoring and the possibility of expanding such programmes will be investigated. New programmes will be designed in accordance with the rules set out. These new organisations will be co-ordinated and set up in locations that are in need and they will bring enormous benefits to local communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to work with vocational education committees. The Minister, in collaboration <Col N="1053" /> with the national youth work advisory committee, will draw up guidelines for vocational education committees to enable them fund youth work programmes in their areas. The local VEC will co-ordinate youth work services with the education services in the area. Each VEC will prepare a youth work development plan and it envisaged that the VEC will invite submissions or proposals from appropriate organisations to expand and improve the number and diversity of youth work in their areas. The Minister will be empowered to appoint an assessor of youth work. This person will assess and monitor the programmes and the VEC administration of various youth work projects and services.</P>
    <P>The new youth work advisory committee will have between 27 and 29 members from diverse backgrounds. The chairperson will have youth work experience and expertise and will be appointed by the Minister. Two officials of the Department of Education and Science will also be appointed. The national body for vocational education committees will nominate two members and Ministers from several relevant Departments will nominate a member. FÁS will nominate a member and the prescribed national youth work representative organisations will also nominate members. These people, who will be from diverse but relevant backgrounds, will form the basis of a board which will have expertise and progress important areas.</P>
    <P>Youth work committees will be appointed in each VEC area. This group will have between 12 and 20 members, which will include nominees from the VEC, FÁS, the health board, the Garda Síochána, the formal education sector and local government. This committee, made up of relevant people from the community, will lead to a practical enhancement of youth work in the VEC area concerned.</P>
    <P>It must be noted that this is the first time the Department of Education and Science has made a formal effort to co-ordinate with youth workers towards a common goal. Teachers and the education sector rely on this area and are aware of how such work helps the development and contentment of school children and adolescents. There is no doubt that students are in a much better frame of mind to receive a better education and develop in a more positive manner. The ultimate goal of education is to develop students in a progressive and articulate manner so they can cope with work and fit into society. The Bill goes a long way towards fulfilling that aim.</P>
    <P>It must also be noted that young people who are disadvantaged are the most in need in communities. These young people are most common among school leavers and they consequently end up on the long-term unemployed list because they are unable or not inclined to work. Many of them do not see the relevance of working. They are born into inner city or rural poverty traps and they find it difficult to fit into society. Many become involved in crime and drug abuse. As legislators, we must educate and develop young <Col N="1054" /> people to ensure they avoid such activities. We must find alternatives for these young people and ensure they value themselves. They must have an alternative to hanging around street corners, looking for trouble.</P>
    <P>Children who are bored get into trouble. The Bill advocates the establishment of youth groups for the enjoyment and development of young people so they can relate better to society and fit in. If that happens, it will be a good move. It will aid the work of the teacher in the classroom and the gardaí on the street. Above all, it will help the development of young people so they can make a vibrant contribution to society and in their lives. The Bill will not be put into place before vital research on the issue is examined.</P>
    <P>Let me examine some research on educational disadvantage and show how this Bill will be used in conjunction with the formal schooling to address this problem. Educational disadvantage is a complex phenomenon intrinsically linked to the economic, social and cultural practice which cannot be viewed in isolation from social exclusion, poverty and the inadequate experience of many communities in society. The process of becoming educationally disadvantaged is critical in that the education system can reproduce disadvantage, poverty and social exclusion. This occurs in a number of ways, through high participation costs, the over-dominance of middle class values, lack of resources and support structures, omission in streamlining policies and the making of decisions from on high with lack of consultation. Three out of four poor households are headed by persons with no qualification and a further 19% are headed by people with only junior cycle qualifications. In a recent report by the Traveller review body it was estimated that virtually all Travellers are illiterate, highlighting the failure of successive Governments in their approach to Traveller education. A number of reports have highlighted patterns of stereotyping in subject choices with low take-up by females in non-traditional subjects, resulting in constraints on later occupational choices, career paths and earnings.</P>
    <P>Let us not get carried away by the undoubtedly changing market environment which is resulting in increased demands for a more highly qualified labour force. Increased skill levels are serving to polarise those who are unqualified or who have inadequate qualifications. There is no place in society for young people who have not developed sufficiently or who are not educated enough to participate. This is where the role of the youth worker, in conjunction with the education system, must come into play. They must address this outstanding need and they must be encouraged and funded by those in power in order that the problem of young people being unemployable is addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency in recent reports reflects on the plight of the disadvantaged child. It recommends that one of the top three ways of addressing educational disadvantage is to develop partnerships and co-ordinate Government ser<Col N="1055" /> vices. This is exactly what the Bill recommends and it is a good step forward for future generations of young people.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum highlights the development of partnerships between parents, particularly stressing those from disadvantaged backgrounds, schools, youth organisations and other educational training agencies. It recommends collaboration between interdepartmental working groups with representatives from the Departments of Education and Science, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment and from FÁS. It recommends that young people will best be helped by ongoing co-ordination between all these people involved in their development.</P>
    <P>As I stated already, there are many beneficial youth groups working in the unrecorded centres throughout the country and this Bill sets out to help such centres. One such successful centre is Cashel and Emily Youth Services which endeavours to provide a safe environment in which young people are facilitated in responding to the diversity of developing needs through youth work programmes and events. This service works for mainstream and disadvantaged young people alike in an array of different settings but with a shared ethos throughout. The key to its success is that it involves many groups from the community, including the South Eastern Health Board, the social services, a local vocational school, Youthreach and many local youth services. Some of the benefits of it are that young people are being encouraged to stay on in education, having the experience of working in groups and of team-building, participating in programme design, increasing in self-confidence and developing skills. It also focuses on encouraging young people to reflect on life decisions and choices and on increasing social skills and ability to relate to peers and adults by improving communication skills.</P>
    <P>While this may seem aspirational, it is being achieved. This is not the only programme of its kind in Ireland. There are many such successful programmes but they can be improved by the provision of resources and by co-ordination as well as by further research. People working in such groups have given a great deal to young people in their areas and it is time they were helped and encouraged. This is the aim of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan for giving me the opportunity to say a few words about the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, on bringing forward this legislation and on the initiatives he has taken since he took up this office. He has introduced a number of innovative initiatives in this area which were long over<Col N="1056" /> due. He is setting down the foundations for the best framework for the development of youth services and facilities we have seen in Ireland for a long time. An amount of detailed discussion has gone into preparing this legislation and I compliment the Minister of State, his staff and the people who have been working on it for their detailed preparatory work. In the long-term, the Bill will put in place a framework on which we can build sound youth organisational management to develop the area.</P>
    <P>The Bill extends the remit of the vocational education committees and gives them the priority framework on which to build this new policy. This is an innovative way of doing this. In using the vocational committees, the Minister is using a well established framework mechanism to organise this new service. It is a very detailed service, which deals with issues such as the preparation of plans in local areas and the preparation of budgets, the provision of an overall scheme and co-ordination between the various organisations.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to some of the voluntary organisations which have been doing tremendous work in the area of youth services for some time. I single out for special mention Fr. Seán Sexton who, under the diocesan youth council of Clare, has done great work on a shoestring in this area over recent years. He has improved youth services in Ennis and west Clare in my constituency. With Fr. Pascal Hanrahan, he has done sterling work at a time when there was a gap in the State service provided. I would like to see recognition of their work. I am not sure what way this work is being done in other dioceses, but certainly the Clare diocesan youth personnel such as Fr. Seán Sexton have excelled not only in ensuring the facilities and framework in which these services can be provided but also in co-ordinating the work done to date, albeit in a haphazard way, by other voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>This legislation will offer the opportunity to develop the services in a planned and meaningful way. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has not only set down in the legislation the framework for the development plan and advisory committee but has provided for substantial funding to deal with this area, which is very important. One of the main priorities in the future for the development of services will be the maintenance and continuation of the funding so necessary to underpin the work of the organisations which will be so vital to ensure this policy works in future years.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the rural organisations and the difficulties they encounter in isolated areas in the provision of services for young people. Again I compliment the work done by Macra na Feirme in recent years. Macra na Feirme has tended to look more at the economic aspects of development rather than what they initially set out to do when it was founded as a farming related educational organisation.</P>
    <P>Many of us were involved in Macra na Feirme question time sessions, in its public debates and <Col N="1057" /> in the various activities in which it got involved. Nevertheless, there are many serious problems in rural areas as well as in the cities.</P>
    <P>Substantial funding made available in recent grant allocations is going to the disadvantaged in cities and in built-up areas. There are, however, problems in many of the rural areas as well. Many people are aware of the fact that, in many thriving provincial towns, there are problems of vandalism, of unprovoked attacks on people and problems similar to those witnessed in Dublin for the past ten or 15 years. These are beginning to be repeated and copied in some provincial towns, especially the most successful towns.</P>
    <P>Some say it is due to the lack of leisure and recreational youth facilities in this area. I am not sure it is. It is related to other matters and in some respects the difficulties were, at one time, associated with poverty, deprivation and the lack of opportunity. In some respects it is now not a poverty problem but a surplus of finances that is the cause of some of the problems, in many provincial towns anyway.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, important and timely that this legislation goes before the House to afford us the opportunity to underline, for the Minister, the necessity to put this framework in place and to monitor it carefully, as he is proposing in the legislation.</P>
    <P>Though I emphasise that we badly need this legislation and that it is timely, I do not want a massive bureaucracy established which will devour the finances needed to provide the services, amenities and facilities. Care should be taken that, when we put a framework in place, we do not build in too much organisation, expense and bureaucracy which would have less finances available for the work that needs to be done. That is part of the difficulty with this legislation.</P>
    <P>The committee is too big. How will the Minister get any decision from a 29 or 27 member advisory committee? It might be necessary to refine that to 15 or 12 people if he wants to get some quick decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to this Bill and I welcome it as important, timely and good. I congratulate the Minister for introducing it and his officials and anyone involved with it for working on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the International Year of the Volunteer and the volunteer is mentioned quite a number of times in this Bill. Sadly, however, people are now so busy working and so forth that it is getting harder and harder to attract volunteers, at every level, into voluntary organisations. Initially, therefore, I suggest to the Minister for State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, that we should have some way of recognising volunteers and the work they do in society. It is an idea we could discuss in this House, perhaps not now but at a later stage, even through this Bill. I do <Col N="1058" /> not know how we might to it but it is something worth discussing.</P>
    <P>Volunteers work at all levels in sporting, youth and social organisations helping younger, older and needy people and so on. I call on the Government to do something to recognise the volunteer this year.</P>
    <P>We have many awards systems, though I do not know if another award system is the way to proceed. I would like to see something that would encourage people to become volunteers. Perhaps there is some way to tease that out on this committee or in another forum. The Minister might establish a committee on volunteers and examine this area where we could encourage volunteers.</P>
    <P>There is, for instance, the Gaisce award, which encourages young people to get involved and they get an award from the President at the end, the President's Award. That is excellent. I recognise the work volunteers are doing at all levels of our society, in all organisations, and as individuals as well.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill but I am concerned, however, that in many areas young people are finding it difficult to socialise together outside school. The only place many young people can socialise is in the local hostelry, the public house. This is leading to an alcohol dominated culture among young people. If we are not careful we will build major problems for ourselves in years to come, problems associated with alcoholism, lack of physical fitness and the health problems that go with that.</P>
    <P>There are also issues to do with building relationships at a young age and the public house is not the place to do it. Very often, the opportunity does not arise in school to do it either, even though many laudable attempts are made. Youth services, youth clubs and youth work provide this opportunity for young people to socialise and to get to know each other in a healthy, possibly supervised, atmosphere. This could also be a freer, looser atmosphere than is found in schools.</P>
    <P>This is important. Youth organisations such as Foróige, for instance, formerly Macra na Tuaithe, have, through the years, done great work in that area. These youth organisations and youth clubs need places where young people can go to do youth work and to socialise. This is something that has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Youthwork is as important as the formal education area in schools and we should treat it with the same importance with which we treat formal education, as this is informal education. In the same way schools are provided for formal education, youth centres should be provided for this informal education. Perhaps many of our schools could double in function as many schools are closed from 3 p.m. or 4 p.m. I welcome the VEC involvement and we should incorporate some way that the facilities the schools have at the moment would be made available to the youth services in the evening and at night, as this is often when youth work is carried out.</P>
    <P>There may be issues to do with insurance, pro<Col N="1059" /> tection of property in schools or the way classrooms are laid out and with school equipment, as schools are formal places and youthwork is informal. However, if a youngster has a choice between going into an old, draughty hall with poor furniture, no music and second-hand facilities and going into a lounge bar where there is music and entertainment it is easy to see which choice they will make and why, very often. Youth clubs and the youth service should be financed, resourced and assisted to provide youth centres in towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have spoken about the need for and importance of providing youth work for those who are deprived. That is important and it is vital that it is done. It is as important that youth work be provided for young people who are not deprived. Very often, we find that youngsters in towns and in the countryside who are relatively well off also have nowhere to go in the evening and at night to socialise and to learn informally from their colleagues. This should be an all-encompassing approach by the Department and by the people involved in setting up a proper youth service in Ireland. Not only those who are deprived but also those who are well off need youth work and youth services.</P>
    <P>I welcome that the vocational education committees are involved because they have a great deal to offer. However, vocational education committees vary in size, from large to small. Some of them cover small towns whereas some, like the one in my county of Cork, cover a large area. It is a marvellous VEC but it covers a huge county. Perhaps we should examine the option of dividing up larger areas such as Cork because youth work is local as well as national.</P>
    <P>I welcome the manner in which the Minister has structured this. Voluntary youth councils feed into youth work committees and there are also assessors and the Minister. However, like my colleague, Deputy Daly, I am concerned about too much bureaucracy and committees that are too large. Although it is important to involve as many people as possible, I urge caution. Committees that are too large are unwieldy and it can be difficult to get decisions made.</P>
    <P>The voluntary youth councils are interesting and they will involve people at local level. The youth work committees are important and they mirror the ideas put forward by the home-school-community liaison programme whereby there would be an area network. This is a similar idea concerning youth work and it is already happening in many ways under the home-school-community liaison programme, so we must be careful to avoid duplication and having people do the same work under different headings.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination is mentioned in the Bill and this must be co-ordinated across the board. I am aware the Garda, health boards and local public health nurses will be involved and will have an input and that is very important. I also note that <Col N="1060" /> young people will be involved and it is vital that they be involved in decision making as well.</P>
    <P>The structure of youth organisations must be properly financed and we have the resources to do that now. I am sure we all agree that there is nothing more important in which to invest money. We must ensure the new structures are properly financed from day one. It is something we will watch carefully to ensure it is done and we will encourage that the money be provided at all levels.</P>
    <P>In my area the Cloyne Youth Federation does excellent work. I recognise the work of volunteers. I welcome the Bill and look forward to the debate on Committee and Report Stages and to seeing the aspirations of the Bill being put into practice. As soon as the Bill is passed, I would like to see action and activity. I would like to see young people at all levels throughout the country becoming involved in informal education and development and socialising, learning and doing things together to provide them with an alternative to the pub culture which, sadly, is becoming dominant.</P>
    <P>Although there is an overlap, I would like to see co-ordination between sporting organisations and the youth service. That is important because sporting organisations often link in with young people and do terrific work. I did not notice in the Bill that sporting organisations would have some link whereby they could make a contribution.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of the link between formal education and the youth services which will be set up. That is a welcome development. I encourage a home-school-community liaison officer being appointed to all schools. If not, one should be shared between a cluster of schools. That person could provide the link between the youth work service and the school at both primary and secondary levels.</P>
    <P>Another area on which we should focus and which is related to this area of youth work is Youthreach. It caters for youngsters who find the mainstream education system has failed them. They go to Youthreach and the outcome is often successful. I encourage the linking up of the youth service structure being established under the Bill and Youthreach. Youthreach must also be properly resourced and I am not convinced that is the case at present. I encourage the Government to ensure it is properly resourced and that the teachers, instructors and trainers in the scheme are catered for properly. My information is that they are often part-time and temporary.</P>
    <P>Above all else in Youthreach, and the same applies to the youth services, we should ensure those working within it are properly qualified because youth work is a professional service. It is as important as teaching. One must have skills and a certain amount of experience and training to work with young people at this level. I know some people have a natural ability but in this area and this era when volunteers find it increasingly <Col N="1061" /> difficult to give up their time, we need professional youth workers in the major centres. We have professional teachers in schools and we should have professional workers driving this forward. These youth workers must be properly paid, trained and catered for with a career structure in place for them. I did not see that mentioned in the Bill. Perhaps I missed it, but I am sure it is implicit in the intention of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The instructors, teachers and trainers must also be catered for and have a career structure and proper training. It is not good enough, although understandable, that one of these instructors, on obtaining a permanent job, leaves Youthreach to take up that position. Where does that leave the people they train in the scheme? It leaves them having to learn how to get on with a new instructor or trainer. Therefore, continuity is necessary and vital for both the youth services and Youthreach. If it is broken and lost because of movement of instructors and trainers, especially during the year, that is not the best position in which to find ourselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there will a national youth work advisory committee and that various Departments, such as Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Social, Community and Family Affairs, and so on, will be involved with it and will have an input to it. I am excited about this Bill because it is very good and has been well put together. It has brought together all the organisations, prescribed national youth organisations, voluntary groups, statutory agencies and so on, at different levels. Whoever put this together is to be commended.</P>
    <P>Obviously, no matter what Bill is brought forward or who brings it forward, one side or the other will find that improvements can be made. This is such an important area, it will merit careful consideration on Committee Stage. I see that a great deal of work has already been done on the Bill. The Minister is putting a structure in place to ring-fence moneys for youth work by providing for a youth work budget, in respect of which, given the vital need for accountability, he is putting accounting procedures in place. There is, however, a lack of detail as to what the budget will cover. In this context, it is vital that provision is made for youth centres, the actual structures in which young people can congregate together. Will the youth work budget stretch to their provision? While there are youth centres in many cities, towns and villages, many are in need of massive funds and upgrading to make them attractive, comfortable and conducive to the work that needs to be done. What kind of programmes will the various committees put in place for young people? I assume they will also be funded from the youth work budget. It will be interesting to see what kind of programmes are put in place.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of parents, whom I have not heard being mentioned, in the proposed structure should be looked at. It is possible that they have a role to play. Perhaps a way should be found to encourage them to become involved as volun<Col N="1062" /> teers in the youth service at local level. It is a criticism that they use sports and youth clubs as a babysitting service while they go off to the pub. I am sure we have all done this from time to time, but it would be useful if the incorporation of their views was provided for. It seems all other groups have been included in the proposed structure. I hope there is a role for parents to play.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through both Houses. I look forward to its implementation and seeing it in action. It is badly needed and should be properly funded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Member will welcome the Bill as it marks the first real attempt at consolidation for the various youth groups throughout the country. This is necessary in the times in which we live. We are all aware of the problems facing young people. It does not matter whether they are ten, 12, 14, 16, 18 or 20 years of age, they all face the same problems. They include peer pressure and social pressures of all descriptions, including drink and drugs.</P>
      <P>To my horror in this city yesterday I watched as a courier on a bicycle picked up drugs at a street corner, not one half mile from Leinster House, in broad daylight at 3.30 p.m. He then took off with mobile phone in hand. This frightened me. These are the individuals who are causing young people enormous problems. Our teenage children will tell us that they are very careful not to be in the company of certain individuals. They will never say why, but it is obvious that they have their reasons for telling us.</P>
      <P>In looking at youth work, one also has to look at the question of funding. Every Member will want to ensure adequate funds are provided for this project when it gets under way in earnest. There are between 20 and 30 registered voluntary groups, each of which is scratching for money. We have a duty and the resources to fund them properly. Under legislation a certain percentage of national lottery funds should be directed towards youth work and the provision of youth services. We will have to do this if we want to tackle the problems confronting us.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of facilities in urban and rural areas. I agree with Deputy Stanton that the local hostelry or pub has become the local meeting place. Twenty-five years ago it was the country hall, with a paraffin heater in the corner. Today, people have different expectations. They expect the same comforts that they enjoy at home. They do not want to end up in the corner of a windy hall frozen to bits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several levels to the disco scene. One has discos for 11 to 13 year olds and the school disco for 14 to 17 year olds. One also has the ordinary adult disco, most of which have a sign stat<Col N="1063" /> ing, &ldquo;Over 21s only&rdquo;. I often wonder how they judge age or ID. This indicates that there is categorisation of young people, which results in peer pressure.</P>
    <P>We owe a great debt of gratitude to the various voluntary organisations, including Foróige, Macra na Feirme and the Catholic Youth Council, for their efforts during the years. They are doing tremendous work with little or no resources. If we want to make this a better society for young people, we will have to ensure they have confidence in the individuals with whom they are dealing. In this context, given the horror stories we have heard during the years of young people being molested &ndash; such stories cause them to be frightened &ndash; there is a need for all voluntary groups to register their officers and membership and a need to maintain a register of all those who have been involved in the mistreatment of people, young or old. Such information should be made available on a confidential basis to the Garda authorities which, in turn, should make it available to the various bodies concerned to ensure the protection of young people, as much as anything else. I hope this will be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>We have to express our confidence in young people who are much more confident than our generation. They have the necessary confidence from their early teens to deal with people on a one to one basis. We were well past our teens before we had such confidence.</P>
    <P>There is a need to ensure youth groups have sufficient funds. Otherwise, they will become just another failed entity. The word &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; has been mentioned. In this context, there is a need to look at the percentage of funds which can be spent on administration in such organisations. In many cases it has been found &ndash; one could take health boards as an example &ndash; that there has been an increase in the number of management and clerical staff to the detriment of the end user. I would not like that to happen in the case of the groups involved in youth work.</P>
    <P>There is a need for people to become aware of their responsibilities as citizens. While services will, in the main, be delivered through the vocational education committees, there is a need for people to become involved in youth work through the education system. If a number of our social problems had been dealt with at an early stage, people would not experience them. Examples are, joyriding and wandering horses in Dublin. The latter has been turned on its head by the action that was taken to educate young people on how to treat and care for animals. That is good youth work.</P>
    <P>The problems young people have in obtaining motor insurance is a major problem in rural Ireland. If they were properly educated in how to drive, be courteous on the roads and address driving related problems there would be a greater reduction in the number of accidents. The net result would be that insurance costs would fall <Col N="1064" /> and come within the capacity of young people many of whom cannot afford or obtain insurance at the moment. Something must be done to facilitate their needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should make sure he secures adequate funding to deliver the service. He should fight for a percentage of national lottery funding to be allocated to this area and seek to have that funding matched by the Department of Education and Science. This is education at its best as people will be educated to be good citizens. We want them to become involved in various community groups and clubs to learn what it is like to be involved and working for themselves and their communities at an early stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Minister of State the principal purposes of the Bill are to define what youth work means in a clear and concise manner; to detail the policy, budget, research, monitoring and assessment functions of the Minister regarding youth work; to define the functions of the vocational education committees regarding youth work, particularly the procedures for planning, prioritising, funding and reporting on the provision of youth work programmes and services; to establish a special youth work committee in each VEC area; to provide for the continuation of the national youth work advisory committee and to expand the voluntary committee to reflect to a greater degree the current composition of the youth work community; to formalise the allocation of grants for youth work; to establish voluntary youth councils to represent the needs and demands of the voluntary sector at local level and to permit the appointment of a national assessor of youth to ensure the best use of Government moneys in the provision of youth work programmes and services.</P>
      <P>These are worthy objectives and taken together provide a statutory framework for the provision of youth work programmes and services. I have no doubt such a framework is needed. However, I hope the Minster of State can give assurances that it will encourage flexibility, spontaneity and initiative at local level. The last thing we want is an over-bureaucratic structure discouraging new ideas and projects on the ground. Initiative must be encouraged under this structure.</P>
      <P>I welcome the emphasis on volunteerism in the legislation. Youth work is largely based on adult and youth leaders giving of their time and efforts freely and long may that continue. This year is the UN Year of the Volunteer and it is timely that we should reflect on the role of the volunteer in our society, that we celebrate him or her and that we ensure volunteers continue to come forward. Our colleague, Deputy Flood, at the invitation of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs chairs a committee which deals with this matter. I wish him every success in his deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are signs that volunteer numbers are declining and this is regrettable. There are many reasons for this and other Members have already <Col N="1065" /> put forward suggestions. Unprecedented economic growth means that everybody, young or old, male or female, is encouraged to work in the marketplace and, thus, there is less time available for voluntary work. More money means more disposable income for entertainment and so on. Volunteer numbers as a result are declining. Nevertheless we should do everything possible at Government level to halt this decline.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to Comhairle Le Leas Oige, the youth service board in Dublin city. It is an effective and efficient organisation and is very active in promoting youth activity. The board spends its budget wisely, in a manner which ensures its money benefits youth activity in the community. It is not a bureaucratic organisation and nobody wants such organisations in this field.</P>
    <P>For example, there is a large number of youth organisations and services in my constituency of Dublin North Central such as the Harmonstown youthreach service, the anchor youth centre in Artane, the Donneycarney youth project, St. Paul's youth club in Artane, St. Monica's youth club in Edenmore and St. Luke's youth club in Kilmore West together with a large number of scouting clubs and summer projects. They provide an invaluable service to young people and the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Many of these groups and organisations are based in disadvantaged areas where young people are particularly vulnerable and in these circumstances their role becomes even more important. I highlight also how important the local drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services fund are in directing substantial funds to these areas with the aim of tackling social exclusion. The money has been well spent and such spending should be continued.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous pressures on young people in the modern world, particularly in regard to drugs and alcohol. It is important that alternatives are made available and youth services are one alternative. I agree that while there are facilities on the ground, more are needed and they must be improved. A structure will be put in place following the enactment of this legislation and the time has come to move forward to provide improved facilities, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I received a submission on the Bill from the Donneycarney youth project. The administrators of the project have three concerns. Their first is that it does not mention community youth work or the community dimension of youth work and they would like that to be rectified. Second, they point out that the Bill establishes the national youth work advisory committee but nomination of the representatives from the voluntary and community sectors will be in the hands of one prescribed representative body, the National Youth Council of Ireland. They suggest the NYCI does not represent local, independent management committees which manage significant resources and staff in the provision of youth work in Dublin city and they ask that separate rep<Col N="1066" /> resentation be provided for the 60 independent community management committee-youth workers on the national youth work advisory committee by way of amendment.</P>
    <P>Their third concern relates to the introduction of new programmes or services in a local area. In particular, it highlights section 11(1)(<i>a</i>) which will require the VEC to publish a notice in at least two newspapers inviting organisations to submit a proposal for the provision. They suggest this will mean that the local community will compete with voluntary organisations for funding to deliver and manage local products and services. This procedure could prove to be to the advantage of larger organisations and runs a real risk of undermining the current practice in the city where communities manage their own projects and youth services with the support of the City of Dublin Youth Services Board. In that regard, they have proposed an amendment which has been submitted to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to joyriding which is still a major problem in certain areas of Dublin and in other areas of the country. From time to time it receives media attention but more often than not it does not. The problem is still there, however, and it is confined to certain areas. I welcome the fact that the Garda Síochána continually monitors trends in the theft of vehicles with a view to identifying persistent offenders and targeting areas prone to such activities. For example, Operation Steeringwheel is in place in the Coolock area to tackle the problem of joyriding there. That operation is ongoing and comprises uniformed Garda foot and mobile patrols targeting specific locations on a nightly basis. Other initiatives have also been launched by the Garda, including a special resource unit comprising one sergeant and eight gardaí to target instances of joyriding in west Tallaght. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed me recently that each Garda division has a traffic unit which targets joyriding incidents outside peak hours. I have also been informed by the Minister that the Garda Síochána is actively involved in a number of diversion programmes and projects which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform funds with a view to diverting juveniles away from this type of crime. Such Garda initiatives must be encouraged because the joyriding problem is still there.</P>
    <P>As regards the problem of wandering horses, pony clubs and other equine projects must be promoted in certain areas to encourage young people to take up such pursuits. In that way, young people can be trained to deal with horses. It is a worthwhile interest which should be promoted by the authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate and I have carefully noted their comments. Their views have been helpful and I will undertake to keep an open mind on alternative views and comments <Col N="1067" /> as we proceed through the various stages of the legislative process. Our objective is to get the legislation best suited to the needs of the youth work community.</P>
      <P>I will address briefly some of the points raised by Deputies and others in the wider community in response to the Bill. Several speakers referred to the level of funding available to the youth work service. Apart from structural considerations, I am very concerned with the funding made available for youth work. Deputies have rightly pointed out that many schemes and programmes are operated by a number of Departments and agencies. In many instances, youth work organisations avail themselves of funding from a number of sources. Through the increased co-operation and co-ordination envisaged in the Bill, it will be possible to achieve a more strategic approach to the funding of youth work services.</P>
      <P>Since taking office I have managed to have funding to the youth work service increased from a baseline of £13.3 million in 1997 to £18.2 million in 2001. This represents an increase of no less than 37%. Apart from this significant additional funding for youth work and the Youth Work Bill itself, the national youth work advisory committee is at present preparing a national youth work development plan which will provide a blueprint for the development of youth work over the next five years or so.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the references made by Deputies to the unique position of volunteers in the Irish youth work movement. I have outlined the high regard and esteem in which I hold the many volunteers who contribute so magnificently to youth work and, indeed, those who contribute in other fields, such as adult literacy. I hope this tradition will continue to grow and prosper as it is a vital component of community services.</P>
      <P>This is the United Nations International Year of the Volunteer and my Department will be playing a full role in an appropriate fashion to celebrate this event, which includes representation on the national committee on volunteering, set up recently by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. I am aware that the committee also includes a significant number of volunteers. This is very appropriate in view of the long and staunch contribution made to Irish society by volunteers, particularly in the area of youth work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has been expressed that undue emphasis may be placed on the needs of disadvantaged youth at the expense of the wider youth community. It is of paramount importance that the youth work service should address the question of social inclusion, but not without the realisation that all young people are entitled to the benefits of an informal process of personal and social development. I assure the House that through the good offices of the national youth work advisory committee, the voluntary youth work sector, together with the statutory agencies, will have every opportunity to guide the Minister, <Col N="1068" /> the vocational education committees and the Department in the application of funding schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton referred to the need to ensure that where there is a Gaeltacht in a VEC area, the Irish language youth organisations of that area should have guaranteed representation on the local voluntary youth council. I agree it is most important that we safeguard our heritage and promote Irish for youth as a living language. In many instances, the voluntary youth councils will have a role to play in this matter. However, on reflection, the best way to secure adequate representation for these youth work organisations is through the preparation of the guidelines under which the voluntary youth councils will operate, rather than directly through legislation. I am confident that the national youth work advisory committee will have full regard to this necessity in advising me on the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton also referred to the fact that there is particular regard to be had to the youth work requirements of young people aged between ten and 21 who are socially or economically disadvantaged. The Deputy sought to have the issues of age and disadvantage separated. I appreciate what she has said and I will give this matter further consideration.</P>
    <P>The issues of accreditation and training are of concern to the youth work sector and are currently being examined in the preparation of the national youth work development plan. I expect that it will contain a number of interesting recommendations in this regard. As Deputy Dennehy pointed out, professional services are provided not only by paid full-time youth workers, but also by those acting in a voluntary capacity. We must address the requirements of full-time workers and those volunteers who wish to commit themselves at the highest level to our youth work needs.</P>
    <P>The question of specific guidelines for those working with young people, adapted from the national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children, is being addressed by the National Youth Work Advisory Committee. Guidelines have been drafted and a sub-committee of the advisory committee has been formed to prepare a comprehensive training implementation plan. I anticipate that the committee will report to me soon in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford noted that it might be desirable for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to have representation on the advisory committee. I assure him that the matter was examined when the Bill was being prepared. It was agreed between my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development that youth work development matters should be addressed locally within the youth work committees of the vocational education committees and local voluntary youth councils.</P>
    <P>Deputies Sargent and Ring made the point that we should be creating recreational facilities for <Col N="1069" /> our young people. I agree fully with these sentiments and the process is already under way. The young people's facilities and services fund has,<i> inter alia</i>, earmarked over £37.5 million over the first three years of its life for the capital costs of recreational and sports facilities and current services for young people in local drugs task force areas and six designated urban areas. This money will support 87 projects. Beneficiaries will include such worthwhile endeavours as the Mulhuddart community centre, the Knocknaheeny community resource centre and the sports and community centre at Pearse Park in Crumlin. So concerned is the Government to ensure the success of the scheme and the capital projects it supports that it recently made available an additional £2.6 million in respect of 44 of the projects. The young people's facilities and services fund is a major investment in the welfare of disadvantaged young people and young people at risk.</P>
    <P>In the final four years of the national development plan, it is intended that funds will continue to be available for capital and current projects.</P>
    <P>The Bill envisages that local and national youth work organisations have slightly different means of designation. It is being said that to grant national status to organisations which operate in as few as two vocational areas is somewhat nonsensical. I remind the House that the system of grant-in-aid for national youth work organisations, which has been in place for almost 20 years, operates on a similar basis. The youth services grant scheme provides national lottery funds to support the administration of national and major regional youth work organisations. The use of the term &ldquo;national&rdquo; in the Bill is for convenience sake. To restrict national designation to groups which have a comprehensive national service area would do a disservice to a great many voluntary bodies. Indeed, only a handful of the organisations in the youth services grant scheme have a presence in the majority of VEC areas. The principle which currently governs grant-in-aid has proved entirely satisfactory and has the support of the voluntary sector. Accordingly, I do not propose to take any action to change the criteria as outlined in the Bill. Indeed, the national youth work advisory committee will, in due course, advise me of further criteria to be applied in the cases.</P>
    <P>The membership of the national youth work advisory committee has been enhanced beyond the provisions made in the Youth Work Act, 1997. I am very pleased to include so many bodies with an interest in youth work services. While it has been possible to detail the exact statutory sector representation on the committee, the same cannot be said for the voluntary sector. It would not be right for the Minister to decide whom from among the extended national youth work community should represent that community. Instead, there will be a single nominating body for the voluntary sector which is of the voluntary sector. I remain convinced that nominations to the advisory committee should come from a single rep<Col N="1070" /> resentative organisation to encourage co-operation and cohesion within the youth work community.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Work Council of Ireland has a long and distinguished record of service to the voluntary youth sector. My Department was very conscious of its likely role in the new scheme throughout the drafting process and felt that the creation of the prescribed national youth work representative organisation as a nominating body to the national youth work advisory committee is fundamental to this Bill. It had been suggested that the National Youth Council of Ireland should be named in the legislation as the nominating body and I will address this matter further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One of the key provisions of the Bill lies in section 16 and allows for the appointment of a national youth work assessor. As some of the Deputies may be aware, the process of appointing an assessor is already under way. Sanction has been received from the Minister for Finance for the appointment and the relevant officials are making preparations for an open recruitment process that will have as its aim the appointment of the best candidate for the position. It is expected that the initial appointment will, subject to satisfactory performance, be for a period of five years. It is essential for the effective implementation of this Bill that this post is filled by a person with a broad range of skills and an in-depth knowledge of youth work. It is my intention that a great deal of effort should be taken to ensure that this process succeeds. There will be a very heavy workload involved in the execution of the assessor's functions and, accordingly, further consideration will be given to the support needs of the assessor.</P>
    <P>It has been highlighted that there is unease among the voluntary youth work sector regarding the functions of the national youth work assessor in relation to decisions vocational education committees and the Minister to reduce funding to organisations. The view has been expressed that the assessor's role in hearing and commenting on the representations of an organisation in such a position may be contrary to natural justice. Advice has been given that the procedures outlined in sections 8, 10 and 35, giving the assessor the power to act as an intermediary on behalf of youth work organisations, are consistent with good practice and entirely within the scope of natural justice. This is not an appeal process. It is a clarification procedure and, as such, the provision for organisations to supplement their cases and make further submissions prior to any decision which might adversely affect them is most important and I think has been widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>The national youth work development plan currently being prepared will address many of the issues raised by Deputy Deenihan. The national youth work advisory committee has representation from the various Departments which will also financially support youth work. The commit<Col N="1071" /> tee will co-ordinate youth work being done by other Departments. Deputy Ring made a case for funding for local clubs and organisations. For this very purpose, I initiated a scheme for local youth club grants in 2000 and allocated £1.13 million through the vocational education committees for this scheme. The scheme will enable local clubs to draw down funds for the very purpose about which Deputy Ring spoke.</P>
    <P>The Castle Saunderson project was mentioned by a number of Deputies. The Minister for Finance was approached by me, as I promised, and explained in a recent parliamentary reply that proposals for funding of a permanent jamboree campsite at the Castle Saunderson Estate in County Cavan for Scouting Ireland have been received and are currently being considered in the context of developing and promoting North-South relations. He said this consideration will explore the opportunities for funding the project under either of the two new EU supported programmes for cross-Border co-operation, namely the INTERREG III programme and the Programme for Peace and Co-operation 2000-2004. The Minister for Finance understands that the authorities in Northern Ireland have not been approached with a similar request for funding.</P>
    <P>The Youth Work Bill is the result of extensive consultation with all interested parties and a great deal of consideration and contemplation. It is also the best expression of the wishes of and replies to the needs of youth workers, youth work organisations, local and national Government and, most of all, young people. I am confident that the majority of the voluntary youth work sector welcomes the Bill and will be pleased to see its terms implemented in the months ahead. I again thank the Members who contributed to this discussion and I look forward to a further constructive debate on this matter as it proceeds through the other Stages. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> This is important but rather technical legislation which will enable Ireland to play its part in strengthening the international policy arrangements designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>Ireland has long played an active role in international efforts to further the cause of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The key to this has been the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the NPT, which came into effect in 1970. The NPT is the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. The objective of the NPT is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, to promote co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to further the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament.</P>
    <P>A central provision of the NPT is the implementation of safeguards agreements between states and the International Atomic Energy Agency &ndash; the IAEA. The IAEA safeguards system, pursued under these agreements, is aimed at ensuring that nuclear materials and nuclear equipment intended for peaceful use are not used for the production of nuclear weapons. It is the means by which the IAEA verifies that states are acting in compliance with their international non-proliferation obligations, primarily through the collection and reporting of information in relation to goods and materials related to the nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>A fundamental objective of Ireland's foreign policy is to uphold the NPT and its non-proliferation regime. At this juncture, our concern is that without serious strengthened safeguards to underpin its purposes and provisions, the NPT will wither and die through complacency and neglect.</P>
    <P>The Bill will transpose into domestic law a Protocol signed by Ireland and the 12 other non-nuclear weapons states of the EU in September 1998 with the IAEA. This Protocol to the Safeguards Agreement is aimed at strengthening the existing Safeguards Agreement.</P>
    <P>Under the safeguards agreements, the IAEA establishes an inventory of nuclear materials on the basis of information provided by the states. In addition, IAEA inspectors regularly visit states' facilities to verify records which state authorities keep on the whereabouts of nuclear material under their control; to check IAEA installed instruments and surveillance equipment, and to confirm physical inventories of nuclear material. This basic tool of nuclear material accountancy employed by the IAEA relates to safeguards material declared by a State pursuant to the Safeguards Agreement. It establishes the quantities of nuclear material present in a nuclear facility and the changes in these quantities that take place over time, it is comparable in both concept and procedures to a financial accounting system.</P>
    <P>The current Safeguards Agreement between the EU, the non-nuclear weapons states of the <Col N="1073" /> EU and the IAEA has direct operational implications for Ireland only in respect of certain insignificant quantities of fissionable material held at University College, Dublin, and University College, Cork. In accordance with the existing agreement, these materials have undergone inspection by EU inspectors on behalf of the IAEA.</P>
    <P>Under the existing safeguards agreements, the capability of the IAEA to detect undeclared nuclear activities is limited. IAEA inspectors are not currently permitted to carry out random searches for undeclared nuclear material or clandestine nuclear activities.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the Gulf War, elements of an Iraqi programme to develop nuclear weapons were discovered. About the same time, accounting irregularities in respect of North Korean nuclear materials were also revealed. These two states are parties to the NPT and appropriate measures have been taken by the UN Security Council to deal with these cases of non-compliance with NPT obligations. Neither of these cases, however, has been fully resolved to date. While there has been no new allegation of non-compliance by non-nuclear weapons states, the satisfactory resolution of earlier cases remains a matter of concern to Ireland. Since these discoveries, which demonstrated the shortcomings of the existing safeguards agreements, the IAEA Secretariat and the IAEA member states have been working to introduce a strengthened and more rigorous inspection and verification system.</P>
    <P>Some new measures have been implemented within the legal authority of the existing safeguards agreements. In addition, a model protocol additional to the Safeguards Agreement was approved by the IAEA's board of governors in May 1997. The model protocol which Ireland and the 12 other non-nuclear weapons states of the EU signed up to in 1998 with the IAEA embodies new and more powerful measures to help the IAEA verify compliance by states with its safeguards undertakings.</P>
    <P>The Protocol's measures include, <i>inter alia,</i> the obligation to provide additional information on nuclear and nuclear-related activities, additional access to locations not currently subject to safeguards and the use of new verification techniques. The objective is to alert the international community more quickly and efficiently to the possibility of undeclared nuclear activities and to improve the level of confidence about the absence of such activities. It is the Government's strong wish that Ireland ratifies the model Protocol as soon as possible and this Bill will provide for its ratification and for its implementation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Early ratification of the Protocol is in line, not only with Ireland's long-standing position on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, but also with our position on nuclear safety. The IAEA plays a vital role in promoting nuclear safety worldwide. Over the years it has developed common safety standards in regard to nuclear safety and radiation protection and has fostered <Col N="1074" /> information exchange between its member states. In the IAEA, Ireland has been to the forefront in promoting international conventions on the management of radioactive waste and nuclear safety. Ireland, which has taken a seat on the IAEA board of governors in September last, has always strongly supported the IAEA's nuclear safety and radiological protection activities.</P>
    <P>The NPT, as the House will be aware, was inspired by a series of resolutions put to the UN General Assembly by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Frank Aiken, beginning in 1959. It was opened for signature in 1968, and since then the number of states party to it has steadily increased, to the point where today only four states remain outside it &ndash; India, Pakistan, Israel and Cuba, although Cuba is party to other international nuclear non-proliferation agreements.</P>
    <P>The obligations of the NPT are twofold. For those states who adhered to it and had not already in 1967 acquired nuclear weapons, there was an obligation to refrain from the acquisition of nuclear weapons and to subject all activities which involved fissile nuclear material under their jurisdiction to inspection. The implementation of these obligations requires states to accept inspections by the &ldquo;Safeguards&rdquo; inspectors of the IAEA.</P>
    <P>For those five states that had already acquired nuclear weapons, the United States, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom, there is an obligation to end the nuclear arms race and to engage in negotiations leading to the elimination of their nuclear weapons. The NPT also includes guarantees of the right of states to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, and the concomitant obligation to have a safeguards agreement with the IAEA.</P>
    <P>Conferences to review the operations of the NPT have been held at five-year intervals since it came into force in 1970. The NPT also included a provision for the convening of a conference 25 years after its entry into force to decide whether it should continue in force indefinitely. The 1995 review and the extension conference decided that the NPT should continue in force indefinitely. It also took the decision, as part of an overall package, to include a series of principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, a strengthened review process and a resolution on achieving a nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>The first review conference since the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 took place in April and May of last year. The Minister for Foreign Affairs led the Irish delegation. This conference demonstrated a commitment by 182 states to refrain from the acquisition of nuclear weapons, which is a singular achievement. Unfortunately, the goal of the treaty to achieve the total elimination of nuclear weapons has not been realised.</P>
    <P>The NPT has provided the states that have refrained from the development of nuclear weapons with assurances that others would exercise similar restraint. The non-nuclear weapons states, <Col N="1075" /> party to the NPT, have implemented these NPT undertakings in the context of corresponding legally binding commitments by the nuclear weapons states to eliminate their weapons. That is the underlying bargain of the NPT, which is copperfastened by the IAEA safeguards regime.</P>
    <P>On each of the five previous occasions when the states parties met to review the implementation of the NPT, the non-nuclear weapons states have insisted that the nuclear weapons states demonstrate greater determination to achieve the goal of a nuclear weapons free world. The policy statement, Towards a Nuclear-Weapons Free World: the Need for a new Agenda, was originally put forward by Ireland and six other countries. This has now been co-sponsored by no less than 60 states of the UN. Its aim is to accelerate progress. At the review conference last year the Irish delegation called for a fundamental change in approach if we are to achieve a world without nuclear arms and outlined the reasons why Ireland had launched the New Agenda initiative, stating that &ldquo;a decade after the end of the Cold War it has become clear that neither nuclear strategies nor arms controls efforts were predicated on the elimination of nuclear weapons at an early date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The New Agenda is a full agenda, and sets down those steps that must be taken to realise the establishment of a nuclear weapons free world. That includes, in particular, the entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the CTBT, and the negotiation of a treaty banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes, the cut-off treaty, or FMCT. The current treaty structure &ndash; the NPT and the treaty banning nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water &ndash; has had considerable successes in limiting the number of nuclear weapons states. However, that structure left a clear gap by permitting the nuclear weapons states to continue testing new weapons underground. The solution to this problem was found in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which removes the anomaly by forbidding all nuclear weapons tests anywhere. For this reason Ireland has long been a consistent and active supporter of this treaty.</P>
    <P>Ireland and its EU partners have expressed their deep regret at the failure of the US Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The treaty cannot enter into force without the ratification of the US. It would be an empty treaty without American adherence. However, the previous US Administration's commitment to ratify the treaty, as well as its announcement that the US will abide by the moratorium on nuclear testing, in place since 1992, is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The New Agenda is a call for a fundamental shift in attitude on the part of the nuclear weapons states. It calls upon them to &ldquo;make an unequivocal undertaking to the total elimination of their respective nuclear weapons.&rdquo;  The second commitment of the New Agenda is to give sub<Col N="1076" /> stance to that commitment in a programme of action.</P>
    <P>The New Agenda also calls for the nuclear weapons states to engage in measures which would contribute to strategic stability in the interim until nuclear weapons are eliminated. These include measures to reduce current hair-trigger status of weapons systems by de-alerting and then proceeding in time to removing warheads from delivery vehicles. There is also a call for the revision of nuclear war fighting doctrines, which are currently premised on the first use of nuclear weapons and the demand for the removal of tactical, or battlefield, nuclear weapons &ndash; archetypically first use weapons &ndash; from deployment pending their elimination.</P>
    <P>The NPT review conference of last year produced an agreed final document which reinforced the underlying bargain of the NPT. States which have refrained from developing nuclear weapons have received an unequivocal commitment from the nuclear weapons states that they will accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear weapons through a number of steps laid out in the document. However, we must not be lulled into a sense of complacency by the achievement of an agreed programme of action. This programme represents a clear obligation to make nuclear disarmament a reality and for our part Ireland is determined to work vigorously to achieve this goal.</P>
    <P>The final document contains much of the New Agenda objectives, and the adoption of an agreed final document with progressive language can be seen as a significant breakthrough. The NPT conference secured a new commitment from the nuclear weapons states to eliminate their nuclear arsenals. This commitment, along with the recent ratification of START II by the Russian Federation and the promise of early negotiations on a START III, augers well for the future.</P>
    <P>Over the past year we have witnessed many positive developments in the area of nuclear disarmament. We salute the US and the Russian Federation for the bilateral nuclear force reductions which they have undertaken to date and we encourage them to engage in the next steps with renewed vigour. Ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has been adopted by the Russian Parliament. With the ratification of the treaty by the two nuclear weapons states that are members of the EU &ndash; France and the UK &ndash; we have moved closer to establishing a norm that nuclear testing has no place on our small planet.</P>
    <P>It is important for countries, such as Ireland, which are at the forefront of the disarmament debate, to demonstrate their commitment to the NPT and its mechanisms. Early ratification and implementation of the Protocol to the Safeguards Agreement, which this legislation will enable us to do, is, therefore, a priority of the Government. The Bill allocates responsibility for the implementation of Ireland's obligations under the strengthened Safeguards Agreement to the <Col N="1077" /> Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. The relevant Departments will support the institute in the collection and reporting of material for relevant dual use products, which are products that can be used for civil or military purposes. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be responsible for the licensing of, and reporting of relevant information with regard to products which are exported. The Revenue Commissioners will conduct the monitoring and reporting with regard to information concerning the import of any materials and equipment coming within the scope of the protocol.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also provide for the granting of access to international inspectors, including, as appropriate, managed access to locations, facilities or sites to which the protocol applies. Verification arrangements are crucial to the IAEA safeguards system. Provision will also be made to give the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Revenue Commissioners powers to appoint inspectors and conduct inspections in conjunction with IAEA inspectors.</P>
    <P>There will also be a requirement on any person involved in areas to which the protocol applies to provide the prescribed information at the prescribed time and in the prescribed format. The Government also intends to make provision to regulate, by a system of prior licence, the manufacture, acquisition and use of all reportable material, as listed in Article 2, Annexes I and II of the protocol. The purpose of licensing is to facilitate full disclosure and assurance of the provision of relevant information under the protocol.</P>
    <P>The threat of nuclear weapons is still with us. If we are ever to rid the world of the threat of nuclear annihilation we must build an international regime which can, with confidence, detect nuclear weapons development programmes and provide assurances about their absence. The strengthened safeguard system which we are seeking to implement through this Bill will play a fundamental role in this. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

        <b>: </b>When I first received notification that the Bill was on the Order Paper for this week, I had to cross check several times whether it was being sponsored by the correct Minister and Department in view of the fact that we are talking essentially about non-proliferation of weapons and weaponry. I wondered whether the Departments of Defence or Foreign Affairs should be dealing with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>: </b>In view of the fact that the Minister of State has built up such a reputation in terms of dealing with issues such as the threat of radiation and indiscretions on the part of our counterparts across the channel, apart altogether from the fact that the Radiological Protection <Col N="1078" /> Institute of Ireland is the policing body, we are pleased to have the Bill, sponsored by the Minister of State, before the House today.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. As the Minister of State said, it fulfils our obligations under the international covenant to police the proper management of radiological activity and radioactive materials within our jurisdiction. The designated body for ensuring compliance with the International Atomic Energy Agency is the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. Its role is important but, in the current context, it is rather modest, in view of the fact that in Ireland's case we are talking about very small amounts of radioactive materials held in UCD and UCC. These have been inspected from time to time on behalf of the IAEA by the EU inspectorate. However, the fact that our nuclear possessions are comparatively insignificant is absolutely no excuse for our tardiness in ratifying the formal agreement.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was debated on Second Stage in the Seanad, Senator Costello rightly pointed out that the protocol was signed by Ireland in September 1998 and still had not been passed into law. That debate took place on 20 April and nine months later the Bill is only getting its Second Reading in this House. Why the delay? A point worth bearing in mind is that since last year Ireland holds a seat on the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency. How can one reconcile Ireland's right to sit on the board of such a body, monitoring international compliance, when we have not passed into domestic law simple legislation ratifying our obligation? What excuse is there for a delay of two years and four months from the date the protocol was signed to today, while the Bill has still to wind its way through two or three more Stages in this House? What is it about us as a nation that we sign up to protocols, agreements and covenants and invariably drag our heels when it comes to giving them legal domestic effect? Why can we not do our business at home given that we are so quick to rubber stamp agreements?</P>
      <P>When I was spokesperson on justice, time and again as we dealt with the various human rights legislation, we found ourselves grossly exposed as a nation where, having signed up to a raft of covenants, we failed miserably, sometimes over many years, in terms of giving effect to those particular covenants by way of ratifying them in our domestic legislative Chambers. Why do we leave such covenants languishing at the bottom of the legislative list of priorities? Apart from our commitment to the spirit of what we signed up to, there is little point in our lecturing countries which have nuclear weapons, or countries which carry out nuclear tests to expand their nuclear capability and capacity, or, indeed, countries such as Britain which have problems with THORP and Sellafield, if we fail to pass a simple straightforward Bill to give effect to what we signed up to almost two and a half years ago and which is agreed by all parties in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strengthening of existing safeguards is <Col N="1079" /> extremely welcome. I welcome in particular the fact that the IAEA inspectors carry out regular checks on nuclear facilities to satisfy themselves on the locations of the particular facilities, the condition of the materials and the fact that the IAEA installation equipment is in place and working satisfactorily. It is important that the international community, and people generally, are fully satisfied that there is an effective independent regulatory control system in place in which they can have full confidence. Notwithstanding the fact that the amounts of fissionable materials in this country are insignificant and modest, how many checks have been carried out by the IAEA on the materials in UCD and UCC in the past five years? When these checks take place, are they carried out by way of unannounced spot checks or are they notified to the authorities in advance?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State acknowledges that the ability of the IAEA to detect undeclared nuclear activities is limited. He acknowledges that inspectors acting for the IAEA are not allowed to carry out random searches for nuclear material which has not been declared. He gives assurances that the IAEA and member countries have been working to introduce more rigorous inspection and verification procedures. This is crucially important because these new measures were introduced in 1997. Can we say three years later with absolute certainty that they are effective? On the dismantlement of the USSR, one of the major fears was that some of the different component parts on becoming fully independent would have nuclear arsenals, possessions, potential and indeed pretentions. Thankfully, to date, these have not been realised. Has the IAEA verified the situation in these former Soviet but now independent republics?</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State rightly said, Ireland has always taken a leading role in insisting on the most stringent measures in dealing with radioactive waste and trying to get the international community to agree on agreed norms of compliance and unilateral declarations in relation to agreements in terms of non-proliferation and disarmament. From the point of view of the new agenda, this is another example of Ireland's leadership role in terms of ensuring the international community behaves itself. The fact that this began as a rather modest measure, signed up to by six countries and now signed by more than 60, again shows the foresight, vision and leadership of Ireland in terms of doing our part to ensure one of the great threats to the very existence of the globe is no longer as imminent as it was in the past. It is unfortunate that the collective international determination of the majority of countries around the world is not shared by the entire world community and that countries such as India, Pakistan, Israel and Cuba, notwithstanding their own arrangement in terms of nuclear weapons, have decided to opt out of the non-proliferation agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> One must look at India's plight today, the huge human tragedy of the earthquake and the cost in terms of human life and physically rebuilding and repairing the damage done. One must reflect on its plea to the world to help ease its plight following the devastation of the earthquake and then reflect on the millions of pounds spent on nuclear experimentation by that country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which is a very commendable measure. I am pleased it has belatedly found its way into this Chamber. I hope it will become law and that its aim to make the world a safe, stable and secure place, free from the awesome threat of a nuclear holocaust, will be realised.</P>

      <Quest>if the aural, oral, practical and written elements of the junior certificate and leaving certificate examinations will take place in 2001; if he will ensure that such examinations will be seen to be fair and non-discriminatory; if he will further confirm the practicality or otherwise of implementing a contingency plan in the event of some secondary teachers not being available to participate in examination supervision and marking; the proposals he has to make up for time lost for junior certificate and leaving certificate pupils due to strike action by secondary school teachers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that both the ASTI and the Government teams were able to reach agreement on a way forward. The process now agreed can contribute greatly to improved industrial relations between the parties. Great credit is due to the facilitator, Mr. Tom Pomphrett of the Labour Relations Commission, for his expertise and professionalism and I again express my public thanks to him in this respect. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to make further comment on the broader issues while the Labour Court process is continuing.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy and all students and their parents that the 2001 certificate examinations will proceed without diminution in either their integrity or validity. As I have indicated, the results of the examinations may issue later than usual if delays are experienced during the marking process. Some delay may be unavoidable in the case of the junior certificate. The priority will be to ensure that standards are maintained. It is essential that the high reputation enjoyed by our public examinations continues and that public confidence in the examination system is preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to contingency arrangements, I consider it incumbent on me as Minister to safeguard <Col N="1081" /> the examinations and, to that end, I have asked my Department to develop contingency plans for conducting and marking the examinations having regard to the necessity of maintaining a quality approach to the marking process.</P>
    <P>Resolution of the dispute remains the top priority. Preparation of alternative arrangements is simply prudent in the interests of the students. It is my sincere hope that there can be a resolution of the dispute through the work of the Labour Court and that, consequently, there will be no need to activate the contingency plans.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to time lost because of the dispute is that I am prepared to explore with the school representative bodies how the time available for tuition can be maximised for all examination candidates over the balance of the school year. I would in particular encourage students to remain at school for tuition to the very end of the final term and thereby to get the benefit of all available class time rather than engage in the usual practice of absenting themselves from school during the final days of the term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I also commend Mr. Pomphrett for his work to date in respect of this matter. The Minister will recall that, in October or November of last year, I recommended that the matter should be referred to the Labour Relations Commission, and that has now happened.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate whether, in the discussions that have taken place, the ASTI has given a guarantee that there will be no further disruption of or threat to this year's examinations? The contingency plans that have been prepared may not have to be used because, as the Minister will be aware, the secretary general gave a guarantee to a committee of the House that the examinations would proceed but that he would prefer teachers to be involved in the process. What arrangements have been made in respect of pupils who have lost time as a result of strike days or work to rule days and who are at a disadvantage in terms of attempting to compete in the examinations this summer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the LRC, I was anxious to encourage any form of intercession that was agreeable to both sides. There came a time in the dispute when this process was agreed upon and could be pursued. I welcome this development.</P>
      <P>In relation to the guarantees, in its letter the ASTI indicated that all industrial action would be suspended while the talks were in progress. We hope that those talks can be successful. In that event, the issue of a threat to the examinations will not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's third question related to the effect of the strike on students. We are discussing that matter at present in terms of how best to proceed. As the Deputy may be aware, some schools are making particular arrangements. We <Col N="1082" /> will be trying to co-ordinate action of this kind and it will have our full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the examinations will take place on time? Does he believe that the marking process will operate in the normal way? Will he give students a guarantee that a level playing field will apply and that the requisite arrangements will be made to allow them to make up for lost time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to place too great an emphasis on the contingency plans at present. As far as we are concerned, they are ready to be put in place if necessary. I assure the Deputy that the examinations will be held. At this stage it appears that there will be only a minimal delay in the issuing of the leaving certificate results. As far as the junior certificate is concerned, it appears that the results may be delayed by three to four weeks. I do not want to say too much because I want the talks to be successful.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that the talks will succeed because, as the Deputy is aware, the review body on higher remuneration in the public service has shown that the benchmarking process works and that it can ensure fair treatment and a comparison with the private sector. The PPF, for the first time with such an agreement, includes benchmarking. Concerns were expressed about how it would work and what would be the outcome. However, it appears that it is fair and reasonable as a means of comparison between the public and private sectors. Judges, hospital consultants, Deputies and Senators, higher public servants and employees of semi-State bodies have found that benchmarking works in their favour. In my opinion it will also work in favour of teachers. Senator Joe O'Toole of the INTO and Jim Dorney of the TUI have both made statements indicating that they recognise that fact. The review body's work is a good example of benchmarking in operation and if the process is given the opportunity to succeed it will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute is about a claim for an immediate 30% pay increase and the ASTI demand has been for a process to deal with that claim. A process, which involves the Labour Court examining the issues in the dispute, has <Col N="1083" /> now been agreed and I look forward to the proposals on pay which arise from this examination.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under the PPF a detailed examination and comparative analysis of the pay of teachers generally is already under way through the benchmarking system. In addition, I have made it clear that I would favour a commission on education and learning for life which would have a broad and supportive remit. I am developing proposals in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the grave concerns which have been expressed by the JMB and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals about a number of issues affecting the education system which must be addressed as a matter of urgency? Both bodies recently made submissions to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science and their proposals for a forum or commission on teaching are in the public arena. These groups have sought to draw attention to important issues concerning the status of teaching, teacher morale, the implications of legislation, the under-funding of education, curriculum and assessment and the lack of management training. These are fundamental issues which need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>These groups have expressed grave concern for the welfare of the education system unless these issues are dealt with urgently. They are concerned to ensure that any settlement to the current dispute does not centre solely on pay, but that there be some link between whatever mechanism is agreed and the broader issues which could be dealt with through a commission or forum. Does the Minister accept these points? Does he have in mind the broader remit for a commission on teaching?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is that pay is a separate issue which must be dealt with immediately. To some extent that is why I could not confuse the two issues. I had to keep pay separate and deal with it. It became clear in the discussions that the issue of pay and the 30% was the main issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the views expressed and I am not disagreeing with the Deputy. I am saying that pay was a very specific issue and it was difficult to progress other matters while there was such a dispute over pay and the way in which it should be addressed.</P>
      <P>I accept that the broader issues are very important. The Teaching Council Bill is envisaged as playing a major part in the profession and in recognising the professional dimension of teaching. Committee Stage of the Bill will soon commence and I look forward to progress in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the Teaching Council Bill, many <Col N="1084" /> other issues need to be addressed. We have not taken a broad look at education since the early 1960s. There have been many worthwhile recent developments in education which place an onus on us to institute a commission to look at the entire situation regarding education and learning generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the principals' association recently stated that the statutory requirements cannot be met because of the under-resourcing of education? Is he also aware that the association stated that reports required annually will not be completed, curriculum delivery will deteriorate, teacher morale will collapse, student absenteeism and disaffection will soar and the system will be exposed to litigation on all sides? That is a fairly damning prediction of what principals feel is likely to happen to the education system unless these issues are dealt with immediately.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not indicated that he has grasped the seriousness of the problem and the urgency others attach to the need to set up a commission. He said he is well-disposed towards the idea of a commission or forum. Has he a timescale in mind for setting of the commission and what will be its terms of reference?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Within a month. The timescale is immediate. There are many issues to be addressed in education. However, there has been a 45% increase in funding for education which has allowed an enormous amount of development. We will continue with that development to ensure it is as effective as possible. We will take heed of what the principals have said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most <Col N="1085" /> suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. In this context, issues which figure prominently in representations about student support will also be examined by the team. I will consider the appropriate response when I receive the team's report.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on student support, including the cost of the free fees initiative, amounted to approximately £250 million in 2000. Some 40% of third level students qualify for maintenance grants. Accordingly, any proposal that student grants be brought in line with social welfare payments for the unemployed would give rise to considerable additional cost, estimated by my Department to be in the region of £64 million per annum.</P>
      <P>There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities. I established an action group on access to third level deduction in September 2000 to advise on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. I expect to receive the group's report in the near future.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the Government's support of promoting equity in access, and as an initial step pending the findings of the action group, I announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grants entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>

Will he define what he means by a &ldquo;disadvantaged student&rdquo; in terms of these special grants? Does this refer to students disadvantaged by area or by social-economic status?</P>
      <P>In view of the fact he has asked for a report, does the Minister intend to contract out or hive off responsibility for maintenance grants to an agency or body outside the Department of Education and Science?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's latter question is one of the issues being considered and we will examine it as soon as we receive the report which is due at the end of March.</P>
      <P>Access officers have been appointed in most institutes and universities. Some of these appointments were made very recently. These officers will deal with issues as they arise. In general terms the students involved will come from a disadvantaged background <i>per se</i>, particularly from disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that student union campaigns resulted in over 18,000 students campaigning on the streets because of the inadequate level of maintenance grants? Does he accept that a grant of £49 is ridiculously low in view of the increased cost of living, particularly in the private rented sector? Does he propose to increase that grant to the level of social welfare benefits, in line with the central element of the student union campaigns throughout the country?</P>

      <P>I am giving priority to those who are disadvantaged. Once the report is available, we will be able to move fairly quickly in that area.</P>
      <P>In relation to the general level, I have increased the rate for the current year. The rate of increase in 1996 was 2.4%; in 1997, 1.6%; in 1998, 3.2%; in 1999, 4.6% and in 2000, 5%. Given that the reference figure at that time was just over 4%, those figures were a reasonable increase on that. A full examination of the situation is being carried out. A member of the union of students is on the task force to examine the area of disadvantage and those most in need in that regard. I am awaiting the findings of the general study in that respect and we will see what can be done at that stage.</P>

      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board and a nationwide educational welfare service with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school on a regular basis or otherwise receives an adequate level of education.</P>
      <P>As an initial step in the implementation of the Act, I am establishing a designate board, on a non-statutory basis for an interim period, to draw up detailed plans for implementing the various functions to be assigned to the board under the Act. Following this interim period, the board will be put on a statutory footing and the various provisions of the Act will be commenced as appropriate. It is envisaged that membership of the designate board will mirror, as far as possible, that of the statutory board.</P>
      <P>I am fully conscious of the importance of this legislation in tackling the problems of school absenteeism on a structured basis and I assure the Deputy that the early establishment of the board is a matter of priority for the Government.

There is considerable concern among education welfare officers that there is no board in place. Why is it necessary to have an interim board? Why can a statutory board not be appointed immediately?

That has been done and with one exception, we are ready to proceed. I hope to be able to move on that very shortly.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been the rate for a long time. That did not happen only last week. Various surveys reveal the drop-out rate is 19% or 20%. It is preferable to have everybody concerned involved from the start, otherwise the board will not start off on a good footing. Its membership will be completed shortly. Appointments to it involve boards of management and teachers. Other events taking place have not helped the acceleration of this matter. Much of the work involved has been done in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Ideas to provide a preventative rather than a disciplinary approach are being implemented by many schools. I was at a school the other day where I saw children sign a contract with Packie Bonner to attend school up to the summer and having done that they will be given a prize &ndash; a case in point where there is very bad attendance record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The precise details of the cause of the unfortunate accident in County Galway on Monday, 22 January are not yet available. Bus Éireann and the Garda Síochána have undertaken separate investigations into the accident. My Department will give careful consideration to the findings of the investigations as soon as the reports are to hand.</P>
      <P>My Department and Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, consider safety on school buses to be of paramount importance. Bus Éireann has a very good safety record and has clearly shown its commitment to safety over the years, through its promotion of high profile safety campaigns including, in 1998-99, a nationwide competition to find a team of students to act as a video production team to make a video about safety in travelling to and from school by bus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With such a large operation as the school trans<Col N="1089" /> port scheme, there is a need to be ever vigilant with regard to safety. As I announced recently, I have asked my Department in co-operation with Bus Éireann to review safety procedures on school buses. This review will examine in detail current safety procedures and all areas where improvements can be put in place to ensure a safer service for our children. I have requested that the examination be given priority status and completed within three months.</P>
    <P>All school buses operating in the Bus Éireann school bus fleet are subject to the Department of the Environment and Local Government's annual roadworthiness test. This test is carried out as directed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in test centres authorised by that Department. Only buses that have passed that test are used in school transport operations.</P>
    <P>Smoke emissions from Bus Éireann school transport buses are tested as part of the annual roadworthiness test, and are subject to the standards laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. To exceed the required smoke meter reading is regarded as a reason for failure, and such vehicles must be rectified before being resubmitted for testing. Bus Éireann vehicles have to meet the same requirements as those provided by private contractors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister of State does not yet have full details of the accident. Can he confirm the age of the school bus involved? Will he confirm that once he has received the full report, it will be published?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have to hand the age of the school bus involved, but I will communicate that information to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In relation to the publication of the report, it is not the usual practice to publish such reports. I have had discussions with my Department officials on that. There will also be a Garda investigation although I do not know if the Garda intend to publish their report. It is not usual practice to publish these reports because there may be certain sensitivities regarding the families of the children involved but I assure Deputy Bradford that I will look at the report when it comes in and if it is possible to publish it or to publish certain parts of it without causing legal implications or offending people's sensitivities I will be happy to do so. My instinct is in favour of publication and I will do so if at all possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned ongoing efforts regarding safety campaigns in the video. I have not seen the video but progress along those lines will only take us so far. How can we have a truly safe school bus system when the fleet is so old? Last week the Minister of State made the point on radio that the Irish school bus fleet is much younger than that in Britain but do we have a fleet replacement programme which is lowering the average bus age or are we simply replacing <Col N="1090" /> ten year old buses with other ten year old buses? Does the Minister of State intend to bring down the age of the fleet? School bus safety is paramount and surely the age of the bus is important in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The age of the school bus fleet is being lowered, albeit not as quickly as I would like. The reason the age was not lowered for many years was that there was no money available to Bus Éireann to replace their own main bus fleet. As investment in Bus Éireann rises, capital investment to upgrade its buses rises and it replaces older school buses with newer buses. Those taken out of service are relegated to the school bus fleet. That is an ongoing process which has now accelerated. While I do not deny we have some antiques on the road, the average age of the school bus fleet is coming down.</P>
      <P>There has been much media comment about the number of accidents involving school buses, a lot of which is misinformed and grossly irresponsible. A national newspaper ran an editorial recently stating that two people have been killed on school buses every year for the last ten years. That is the reverse of the truth. Since 1994 there have been five fatalities, all of which occurred in one unfortunate accident in County Wicklow and the driver of the other vehicle involved was subsequently prosecuted and convicted by the criminal courts. Talking to people in Departments of Education in other countries, the safety record of the Irish school bus system is regarded as exemplary.</P>

The intention is that this committee, which will be representative of the various interests involved in the education of the hearing impaired, will offer guidance to my Department on the future development of education services in this area.

    <P>I am also currently finalising arrangements for the establishment of the educational disadvantage <Col N="1091" /> committee and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in relation to this matter in the coming days. The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, makes provision for the establishment of a national educational welfare board to promote regular school attendance and ensure that appropriate education and training is provided for early school leavers. I have decided to establish the board initially on a non-statutory basis so that it can undertake the necessary planning and consultation work, prior to the formal commencement of the Act's provisions. The board will be put on a statutory footing once this work is completed. My Department has requested nominations for appointment to the board from the various education partners and relevant Government Departments and I hope to be in a position to make appointments shortly.</P>

Does the Minister accept that there has been considerable slippage in his Department since he took office last year? These are three very important committees but currently there is no policy in the Department regarding education for the deaf, there is no serious policy regarding educational disadvantage and Deputy Upton has already discussed the education welfare board.</P>

      <P>A planning and steering group was set up on 27 January 2000 in order to develop, advise on, facilitate and monitor the process of establishing the proposed Irish Academy for the Performing Arts. This group is chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare former President of Dublin City University, and has representatives drawn from the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Department of Finance, the Higher Education Authority, third level institutions, the Arts Council and bodies providing professional education and training in music, dance and drama. The group has met on a number of occasions and its work is ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the headquarters of the new academy are to be located on the campus of Dublin City University, it has always been the Government's clear intention that the academy would be an <Col N="1093" /> independent and autonomous body. All arrangements entered into between the academy and Dublin City University will underpin this autonomy. Precise arrangements in this regard will be a matter for the academy to determine in conjunction with the university.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>What stage has this concept reached and how far are we from a physical structure? If this academy is to be both autonomous and on the Dublin City University campus, how is that to be achieved if it must use the campus facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no particular difficulty with having an autonomous body in the same field and making use of particular facilities. The problem is more that the other bodies, who will co-operate with it, want to maintain their autonomy. This issue is still under discussion and there are difficulties in that area. However, the next steps will involve the appointment of an interim governing body and one of its first duties will be the appointment of a president. It will be necessary to go ahead with that appointment while discussions are still ongoing with the Royal Irish Academy of Music and the University of Limerick in relation to their participation in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>What relationship, if any, will the Academy for the Performing Arts have with the Dublin Institute of Technology, which has had a long involvement with the performing arts for more than 100 years? Does the Minister have a long-term view in terms of when he expects the academy to be a functioning entity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's original decision was to approve the establishment of an academy for the performing arts incorporating three aspects. The first was a headquarters and significant facilities on a site to be provided on the DCU campus, with music and drama training being provided by the Royal Irish Academy of Music and the Gaiety School of Acting respectively. The second aspect was a Limerick campus involving the existing Irish World Music Centre at the University of Limerick, while the third was an undergraduate professional dance facility based at the Firkrin Crane Dance Development Agency in Cork.</P>
      <P>The steering group is broadly representative and it has had difficulties getting all the boards to agree to particular measures, etc. In any event, it will be necessary to go ahead with an interim board and the appointment of a president on the DCU campus. It may be possible for the interim board to include the other bodies on one basis or another. There are different suggestions about how they might co-operate and work, but they are not finalised.</P>

      <P>The report of the Commission on the Points System, which was published in December 1999, represented the culmination of two years of intensive research, discussion and debate on the system of selection for entry to third level education. The report makes recommendations on a wide range of issues, including lifelong learning, access to third level education for mature students, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and students with disabilities, entry to health care courses, the leaving certificate grading and points system and many other topics.</P>
      <P>The report recommends that the points system be retained on the basis that it is well established, broadly fair and transparent and generally accepted by the public at large. Nonetheless, the report identified a number of weaknesses and drawbacks in the current system and it contains detailed proposals aimed at addressing them.</P>
      <P>Since the report was published, my Department has held consultations with the Higher Education Authority, third level institutions and other interested parties with a view to considering and implementing, where appropriate, the proposals contained in the report. A number of key issues have been addressed and I will mention some of these.</P>
      <P>Regarding access to third level education for disadvantaged-mature students, in September last year I established an action group on access to third level education, chaired by Dr. Cormac MacNamara. I asked the group to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated national framework to promote the participation at third level of students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students, building on the experience of current initiatives. I understand the action group has completed its deliberations and I expect to receive its report in the near future.</P>
      <P>Regarding a special rate of maintenance grant, as an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group, last September I announced the introduction of a special maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged maintenance grant holders, targeted at those most in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>Regarding entry to health care courses, my Department has requested the Higher Education Authority to establish a committee to explore the issue of introducing a preliminary third level course in life sciences as a prerequisite for entry into the health care courses. Regarding bonus marks for answering through Irish, following careful consideration of the recommendation in the commission's report that the bonus marks for answering through Irish in the leaving certificate should be abolished, I have decided nonetheless <Col N="1095" /> to retain the current system of awarding bonus marks. In taking this decision, I took account of the wider issues of public policy towards the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Many of the other recommendations in the commission's report fall within the responsibility of third level institutions themselves. The Higher Education Authority is currently pursuing these with the relevant institutions and I have asked the authority to keep me informed of ongoing progress in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be a second report. Will the Minister give a commitment that he will implement the findings and recommendations of the task force? A number of the recommendations in the report on the points system could have been acted on, but the Minister set up a task force. Will he give an assurance that he will not set up an implementation group or any other type of working party or advisory committee and that he will act on the recommendations? Will he publish the report of the task force as soon as it is available?</P>

      <P>The Government decision of 8 April 1997 was to locate at Skibbereen, on a pilot basis, an outreach centre of Cork Regional Technical College using a high level of telematic delivery of educational programmes. The centre was to have inter-active conference links with outreach centres at Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, and at the University of Missouri at St. Louis.</P>
      <P>Cork Institute of Technology, formerly Cork Regional Technical College, submitted proposals for two phases of the development of the outcentre on 12 June 1997. My Department requested sanction from the Department of Finance for expenditure for the planning phase of the proposal on 19 June 1997. There have been ongoing discussions with the Department of Finance in relation to Skibbereen. More recently, I announced my plans to strengthen the education base in regions which are not well served at present and to establish effective links with higher and third level institutions.

Now I must put trust and faith in the current Minister. Will he please get away from the departmental waffle and these worthless Fianna Fáil promises and tell me so that I can tell the people of west Cork that they can have some faith and confidence that after three and a half years the Government will implement that decision, which in the meantime has been endorsed by the HEA? Will the Minister say <Col N="1097" /> plainly and unequivocally that the job will be done and when it will be done, or will his word be as worthless as that of the other two Fianna Fáil gentlemen I mentioned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that for gaelscoileanna and Gaeltacht schools to be in a position to properly implement the revised Gaeilge curriculum, there is a need to ensure that suitable resource materials, including textbooks, are available for use by those schools. I am committed to ensuring that this is the case and a number of developments have taken place recently in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an interim measure, to alleviate the concerns expressed by gaelscoileanna and Gaeltacht schools, my Department, through the primary curriculum support programme team, issued in October 2000 an extensive list of resource materials available for teaching through the medium of Irish. This list was researched and prepared by experts involved in the development of the revised curriculum and can be used by schools in implementing the curriculum on a daily basis. In addition, and in order to ensure that schools were in a position to purchase appropriate materials as outlined on the list, my Department issued an Irish language materials grant to all gaelscoileanna and Gaeltacht schools in late November-early December. Schools received a grant <Col N="1098" /> equivalent to £100 for each teacher in such schools with a minimum grant to all schools of £500.</P>
    <P>However, more needs to be done. In this regard my Department has recently held meetings with the various educational publishers as well as all the educational partners through the forum of the primary curriculum implementation group. Representatives of the gaelscoileanna and Gaeltacht schools are included in all meetings of this forum. A clear commitment to ensuring that appropriate resource materials for the teaching of Gaeilge in Gaeltacht schools and gaelscoileanna was given by representatives of my Department at the last meeting of this group on 15 January 2001.</P>
    <P>Since that meeting officials within my Department, in consultation with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the primary curriculum support programme team have been examining various options with a view to putting in place a scheme which will ensure that new high quality resource materials are developed and produced for gaelscoileanna and Gaeltacht schools. It is expected that these discussions will be concluded very shortly and at that stage I will be in a position to announce detailed proposals. The education partners, including appropriate Irish language interests will continue to be consulted as proposals are formulated.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my commitment and that of my Department to ensure that suitable high quality materials are developed specifically for use in the teaching of Gaeilge in gaelscoileanna and Gaeltacht schools.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, in his last comment, has hit the bun chloch in the sense that the new substantially revised curriculum makes a requirement and that is in many ways the best foundation on which to build the extra resources. That is being done at present. There have been discussions with the publishers as recently as shortly before the end of last year. The publishers would not regard it as commercially attractive and, therefore, it must be done over the odds but, given that the curriculum is in place and that there is a definite requirement, that is the basis on which it must be done.</P>

      <Quest>his response to the urgent request from the local drugs task forces for a representative of his Department to join each task force, in view of the concern about the high level of educational disadvantage among the communities most affected by drug abuse; and if he will accede to this request.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2773/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is fully committed to the overall aim of the Government's drugs policy which is to provide an effective, integrated response to the problems posed by drug misuse. As part of this process my Department is represented at senior level on the national drugs strategy team, and on the interdepartmental group which, in turn, reports to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, of which I, as Minister for Education and Science, am a member.</P>
      <P>On the question of representation on the local drugs task forces, the areas covered by the local drugs task forces correspond, to a great extent, to areas covered by the area-based partnerships. The educational issues of concern to the drug task forces are also the concern of the education sub-committee of the partnerships. My Department is represented in each area partnership and provides the funding for full-time and part-time education co-ordinators to support the work of the partnerships. In the circumstances, given the need for co-operation and integration at local level, my Department proposed that it be represented on the local drugs task forces by the education co-ordinators of the partnerships. This was seen as a reasonable and workable arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> My Department is most anxious to help the local drugs task forces. For that reason, my Department has indicated that named officials within the Department will be the contact persons, where necessary, for the task forces. It has also indicated a willingness to meet periodically with the task forces' representatives to discuss any issues arising.</P>
    <P>My Department has also taken a number of initiatives in the fight against drugs. There are two drugs prevention programmes in place in schools. The programme in primary schools is called &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo;. This programme, which commenced in 1999, was introduced into 2,787, or 87% of, primary schools by the end of 2000. It is expected that 3,000 schools will have accessed support by the end of June of this year. This represents 94% of all primary schools.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>The second level substance misuse prevention programme, &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo;, has been introduced in approximately 570 post-primary schools. This represents 75% of the total number of post-primary schools. This programme has now been subsumed into the social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme and by the end of 2003 every school is expected to have SPHE as an integral part of its programme at junior cycle level. It is proposed that the &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo; programme will also become part of SPHE.</P>
    <P>The role of my Department in the fight against drugs is further strengthened by the young people's facilities and services fund. An Exchequer contribution of approximately £37.5 million over three years has been set aside for this fund which was established by the Government in 1998, to assist in the development of preventative strategies in a targeted manner through the provision of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.</P>
    <P>When I became Minister for Education and Science, I set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority. Poor educational achievement and early school leaving very often result in unemployment or under-employment later on. Education can play a key role in assisting economic, social and personal development in our most disadvantaged communities. Accordingly, I intend to provide additional resources at all levels of education to tackle educational disadvantage in all its manifestations.</P>
    <P>Towards that end, I announced the new programme last month which will be run over a three-year period and will cost some £26 million. The programme involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils. A key condition of participation in the new programme is that the additional resources must be used for the provision of holistic supports for pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. More than 2,300 primary <Col N="1102" /> schools will receive additional supports under the programme.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that educational disadvantage is a major factor in the incidence of drug addiction? Would he agree that this point has been identified by all the local drugs task forces and that is why they have requested the Minister to provide a representative of his Department?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the education co-ordinators of local area partnerships are not answerable for the actions of the Department? They are not employed directly by the Department. Would he accept that what local communities seek is a senior person, representing the Department, who is in the position to make decisions about education provision in disadvantaged areas?</P>
      <P>It is that level of person that is required so that that person will be educated in relation to local area partnership working and there will be feedback directly to the Department on the issues of most concern in areas of disadvantage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy would say we are not going fast enough but there are major industrial relations issues which have been discussed and Mr. Cromien played a part in this initially.

      <P>National surveys of reading in primary schools were carried out in 1972, 1980, 1988, 1993 and 1998 by my Department in co-operation with the Educational Research Centre, ERC, Drumcondra. Significant progress in pupils' reading achievement was recorded between 1972 and 1980.</P>
      <P>The most recent survey of reading achievement of pupils in fifth class in 1998 indicated that there has been no significant change in reading standards over the past 20 years. Teachers estimated that 10% of their pupils who participated in this survey functioned at a level that they considered as weak-inadequate, while another 10% functioned at third class level or lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of primary schools administer standardised, norm-referenced literacy tests to their pupils to monitor pupil progress and standards. The inspectorate of my Department evaluates literacy standards in schools during inspections and furnishes reports to individual schools and their boards of management. School and class records of pupil progress in literacy are kept within schools and are generally examined by the inspectorate during inspections. The results of such school-administered tests are not collated centrally by my Department. The main system for <Col N="1104" /> the collection of information regarding literacy standards is through the programme of national surveys of pupils in fifth class, in conjunction with the Educational Research Centre.</P>
    <P>I intend to continue the series of surveys at fifth class level and extend the programme to include pupils at second and third class level. From time to time, Irish students participate in international surveys of literacy attainment organised by the OECD or by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement. The results of the Programme for International Student Assessment, the PISA project, which examined literacy attainment of 15 year olds in 2000 are not yet available.</P>

      <P>On the main issue, it is clear that there has been a major problem for the past 20 years and it must be given a great deal of consideration. If it were easy to solve, the teachers would have solved it at this stage, but many other factors are involved, such as dyslexia and other learning difficulties, and that is one area to which I give priority, as the Deputy may realise. If we do that, we will begin to break down the problems.</P>

      <P>Initiatives begin in early childhood. It is with that aspect that the package of £26 million for the disadvantaged is concerned. It is concerned with tackling disadvantage in primary school and providing facilities and reading materials. Within the next week to a fortnight I will appoint a director for this area of disadvantage to follow through on those moneys and ensure they are spent in a supportive way. That will be very helpful because we have a good deal of experience of this area from the Breaking the Cycle initiative and other measures which have been in operation. The director will use that in training and supporting teachers and providing <Col N="1105" /> equipment in schools. Separate from that and alongside it, there is direct support for children with a disability.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, there is also the issue of a background of disadvantage with no reading experience. There are also learning and reading difficulties. A number of factors are involved.</P>

      <P>Primary schools' running costs are met by the Department's scheme of capitation grants and the local contribution. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools which include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since the Government took office in 1997. The grant has been increased from £45 per pupil in 1997 to £75.50 per pupil this school year. In addition, I have announced that a rate of £80 per pupil will apply in the 2001-02 school year. This constitutes an increase of approximately 77% over that period.</P>
      <P>In addition almost 2,300 primary schools will receive supplementary grants for the next three years under the major new programme launched by me early last month to address educational disadvantage. The amount of supplementary grant aid payable to each school at the rate of £50 per disadvantaged pupil is based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the school. These were identified through a comprehensive survey conducted on my Department's behalf by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, during 2000.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools last year. Under the terms of this grant all schools designated as disadvantaged and schools in the rural phase of the Breaking the Cycle scheme will receive an annual grant of £1,000 per school while all other schools will receive £500 per school. Circular 28/00 which issued from my Department to all schools in October 2000 outlines specific materials or activities on which schools may spend this grant. The circular specifically states that &ldquo;schools may also wish to use the grant to alleviate the costs incurred with the provision of swimming classes or other similar activities&rdquo;. My Department will shortly make arrangements for the issue of this year's grants to schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>It would not be feasible for my Department to introduce specific schemes whereby grant assistance would be provided to schools in respect of <Col N="1106" /> individual costs such as costs associated with swimming lessons. However, I am satisfied that the increases in the capitation grant referred to above combined with the annual physical education grant to all schools constitute a meaningful response to the need for increased funding for schools.</P>

      <P>The property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acquires school sites on behalf of my Department, has been asked to secure a site for a new school at Durrus. I understand that a site assessment and valuation is being undertaken and, as soon as this has been done, my Department will be in contact with the school authorities.</P>
      <P>The site acquisition will be 100% funded by my Department and 95% of the construction cost of the new school will also be funded. The local contribution in respect of the building costs will be 5% of the final contract amount, up to a maximum of £50,000. While every effort will be made to expedite the provision of the new accommodation, it is not possible to say at this stage when construction will commence until the site has been secured and architectural planning for the school has been completed.</P>

Approximately 40 children attend that Church of Ireland school in Durrus and the conditions in the old school are chaotic. It was condemned by the Department five years ago. I would appreciate if the Minister would take immediate steps to acquire the site and give the green light for finance to construct the new school.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works is pursuing this matter which we will press to have finalised. It has to ensure the site, which adjoins the existing school, is technically suitable. It has referred the matter to the Valuation Office and expects to receive a site valuation shortly. When this information is to hand and assuming the site is considered satisfactory, it will supply my Department with the details and seek confirmation of our willingness to purchase the site. We will then prepare the formal contracts for exchange. This will be done as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Title>Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill, 2000  [  Seanad ]  : Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which reinforces Ireland's position on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Concerns about nuclear safety are not confined to countries in which nuclear plants are located nor to countries which have deployed nuclear weapons for security purposes. Ireland's nuclear policy objectives place a heavy emphasis on nuclear safety and radiological protection. While some countries have retained nuclear power as an option for power generation, Ireland has opposed any net expansion of this industry while problems exist with nuclear safety, radioactive waste disposal, plant decommissioning, nuclear proliferation and the ever present risk of a nuclear catastrophe.</P>
      <P>Non-proliferation should be at the heart of any international security programme. No one set of activities can sufficiently address proliferation threats since they may encroach on national, international and global interests. It is the view of the International Atomic Energy Agency director that for over five decades strategies of national and international security have been intertwined with the concept of nuclear weapons as a strategic deterrent. The achievement of a nuclear weapons free world will crucially depend on a fundamental change in that concept of security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of an outright ban on the use or acquisition of nuclear weapons, a gradual approach was adopted under the 1970 treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Different commitments were given at the time by two distinct groups of states &ndash; for the five nuclear weapons states, that is, the states which had manufactured and detonated a nuclear weapon before January 1967, a commitment to divest themselves of those weapons through good faith negotiations, and for all other states a commitment not to acquire nuclear weapons and to accept the International Atomic Energy Agency verification of all their peaceful nuclear activities in return for assured <Col N="1108" /> access to peaceful nuclear technology through the technology holders.</P>
    <P>For the past three decades a variety of diplomatic and political strategies have been pursued to advance the twin goals of non-proliferation and disarmament. Progress towards a nuclear weapons free world will continue to be difficult as long as certain political and security realities and perspectives persist. Nuclear weapons have been progressively losing their value as a currency of power due to the political, legal and moral constraints on their use. This is very much to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>A non-proliferation regime for nuclear weaponry is primary. This has been almost universally agreed with some exceptions, as mentioned by other speakers. The commitment by the nuclear weapons states to accomplish the total elimination of nuclear weapons is a sign of hope. Security through economic, social development, good governance, respect for human rights and an agreed process for the peaceful settlement of disputes is, ultimately, the best disincentive to acquiring nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The traditional view of nuclear weapons as an effective deterrent is a mindset with which we have lived for decades. This mindset must be dissolved and replaced by alternative peaceful modes of assuring global security.</P>
    <P>While I fully support and welcome the Bill, there are a number of other issues, perhaps local to us in Ireland, which we should consider within its context. They have a bearing on the management of radioactive sources and are also in need of urgent consideration. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is the regulatory body with statutory responsibility for radiological protection in Ireland. The RPII has among its responsibilities that of representing the State on international bodies and being the competent authority under international conventions on nuclear matters. It has responsibility for monitoring developments abroad and radiological safety generally. For the purposes of the Bill, it is the national authority for the implementation of the protocol, as described.</P>
    <P>Some of the more immediate concerns to us in Ireland in regard to nuclear matters are worthy of consideration. I refer particularly to the risks posed by Sellafield. For a considerable number of years there has been serious concern in Ireland, particularly on the east coast, about the risk to health from the nuclear installation operated by BNFL at Sellafield. This concern has increased in recent years by the introduction at the site of a major new plant, now known as THORP. It is worth remembering that the original purpose of Sellafield or Windscale, as it was then known, was the production of plutonium for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. It is now in the business of reprocessing spent fuel from worldwide sources.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been expressed on an ongoing basis about Sellafield operations. Only relatively recently has it become clear that the standards in operation at Sellafield are anything but satisfac<Col N="1109" /> tory. The RPII has continuously expressed concern about discharges from Sellafield into the Irish Sea. It has always considered that the greatest risk to Ireland is through a major accident to the tanks holding radioactive waste on the Sellafield site. These tanks have been identified as representing possibly the greatest risk of an accident at Sellafield which could have serious consequences for Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is another matter still outstanding in relation to radiological protection. The Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill, 1998, is still awaiting completion. It has been at the Committee Stage for over 18 months. If we are to concern ourselves with the activities of the RPII, it would be timely to address the Bill in the House and ensure the amendment is introduced as soon as possible. The amendment is being made for a very specific purpose, that is, to protect the public by ensuring the practice of chiropractors in the use of X-ray equipment is clearly defined. I urge that this be done immediately. The medical exposures directive is also awaiting completion and has yet to be implemented. These are two substantial matters which should have been addressed long before now and it is not good enough that the legislation has not been implemented while hospital patients in particular are potentially at risk.</P>
    <P>Another problem which needs to be addressed with some urgency is the need for a storage facility for radioactive sources. This matter has been referred to many times by the RPII and many others with an interest in radioactive materials. It is very unsatisfactory that sources are stored at a number of locations throughout the country because of the lack of a central storage facility. Within the last year two sources were mislaid. Part of the reason for this is that there is no single identifiable storage facility at which such materials can be stored safely. I urge that this matter be addressed. While it is not directly related to the Bill, it impacts seriously on radioactive materials and should be looked at with some concern and urgency.</P>
    <P>The Bill has little relevance for Ireland, in a practical sense, other than through a reporting mechanism and the very limited responsibilities and actions which need to be taken, to which the Minister and other Deputies have referred. For the purpose of the Bill, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is the responsible authority. The explanatory memorandum states that the Bill, when enacted, will have no significant implications for the Exchequer or staffing levels. With the passage of time, however, many agreements take on a life of their own and do generate staff requirements and require specific resources to be provided. I would like to be assured that should this arise, the necessary resources will be made available to ensure the protocol is applied adequately and effectively. The threat of nuclear weapons has not disappeared. It is important, therefore, that international agreements are designed and operated to ensure nuclear wea<Col N="1110" /> ponry can be detected, audited and that appropriate reporting mechanisms are in place, as outlined in the legislation. However, as my colleague, Senator Costello, pointed out in the Seanad, the tardiness in moving the Bill is reprehensible and we should ensure it is passed with due haste.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide for us to ensure non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. I welcome it, but the Labour Party will table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party warmly welcomes any legislation that halts the proliferation of nuclear weapons or eliminates all nuclear weapons. Ireland, as the initiator of the non-proliferation treaty, has a highly reputable role in this area. Ireland was also one of the first states to champion the concept of nuclear free zones in the 1950s and we have also over the years supported and authored various disarmament initiatives, including the Government's new agenda disarmament proposals put forward by the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and I pay tribute to him for his initiative.</P>
      <P>However, I would like to address a few issues relating to containment of nuclear weapons and materials. I wonder whether this legislation will be of any assistance in protecting Ireland and other countries from these nuclear threats. In a country such as this which has neither nuclear weapons nor power plants we must be vigilant that this new protocol between the IAEA and EU member states does not in any way give a broader licence to the transport of certain nuclear materials through the State or water down Ireland's nuclear free status.</P>
      <P>The Green Party and many others would like legislation to be passed which would declare Ireland a nuclear free zone, not allowing any military ships or aircraft to enter Irish territory or seize our airspace unless the Government has firm information that nuclear weapons are not on board. This must contain an element of inspection by the Government. Therefore, in addition to passing legislation such as this, the Government should pass long overdue nuclear free zone legislation. Most of our local authorities have done so and I believe it is time the Government did likewise.</P>
      <P>When introducing the legislation the Government emphasised that, in addition to reflecting Ireland's long-standing position on nuclear proliferation and disarmament, it also reflects &ldquo;our position on nuclear safety&rdquo;. I wish to highlight an issue of nuclear safety on which I will try to get clear answers over the coming weeks, that is, depleted uranium, not just as it is used in DU weapons but also as it used in aircraft as a counterweight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the height of hypocrisy for the Government to promote a Bill such as this on the one hand while, on the other, signing up to co-operate with a military alliance based on nuclear weapons. The Green Party strongly opposed Ireland <Col N="1111" /> signing up to NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace, a military partnership which is serving to prop up NATO and give it a <i>raison d'être</i> after the Cold War. The leader of that alliance &ndash; the US &ndash; has failed to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty which the Bill is trying to implement. The NATO alliance is still wedded, not just to a nuclear weapons policy but to a first use policy, and has ships and aircraft equipped with such weapons travelling around the world and at military bases where nuclear weapons are stored. So much for the containment of such weapons.</P>
    <P>Similar comments can be made concerning the ongoing militarisation of the EU hastened by the Amsterdam Treaty, which the Green Party also strongly opposed. Ireland has signed up to a NATO linked European rapid reaction force and two of our partners in that force are nuclear weapons states &ndash; the UK and France. As the EU develops its common defence policy the House can be assured it will have a nuclear weapons element. I have not heard a Minister insist that the UK and France get rid of their nuclear weapons before Ireland participates in any military activities with them or with other NATO members.</P>
    <P>The recent NATO bombing campaign in the Balkans involved the use of DU weapons. We have heard of members of peacekeeping forces deployed there developing cancers. I received first hand reports of the after effects of DU weapons use in the Gulf War when I recently visited Iraq as part of a parliamentary delegation. DU weapons use has resulted in major contamination affecting civilians and military personnel and poisoning the environment. Many of us regard DU weapons as a form of nuclear weapon. What does the Bill say about such weapons?</P>
    <P>On Tuesday in the House the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, refused to call for a ban on DU weapons. He said Ireland would not use its position on the Security Council to call for such a ban. This is outrageous. Is this because the NATO Secretary-General, George Robinson has said DU is &ldquo;crucial to NATO operational effectiveness&rdquo; and Ireland does not want to hamper the operation of its newest partner in the PfP or its partners in the EU rapid reaction force?</P>
    <P>This raises fundamental questions. Will DU weapons be deployed as part of the standard armoury of the rapid reaction force? Will Irish soldiers train with such weapons? Will there be military manoeuvres at the Curragh which will enable our soldiers to train with such weapons? Can the Government give an assurance that our soldiers will not be exposed to DU weapons by &ldquo;friendly fire&rdquo; during a Petersberg Tasks enforcement operation? I have not yet heard whether the Taoiseach still believes that the NATO bombing during the Balkans War was unavoidable and warranted, as he agreed in a joint EU statement at the time. Knowing that DU weapons were used, does the Government still believe the bombing was warranted?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> Depleted uranium is already visiting our shores in another form, not as tank busting weapons but in airplanes. For many years depleted uranium has been used as a counterweight, a form of ballast in the tail sections of aircraft. The Green Party is deeply concerned that aircraft with such counterweights on board may be flying through Irish air space and using both Dublin and Shannon Airports. The 1992 El-Al air crash in Amsterdam, in which 50 people died and as a result of which toxic smoke caused ill-health among survivors, highlighted the presence of 390 kilogrammes of depleted uranium as wing ballast in the airplane. More than a year after the crash of a Korean Airlines aeroplane in December 1991 in Essex, England, one of the 20 DU counterweights from its tail section has still not been recovered and is lost at the bottom of a lake. The old Boeing 747 models and some DC-10s, as well as other aircraft, were built with DU ballast. Some of the old Boeings, particularly the 747-200 models, still operate out of Dublin and Shannon Airports; they operate out of Shannon once a day. The main carrier at Shannon Airport is Pakistan Airways.</P>
    <P>A worst case scenario examination of a Boeing 747 crash was carried out more than a decade ago by American physicist, Robert L. Parker. It was found that up to 250,000 people would run health risks as a result of inhalation or swallowing of uranium oxide particles produced by the rapid oxidation of DU in an air crash fire. Similar risks to health from airborne uranium from a burning wreck were also highlighted by Paul Lowenstein, technical director and vice-president of the US company which supplied the DU to Boeing.</P>
    <P>Are any checks undertaken to ensure that DU equipped planes are not flying into our airports? The Green Party has received reports from staff at Dublin and Shannon that DU counterweights are still being used in some planes using those airports. I am posing questions to the Minister about this matter and I hope that he will be able to give me some answers. If he cannot answer me today, perhaps at some future point he will investigate this. We can talk about this matter when discussing such legislation but we must have action as well.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all Deputies for their constructive contributions, in particular Deputies Jim Higgins, Upton and Gormley. Government policy is to uphold the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It is essential that countries such as Ireland, which have been to the forefront of the nuclear disarmament debate, should demonstrate their total commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the mechanisms for nuclear safeguards agreements which have evolved from the treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is simple and straightforward. Its purpose is to make provision in law for the implementation in Ireland of a protocol to the existing safeguards agreement between the EU, the non-<Col N="1113" /> nuclear weapons states of the EU and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The protocol which was signed up to by the parties in 1998 is aimed at strengthening the existing nuclear safeguards regime. The protocol will help to improve the effectiveness of the IAEA's safeguards system and will serve as a powerful tool for detecting clandestine nuclear programmes.</P>
    <P>Colleagues have raised some very pertinent points which I will endeavour to address. In his fine contribution, Deputy Gormley raised matters that were rather extraneous to the Bill, but that is not a criticism. I have often done that myself if I received a degree of latitude from the Chair, and will do so again, please God.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the kind of co-operation one needs. Deputy Higgins talked about the delay in ratifying this important protocol. I agree with him and also regret that delay. Indeed, the Bill was to have had its Second Stage debate last October but despite our best efforts it was deferred because other legislation was given priority. As a former Government Chief Whip, Deputy Higgins will know more than I do about getting into the queue for that. I share his concern, as we all do, but the Bill is before the House now and we will process it hopefully to conclusion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins inquired how often Irish facilities, such as those at UCD and UCC, are inspected under the IAEA safeguard system and if these inspections are unannounced. I think that was the gist of his question on that important matter. The Irish facilities are inspected roughly every three years and prior notification of such inspections is given. The most recent inspection was in May 1999. Deputy Higgins also inquired whether states of the former Soviet Union are subject to the IAEA nuclear safeguards regime. It is our understanding that States which are parties to the NPT, including states of the former Soviet Union, are subject to the full IAEA nuclear safeguards control regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Upton raised questions about the national radioactive storage facility. I agree totally with her that this is a necessary facility to have in place and it would make no sense not to have it. Only this morning I discussed that particular issue with the chief executive and new chairman of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. As the House will know, Deputy Upton is a former chairperson of that fine institute and I compliment her on the superlative way in which she carried out her role. I was very pleased to work with her in that capacity when she was chairperson of the RPII and I thank her for the excellence of her work there. She is particularly <i>au fait</i> with all aspects of the institute's work and is, therefore, well equipped to raise such pertinent questions. We have received outline proposals from the RPII for the establishment of such a facility as soon as a suitable site can be identified. As we speak, options are being <Col N="1114" /> explored and we will progress the matter as speedily as possible. I share the Deputy's concern and it would be irresponsible of us not to pursue that matter vigorously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton also raised the matter of the Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill. The Department of Health and Children is drafting legislation to give effect to the EU medical exposure directive. This legislation will also include provision that only registered medical practitioners can carry out X-rays. We are in close touch with the Department of Health and Children to ensure a speedy completion of its work in order to facilitate an equally speedy completion of that bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley raised the matter of depleted uranium. I will have that matter checked and will consult with colleagues in other Departments, particularly the Department to which the Deputy referred. As the Deputy has requested, I will inform him as soon as I have something of substance to report.</P>
    <P>The ratification and implementation of this protocol which the Bill seeks to achieve is fully in keeping with Ireland's track record on nuclear non-proliferation issues. I thank colleagues for their contributions and co-operation.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill gives effect in Irish law to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in connection with the carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, 1996 &ndash; HNS Convention &ndash; and also gives effect to the 1996 Protocol to the International Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims &ndash; LLMC.</P>
      <P>The main objective of the HNS Convention is to provide adequate, prompt and effective compensation for loss or damage arising in connection with the carriage of HNS on sea-going ships. The convention complements arrangements which have been in place since 1969 regarding civil liability and compensation in relation to oil pollution. The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Acts, 1988 to 1998, gave effect to those arrangements in Irish law. The Hazardous and Noxious Substances Convention is to apply to loss of life or personal injury, loss of or damage to property, environmental damage and the costs of preventative measures.</P>
      <P>LLMC 1976 establishes the basis on which claims may be made arising on foot of the various risks incidental to maritime transport and how they may be prosecuted and set maximum aggregate limits depending on the tonnage of vessel in question for claims arising from any one incident. The Merchant Shipping (Liability of Shipowners and Others) Act, 1996, gives effect to LLMC 1976 in Irish law. The 1996 Hazardous and Noxious Substance Conference considered, however, that these limits would not be sufficient to provide adequate compensation for claims likely to arise under the new HNS Convention and contemporaneously agreed the proposed protocol which would increase the limits.</P>
      <P>The effect of the Bill is to require Irish vessels everywhere and non-Irish vessels within a 200 miles nautical limit, in accordance with the terms of the HNS Convention, which are carrying hazardous and noxious substances, as defined, to carry compulsory insurance for the amount they may be liable to pay in compensation for any loss or damage caused by those substances. These are listed in the convention and include such materials as liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, oils and fats, combustible chemicals and solvents but excluding radioactive materials which are covered under a separate convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deliberate discharge of any of these materials into the sea is already a criminal offence under the Sea Pollution Acts, 1991-99. The Bill provides for enforcement by, among other, the Garda, the Defence Forces and harbourmasters. Penalties for non-compliance with the compulsory insurance requirements are, on summary <Col N="1116" /> conviction, a fine not exceeding £1,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both, or, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £1 million or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both. These penalties are similar to those set out in the sea pollution legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill extends Irish civil law jurisdiction to the matters covered by the convention and protocol so that parties here, including the State, can invoke the convention in the Irish courts in claiming compensation under it in the first instance from the shipowner and in the final analysis from an international fund operated by IMO and funded by a levy on imports of the materials in question into states which are party to the convention.</P>
    <P>A shipowner may limit his or her liability to the amount prescribed in the convention and fireproof his or her vessel against arrest by lodging security for that amount with the court. This amount varies according to the tonnage of the vessel but is, in any event, limited to about £110 million. Up to approximately £275 million is available in all under the proposed arrangements in respect of any one incident.</P>
    <P>The two-tier compensation arrangement mirrors that which applies to oil pollution. As with oil, contributions to the international fund are to be made by those who import the substances in question. On the basis of available information, it is not expected that contributions from Irish importers to the fund will be significant.</P>
    <P>The Bill is essentially technical in nature. The definitions and descriptions set out in the convention were agreed and adopted following consideration by experts at the International Maritime Organisation. Deputies will note that for ease of reference a copy of the HNS Convention is set out in Schedule 1 and the LLMC in Schedule 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill, however, must be viewed in the context of the legislative and other measures which have been introduced over the past 12 or so years and, in particular, since the Government came into office in 1997. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has adopted as a strategic goal the protection and preservation of the marine environment. Central to this strategy is the protection of the overall marine ecosystem, the maintenance of the highest standards in the quality of our marine waters, the prevention of pollution at sea and around our coasts and the provision of a rapid response to pollution incidents so as to minimise damage.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious that our legislation complies with accepted EU and international standards while addressing specific Irish concerns. The Government and the Department accordingly recognise that action at EU and international levels is an essential element of any strategy for the protection of the marine environment and, to that end, continues to participate fully in the activities of relevant organisations, including <Col N="1117" /> the International Maritime Organisation, the OSPAR Commission and the Bonn Convention.</P>
    <P>In December 1997, four sets of regulations were made under the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, to give effect to provisions of the IMO Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, namely MARPOL. Work is under way to adopt further provisions of MARPOL concerning the prevention of pollution from sewage from ships and the prevention of air pollution from ships.</P>
    <P>The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Act, 1998, was enacted in May 1998. The Act, one of those to which I referred earlier, strengthens the law in relation to oil pollution by bringing it in line with current international conventions. As with other instruments relating to maritime safety and the marine environment, these conventions are currently the subject of discussion and assessment at EU and international levels in the wake of the <i>Erika </i>incident which occurred off the coast of Brittany in December 1999. Measures have been agreed, or are under consideration, in relation to the regulation of ship classification societies, the accelerated phasing out of single hull oil tankers, the strengthening of port state control measures and ship reporting arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act, 1999, was enacted in June 1999. The Act gives effect in Irish law to the International Maritime Organisation's Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation (ORPC) Convention. Arrangements are in train to formally accede to the convention. The Act provides for the preparation of oil pollution emergency plans by harbour authorities and operators of offshore installations and oil handling facilities and their submission to the Minister for approval.</P>
    <P>The IMO in March 2000 adopted a protocol to OPRC providing for response measures similar to those for oil pollution to apply in respect of HNS. Work on a Bill to give effect to the protocol is to be initiated as soon as possible. The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic, OSPAR, came into force internationally in March 1988 following ratification by all the contracting parties.</P>
    <P>A major assessment of the status of the marine environment of the whole North East Atlantic was carried out by OSPAR and published in December 2000. The quality status report &ndash; QSR &ndash; describes the main impacts of human activities on the marine environment and evaluates the effectiveness of measures that have already been implemented to tackle those impacts. The publication of the report follows assessments which were carried out at national and regional levels in the past two years.</P>
    <P>For this purpose the OSPAR area was divided into five regions. Ireland and the UK were responsible in respect of preparing assessment for region III, known as the Celtic seas region. In the first instance Ireland prepared its own QSR. This involved several Departments and agencies and was published by the Marine Institute in 1999. <Col N="1118" /> The second stage involved a joint UK-Ireland QSR for the region. The final stage of the process involved fusion of all five regional reports into a single QSR for the entire area.</P>
    <P>The assessment found that the Irish marine environment was generally in a healthy state but that there was no room for complacency and that particular attention would need to be paid to the scale of coastal development, pollution from rivers, sewage treatment disposal and the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Byrne, Minister of State, serves along with his ministerial colleagues on the interdepartmental ministerial committee on nuclear safety. The Department's main area of concern at this forum relates to shipment of nuclear material by sea. In this regard, we continue to press for improvements to the irradiated nuclear fuel &ndash; INF &ndash; code at the International Maritime Organisation &ndash; IMO &ndash; and to agree effective bilateral arrangements for the notification of the passage of vessels carrying INF materials near our coasts with the states concerned, that is the UK, France and Japan.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the European Union in 1998 at Ireland's instigation adopted a directive requiring all vessels carrying such materials bound for or leaving a Community port to comply with strict notification procedures and controls. Regulations transposing the directive in question into Irish law were introduced in April 1999 as required under the terms of the directive even though such vessels do not use Irish ports or transit Irish territorial waters. The EU controls in question now apply to all vessels en route to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force on the dumping of radioactive materials in the maritime area was published in January 2000. The key conclusion of the report was that the risk to human health and to marine life from past radioactive dumping is extremely low and does not constitute a health hazard. The Government shares the concerns of many members of the public in this regard and is anxious that they should be allayed as far as possible. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland together with the universities are continuing with monitoring and other work in this sphere.</P>
    <P>In December 2000, the European Union adopted a directive on port reception facilities for ship generated waste and cargo residues. The purpose of the directive is to improve the availability and use of port reception facilities for such waste. Regulations will need to be introduced to give effect to the directive in Irish law by December 2002 and arrangements made for implementation.</P>
    <P>The OECD carried out an environmental performance review of Ireland during 1999. The principal aim of such reviews is to help OECD countries improve their individual and collective performance on environmental management. An interdepartmental working group was established by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to co-ordinate inputs from the different Departments affected. Material was fur<Col N="1119" /> nished and departmental officials attended as required at meetings with OECD representatives which took place in October 1999. The OECD report was launched by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in November 2000. As with the QSR the review expressed satisfaction with the Irish situation and the measures which had been introduced but advised that the situation required close ongoing monitoring and vigilance.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Bill, a diplomatic conference convened by the IMO adopted the HNS Convention in May 1996. The convention has not yet entered into force. It will not enter into force until 18 months after both of the following criteria have been fulfilled: at least 12 states must have expressed their consent to be bound by the convention, typically, through ratification or accession &ndash; this must include four states each with a registered fleet of at least 2 million units of gross tonnage, more than ten times the size of the Irish fleet and contributors in the states that have ratified or acceded to expressed their consent to be bound by the convention must, between them, receive a minimum of 40 million tonnes of contributing cargo covered by the general account.</P>
    <P>Periodically, informal meetings have been held to discuss the implementation of the HNS Convention. States attending these meetings agreed that it would be desirable to co-ordinate their ratification of the convention. EU member states at the Transport Council in December 2000 undertook to prepare the necessary legislation in this regard as soon as possible. I am committed to meeting this undertaking, not least to ensure, in view of the importance of our marine resource, that Ireland is in a position to benefit from the terms of the convention as soon as it comes into force.</P>
    <P>As has been emphasised in the recent studies to which I have referred, there is no room for complacency as far as the protection of the marine environment is concerned. We must continue to build on our achievements in order to get the full benefit of the measures we have introduced.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an important part of the process of advancement undertaken at national, EU and international level in order to protect the quality of the marine environment. I know that Deputies from all parties share this objective and I accordingly look forward to their comments.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am standing in for my colleague who is unavailable. I welcome the Bill and the Minister's comments in relation to improvements for protecting the marine environment. Being an island off Europe we would have to agree that many things have happened which were not helpful to the marine environment. That 14 countries have signed up to this convention is extremely important and worthwhile for the long-term effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> As the Minister said, the Bill is complicated. However, I wish to raise a few points to which I hope he will reply. He said the Bill provides for enforcement by, among others, the Garda, the Defence Forces and the harbourmasters. What is the cost to the State? Is there any contribution from those who have ships on the seas transporting hazardous waste, other waste and hazardous material which can cause serious damage?</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's contribution that his colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Hugh Byrne, serves on the interdepartmental ministerial committee on nuclear safety. The Minister informed us of the position on transport to Sellafield. Are there any guarantees regarding the transport to Sellafield, which is located across the east coast? Is the Minister happy with the plans and with the conditions shippers are supposed to adhere to when handling this cargo? I welcome the report, referred to by the Minister, on the safety implications following the damage done from dumping at sea. However, can its findings be taken fully on board? Many comments have been made on the damage to marine life.</P>
    <P>With regard to the strategy adopted to protect the environment and given the ongoing discussions, can improvements be made on a continuous basis, even above what is in place at present? Is the Minister happy with the current guarantees and the proposals regarding protection and prevention? The Minister and his predecessor have repeatedly said that further work is required in this area and more improvements are needed, including additional care and controls, to ensure that the marine life, not only around Ireland but across the world, is duly protected.</P>
    <P>When was the funding allocated to implement the convention? Will it be shared by the 12 states who are party to it or will the EU provide a substantial allocation of funds to assist in ensuring that the protection required is provided? There is provision to impose substantial fines for breaking the law. How many different companies have breached the rules and regulations set down by the convention? Is every vessel on the seas checked before it leaves or arrives at port? What is the mechanism for ensuring that the regulations in place are adhered to? Is it done before or after ships come into our waters?</P>
    <P>The proposals must be welcomed by all who work around our coasts. How is it proposed to inform them of what has been agreed in the convention and how this legislation will affect them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter. It is extraordinary that two of the 40 schools named by the INTO this week as being substandard are <Col N="1121" /> located in County Waterford. It is even more extraordinary that the two schools in question, Cappoquinn convent primary school and Cappoquinn boys' national school are both in the same town of Cappoquinn, with a population of approximately 1,000 people. The catchment area includes Turreen and Melleray.</P>
      <P>The board of management of both schools first met in 1991 to discuss the future and the new amalgamated school was sanctioned in 1994. The new school is to consist of at least eight classrooms, with the possibility of an additional classroom. The girls' school has 120 pupils while the boys' school has 70. The local contribution for the new school is in place, as is the site.</P>
      <P>The convent primary school is in two parts, with a row of classrooms of St. Anne's post primary school between them. The main two storey building dates back to 1904 while the infants are housed in a pre-fabricated building. There is a steep sloped avenue between the two parts of the school and there is no proper playing area for the children except for some small tarmacadamed areas. I understand that recently a girl in a wheelchair had to attend another school as the school is wheelchair inaccessible.</P>
      <P>Part of the boys' school dates back to the early 1940s while another part constitutes a pre-cast concrete building of the early 1970s. The windows are rotten and the heating system is inadequate. There is a concrete playing area about the size of a basketball court. The rest of the play area, part of which is an embankment, is a quagmire today following rain.</P>
      <P>The INTO has described the 40 substandard schools it has listed as being a totally unacceptable situation and has warned it will not allow it to continue. I understand that following communication of acceptance of revisions to the brief by the board of management, the Department will be writing to the school authorities by the end of the week.</P>
      <P>Some 5% of the substandard schools on the INTO list are located in Cappoquinn and 190 pupils are involved. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. The Celtic tiger is failing the primary school, teachers and children in Cappoquinn. Bearing in mind all the unacceptable features involved I call on the Minister to fast track the processing of the submissions in relation to the new amalgamated school project and to make every possible contribution to taking the children attending primary school in Cappoquinn, and their teachers, away from the present grossly unsuitable situation to a new school worthy of the new millennium at the earliest possible date. Cappoquinn has waited for far too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy O'Shea for raising this important matter and I thank him for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding accommodation for the proposed new primary school at Cappoquin, County Waterford. The <Col N="1122" /> Department of Education and Science has agreed to provide a new school on a green field site which will accommodate Cappoquinn girls' and boys' amalgamated schools. At present the Cappoquinn girls' national school has a staffing of a principal teacher and four mainstream class teachers. The boys' national school has a staffing of a principal teacher and two mainstream class teachers. Both schools share a remedial teacher who is based at Cappoquinn boys' national school. The accommodation brief for the new school has been increased to eight classrooms with appropriate ancillary accommodation.</P>
      <P>A decision on whether a ninth classroom should be included in the final brief will be made at a later stage having regard to factors such as the growth of enrolments, demographic trends and housing developments. However, this will not delay the progress of architectural planning. The planning and building unit of the Department is currently examining the initial architectural designs for this project. Officials from the Department's building unit will be in contact with the board of management as soon as this examination has been completed.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the concerns of the school authorities in this matter and I assure the Deputy and the House that it is the intention of the Department of Education and Science to provide adequate accommodation for the future needs of Cappoquin as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to current conditions at the schools, I should point out that all primary schools are given an annual allocation of £3,000 plus £10 per pupil which can be used entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues relating to the school infrastructure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue for my constituents in Dublin South East.</P>
      <P>It concerns the cutbacks in the 13B bus which services, in particular, the Rathmines and Ranelagh areas. The downgrading of this route has accelerated over the past number of years to the point now where the route is wholly inadequate and unattractive for those who are forced to use public transport and those conscientious individuals who would like to leave their cars at home. I recall when I lived in Palmerstown Road in 1977 that the No. 12 route provided an excellent service for commuters. It strikes me as bizarre that almost a quarter of a century later, when our capital city is gridlocked, when our air is seriously polluted by car fumes and when car numbers are growing exponentially, Dublin Bus has decided to cut back on this essential service. Of course, the less frequent the service, the fewer people will actually use it, which means that Dublin Bus will cut back even further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997, Dublin Bus decided the route should stop in the city centre and cut down on the num<Col N="1123" /> ber of buses it was using. At the time I objected to this move and was informed in a letter dated 17 October, 1997 from Donal Keating, divisional manager, North Summerhill Garage, as follows, &ldquo;contrary to some rumours, buses will continue to operate during off peak and evening times though with less frequency than heretofore.&rdquo; It is clear that the rumours were not unfounded and that people's suspicions were correct because the present timetable shows that off peak buses are a thing of the past. There is now no service between 10.20 a.m. and 15.40 p.m. from Palmerstown Park and the last bus leaves at 16.20 p.m. The service has essentially been gutted. It is becoming clearer to me that Dublin Bus intends, if possible and if allowed, to stop completely the service some time in the future. I hope it does not have the temerity to restate this is just a rumour. There is a distinct pattern, a twisted logic to the strategy. It is the logic of the bottom line, forced upon it by a Government with a McCreevyite vision of the world. The individual car owner comes first and public transport for a better society comes a very poor second.</P>
    <P>Contrast this attitude to more progressive societies where public transport is valued, promoted and subsidised because it contributes to a better society. The attitude of the Government is reprehensible. It is very much a hands off attitude because it is very difficult to get answers on specific questions relating to bus routes &ndash; I can only talk in general terms &ndash; and I believe that what is required here is a little bit of imagination. If numbers are falling on certain routes, surely we should use Imp buses on those routes and encourage people to use public transport because people are desperately seeking alternatives. To use a car in Dublin city at the moment is no joy. More and more people would use that bus if it were reliable and comfortable. We have many years experience of the success of the DART. The Government has really promoted the car culture because the investment in roads is much greater than the investment in public transport. It was stated in a parliamentary reply that investment in 1997 was £7 million and in 1999 it was in excess of £13 million. However, that does not take into account the requirements which are very real. We need not just a good service but an excellent service.</P>
    <P>During the summer I had an opportunity to visit Helsinki where, incidentally, the Greens are the second biggest party. It was a revelation because not only were there cycleways all over the city, there was an excellent public transport service and people did not have to use their cars. This Government is forcing people into a situation where they must use their cars. I want to see a situation in this city where people will have excellent public transport and where the 13B bus and the No. 3 bus which services Ringsend will be services of which people can be proud and will use.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to communicate with Dublin Bus. I do not want him to tell <Col N="1124" /> me this is a matter for Dublin Bus. Someone must be answerable and I would like answers to the questions I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gormley for raising this important issue.</P>
      <P>As my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, has said many times before, this Government is serious about improving public transport services both in Dublin and throughout the country. It is committed to spending £2.2 billion on the enhancement of the public transport system over the lifetime of the National Development Plan. Some £120 million of this will be provided to increase the capacity and improve the quality, reliability, frequency and speed of bus services in the Dublin region.</P>
      <P>In 1999, Bus Átha Cliath acquired 150 additional buses with Exchequer and EU support. This was a first for both the Exchequer and the EU. These additional buses were utilised to provide increased capacity and frequency on many routes, especially at peak hours. Last year Bus Átha Cliath purchased 225 new buses, all low floor and wheelchair accessible. Some 125 of these buses were additions to the fleet and the remaining 100 were replacement buses. The purchase of these additional buses has increased the company's core fleet from approximately 900 buses in 1997 to 1,100 at the end of 2000. This has resulted in increased capacity of approximately 20,000 places during that period.</P>
      <P>Four quality bus corridors are also now in operation and have proved to be a great success. The Stillorgan corridor, in particular, has been an outstanding success, with a 196% increase in peak hour passenger numbers. Two-thirds of new customers were previous car users. Bus journey times on all four corridors were reduced by up to 40% and bus journeys are between 30% and 50% quicker than equivalent car journeys. Construction work on a further five corridors is nearing completion and they will be introduced on a phased basis in the coming months.</P>
      <P>A very successful and substantially expanded Nitelink service was launched by Bus Átha Cliath prior to Christmas 2000. This enhanced service proved to be a spectacular success. Just short of 240,000 passengers were carried on Nitelink between 30 November 2000 and 6 January 2001. This compares with a figure of 38,000 passengers carried by Nitelink in December 1991, its first year of service. The provision of the enhanced Nitelink service has been continued by Bus Átha Cliath into 2001 for six nights each week.</P>
      <P>The Government has also increased substantially the amount of subvention paid to the CIE companies for the provision of socially necessary but non-commercial services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2001 the Government will provide £159 million in Exchequer subvention for CIE. This is 51% more than was provided for in the 1997 Estimates. The Deputy may be aware that the allocation of this subvention to the individual subsidi<Col N="1125" /> ary companies is a matter for the board of CIE. However, I understand that last year the board allocated £13.439 million from a total of £115.2 million to Bus Átha Cliath. This represents a 92% increase on the amount allocated to Bus Átha Cliath in 1997.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can see the results of this increased investment on the streets of Dublin every day. The new buses are improving the image of public transport in the city and thus encouraging commuters to switch from their cars to buses.</P>
    <P>Bus Átha Cliath in any particular area, whether in Dublin South East or elsewhere, aims to provide services in line with demand and such day to day operational matters are the responsibility of the board of the company. The Minister for Public Enterprise has no function in these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this important issue. I wish to extend my deep sympathy to the Minister for Public Enterprise and her family on the sad death of her husband, Enda.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the crisis that has already developed in respect of public transport in north County Dublin. I refer here in particular to the rail network. The problem of chronic overcrowding on trains is causing grief, stress and frustration for commuters. At peak periods, commuters, including young children, are being literally squeezed on to trains. Some expectant mothers bring their own seats on to trains. Incidents of people fainting and being removed are regular occurrences on trains, which people refer to as &ldquo;sardine expresses&rdquo;. This is a scandalous situation and it reflects the lack of commitment of successive Governments to public transport.</P>
      <P>The net effect of this problem is that the people of Fingal and commuters on the rail system throughout the greater Dublin area are suffering a deterioration in the quality of their lives and this does not even begin to reflect the implications of the Government's strategic planning guidelines for the area, which are being driven by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. These guidelines propose the construction of an additional 253,000 dwellings in the greater Dublin area between now and 2011. Furthermore, it is proposed that there will be an additional 18,500 dwellings built along the Fingal rail corridor between now and 2006. This does not take into consideration proposed industrial developments in the same area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plans to extensively transform the towns of Balbriggan, Lusk, Rush, Donabate, Malahide, Portmarnock and Baldoyle, which are situated adjacent to the rail corridor to which I refer, must take account of the shortcomings in the transportation network, otherwise we will be faced with a planning and social disaster. For example, it is estimated that there will be a fourfold increase in the population of Balbriggan in the next ten <Col N="1126" /> years. All current applications in respect of the town refer to sustainable development and an adequate public transport system being available. The position with regard to Lusk and Donabate is similar.</P>
    <P>Transportation infrastructure, particularly as it relates to public transport, is a vital component in any consideration of such radical proposals and should also be considered in light of the fact that we are unable to meet our current requirements. I am reliably informed that in 2003 additional carriages will become available and this will bring the number in use up to the maximum which can be used at peak periods. However, this will only provide an additional 2000 places on our trains in 2003. That is the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that the Government is seriously considering the urgency of the infrastructural needs of north Dublin and ways to address them. An Irish Rail document, Platform for Change, 2000-2016, identified these shortcomings and refers to the need to upgrade the rail network between Connolly Station and Pearse Station. The maximum number of trains are using that corridor at present and no additional trains can use it. I understand that a further three or four tracks need to be provided between Connolly Station and Howth Junction.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that progress has been made. However, unless these matters are given far greater priority in terms of the development programme, we will be faced with a disaster. There will be further congestion on the roads because the public transport system will not be able to cater for the needs of those who will live in the new housing developments to which I refer. We must act now.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will have in his possession a written reply which was provided by his officials. Notwithstanding what it says, I must inform him that, in conjunction with colleagues from my constituency, I have met the people from the area and they brought to my attention the real problems that exist. Further development is required, as a matter or priority. I ask the Minister of State to communicate my views to the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise has no statutory function in relation to operational matters which are a day to day function of the board of Iarnród Éireann. However, Iarnród Éireann informed her that it introduced a new DART service to Malahide in mid-December last, following the placing into service of ten additional DART carriages. As a consequence, a revised timetable for all services on northern suburban lines was <Col N="1127" /> introduced. Following the introduction of the new timetable, the Minister received numerous complaints from Iarnród Éireann customers. She raised these with the company and was informed that there are capacity constraints in relation to the frequency of trains which can safely use the rail track network on the northern suburban rail line into the city centre. The maximum safety limit on this line is 12 trains per track per hour.</P>
    <P>To accommodate the DART service to Malahide, Iarnród Éireann informed her that it had to reschedule its services to and from Drogheda and Howth. To offset the impact of the changes in the schedule, some DART trains have been increased from four to six carriages, thus providing extra capacity. This position will improve further when an additional 16 new DART carriages are commissioned. In the meantime, additional drivers will have been recruited and trained which will enhance reliability. In all there will be an increase of almost 30% DART capacity compared with November last.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has advised the Minister that it has experienced a 15% to 20% increase in passenger carryings since the new timetable was introduced, but acknowledges that there has been a degree of inconvenience to some customers. In response, it has met local public representatives, groups and customers to consider ways of addressing the concerns raised. I understand it is now planning some further adjustments to timetables for these customers in response to their concerns and that these should be announced shortly. Iarnród Éireann also acknowledges the need for better communications with its customers when changes in service are introduced and in the event of disruption. It is committed to <Col N="1128" /> a renewed customer focus as developments take place in these services in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>Enhanced capacity will be provided for customers on the northern line over the coming months. To cater for general growth in demand for these services in the coming years, the national development plan provides for a further 12 new DART carriages to be delivered to Iarnród Éireann in the last quarter of this year which, when operational in late spring 2002, will increase the capacity of DART services by over 40% in the period since last November.</P>
    <P>In addition, Iarnród Éireann has an option on a further 36 new DART carriages. Iarnród Éireann has also ordered 60 new diesel Arrow carriages which are due for delivery in 2002 and 2003 to be financed under the national development plan. These new carriages will be used to provide increased capacity on northern suburban rail services by allowing a lengthening of suburban trains. Iarnród Éireann has separately contracted for a further 20 Arrow carriages.</P>
    <P>All northern suburban rail platforms, apart from those in DART stations, can accommodate eight-carriage trains. Plans are in hand to extend all DART platforms to accommodate eight-carriage trains. Plans are also at an advanced stage in Iarnród Éireann for a major investment project to increase the frequency of trains on the northern suburban rail network by providing enhanced signalling, eight-car trains, improved power supply on overhead power lines and the upgrading of the current two-track system to three tracks.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked Iarnród Éireann to accelerate the submission to her of all its proposals for the upgrading of services on the northern suburban line.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 6 February 2001.</P>

      <Quest>the number of additional teachers his Department estimates will be required to meet all educational needs over the next five years; and the steps he is taking to reach these targets.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2762/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The accurate projection of the supply and demand for teachers required at primary level is dependent on a range of factors.  </P>
      <P>The demand for teachers is affected by the number of teaching posts created by the Government; demand for substitute teachers; the number of teachers opting to take career breaks and job-share; the age at which teachers opt to retire on a voluntary basis and a number of secondments approved.</P>
      <P>Since taking office this Government has increased demand for teachers generally by creating an extra 1,875 posts to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and increase support for children with a disability or disadvantage. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness this Government has approved the allocation of a further nine hundred posts to be allocated during the lifetime of the programme. The allocation of these posts will create further demand for teaching posts. In addition, the allocation of resource posts on the basis of need will increase the demand in the next five years.</P>
      <P>This Government, in the current school year, has implemented a new scheme to enable teaching principals be released from their teaching duties for a certain number of days annually to undertake administrative, leadership and management functions. The introduction of this scheme and the provision of substitute cover to cover for principals availing of the release time has increased the demand for substitute teachers.</P>
      <P>Teachers are appointed by boards of management of the individual schools and the boards are responsible for approving career breaks, job-sharing and secondments. Accordingly, the decision of boards to either grant or refuse an application for leave of absence under these schemes will ultimately affect the demand for teachers.</P>
      <P>While the demand for the number of teachers has increased arising from the introduction of initiatives to reduce the PTR and allocate additional posts to deal with disadvantage and disabilities, this Government has boosted substantially the supply of trained primary teachers to deal with the additional demand. The intake to the colleges of education for primary teaching in the 1999-2000 academic year was 1,283. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> There are 1,000 students enrolled in the first year of the undergraduate training course in the 2000-01 academic year. It is projected that the intake will continue at 1,000 annually for a number of years. However, these projections will be reviewed on an ongoing basis taking account of enrolment trends and changes in demand requirements.</P>
    <P>As a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers, my Department requested the colleges of education to provide postgraduate courses to enable degree holders to train as primary teachers. The duration of the post graduate full-time course is 18 months. Eligible post primary teachers may apply for this course in the normal way. These courses were provided in the 1997/98, 1998/99 and 1999/2000 academic years. A further postgraduate course will commence this month with an intake of 280 students.</P>
    <P>Between the 2000 and 2001 academic years it is projected that approximately 1,900 qualified primary teachers will graduate from the colleges of education. This represents a huge increase in the number of trained graduates as compared with 1995 when 291 graduated.</P>
    <P>It is projected that 1,280 qualified primary teachers will graduate in 2002. At second level, the Deputy will be aware that an additional 1,000 posts have been created in the current school year. A proportion of these posts have been utilised to facilitate the reduction in the pupil teacher ratio for appointment purposes from 19:1 to 18:1. The balance has been targeted at particular programmes such as the leaving certificate applied, the junior certificate school programme and the stay in school retention initiative. A further 200 posts will be allocated in each of the next two school years in accordance with the provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>These posts, together with the introduction in all second level schools, from September 1999, of enrolment based allocations for remedial teaching and the retention within the system of posts that would otherwise be lost due to falling enrolments, have resulted in the national PTR in the second level sector falling, from just over 16:1 when this Government came into office, to just over 15:1 in the current school year.</P>
    <P>The teacher supply and demand issue at second level is very complex. Analyses undertaken by my Department in 1997 indicated that there are regional and subject variations. Schools in certain locations have more difficulties in recruitment while specific subjects, especially Irish, may pose particular difficulties. A further complicating factor is that vacancies in second level schools usually require specific subject combinations.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Higher Education Authority have been monitoring the situation carefully. The total number of places on the Higher Diploma in Education course has increased by 25% since 1997-98. Quotas were set aside in 1998 for specific subjects including Irish. The Department and the Higher Education Authority are continuing to review the supply of <Col N="1131" /> and demand for second level teachers on an ongoing basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In May last year the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000 (Statutory Instrument 125 of 2000) gave effect to the most recent revision of the EURATOM Basic Safety Standards Directive (Council Directive 96/29/EURATOM). This sets a national reference level for radon in workplaces of 400 bqMf7&gt;3 over any three month period. If radon exceeds this level an employer must evaluate whether remedial measures should be undertaken and, if so, such measures should be undertaken as soon as is practicable.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of the pilot study in question is to establish whether passive ventilation systems can be used to mitigate radon levels in schools with radon levels in a range between 200 and 400 bequerels per cubic metre, as opposed to the active mitigation systems that have been, or will be, installed in the schools with higher levels.</P>
      <P>The study has not yet been fully completed as the building research establishment is awaiting data from one participating school. It is envisaged that the report will be available to my Department very shortly.</P>
      <P>Mitigation measures are complete in thirteen of the worst affected schools that participated in phase I of the survey. Preliminary post mitigation testing indicates that the measures taken have been effective. Average radon levels of below 200 bqMf7&gt;3 have been recorded in all of the rooms in these schools during the three-month test period. Contracts have been placed to carry out remedial work in a further 20 schools from phase I. Some of this work is under way at present and all of the systems should be in place by the end of the Easter break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RPII advised that 23 of the worst affected schools that participated in phase II should be given priority when mitigation arrangements were being made. An expert in radon mitigation from Cornwall County Council, who provided the specifications for mitigation systems for the worst affected schools from Phase I, has visited ten of these 23 schools in order to specify mitigation systems for these schools. He will visit the remaining thirteen school when he returns to Ireland in March and June this year. The specifications will <Col N="1132" /> be available to enable the systems to be installed by the summer of this year at the very latest, although it may be possible to install some systems earlier.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are to be made to have remedial work carried out in approximately 51 other schools with maximum radon levels in one or more rooms in a range between 404 bqMf7&gt;3 and 656 bqMf7&gt;3. It is hoped that more local expertise can be found to specify the remedial measures necessary in these schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme of asbestos elimination in primary and post-primary schools has progressed well since it began in 1999, taking into consideration that the testing and removal procedures are quite complex and have to be undertaken by specially qualified personnel in accordance with strictly enforced procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1999, my Department requested the Office of Public Works to undertake a pilot survey of 196 schools in the south-east of the country to determine the location, type, form and con<Col N="1133" /> dition of any asbestos material present and the steps necessary to manage the problem. The intention of my Department in conducting the sample survey was to obtain information on the likely scale and extent of the presence of asbestos in school buildings. The initial survey was completed in July 1999 by a firm of specialist consultants commissioned by the Office of Public Works. It identified an asbestos presence in some form or another in 59 of the 196 schools surveyed, that is, about 30%.</P>
    <P>Although generally speaking the condition of the material was found to be good and posed no immediate health risk, its removal where possible was recommended and a programme of works was commenced immediately with funding made available from my Department.</P>
    <P>In December 1999, the initial survey was extended to all schools nationwide, primary and post-primary, and the management authorities and principals of every school were informed of the details of the survey procedures. Following on this phase, a programme of works was undertaken in schools where asbestos was identified. At this stage, approximately 1,500 out of a total of just under 4,000 schools have been tested and remediation works have been carried out in over 200 of these.</P>
    <P>Where asbestos requiring removal is detected, either as a result of the survey or otherwise, arrangements are made to undertake the work in accordance with the relevant health and safety legislation by my Department and the Office of Public Works. The entire cost of the programme of detection and removal is being borne by my Department. Total expenditure in 2000 on the asbestos remediation programme in schools was £6.3 million.</P>
    <P>The next major phase of the removal programme is currently being prepared and work will take place during the summer when schools are closed. My Department will continue to make available the necessary level of finance to maintain the current rate of progress. Although exact figures will only be available when the programme for 2001 is ready, it is likely that expenditure this year will exceed that for 2000 due to an increase in the number of schools being dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 78 psychologists serving with the national educational psychological service. This reflects a welcome expansion, as 28 of these have been appointed since the beginning of September 2000 and it is intended to appoint up to 21 more psychologists before the end of the current school year. In addition, I intend to proceed with the recruitment of an additional 25 psychologists during this calendar year.</P>
      <P>In order to provide a full and effective psychological service, it is essential that each psychologist should be allocated a realistic number of schools to serve. It is clear, therefore, that expansion of the NEPS service to all schools must occur in a phased and orderly manner. Most of the newly appointed psychologists have now been assigned to schools. The final list of additional schools that will now have access to NEPS is being prepared and will be available to me for my approval before the end of the month. As each psychologist is appointed, more schools will be added to the list. Recruitment to NEPS will continue until a full complement of educational psychologists has been reached and all schools have access to the service.</P>
      <P>However, I recognise the need for some schools and parents to be able to gain access to psychological assessments in situations where a national educational psychological service psychologist has not yet been appointed, or has had to take a career break.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> I have asked NEPS to develop proposals aimed at alleviating such situations until the time when it will have achieved its full staffing complement. This is being addressed as a matter of urgency and I understand that these proposals are practically ready for my consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The decision of 3 October 2000 referred to by the Deputy, was a decision in principle to establish a compensation scheme for certain survivors of abuse. It was always expected that the preparation of detailed provisions for the scheme would take some time. This work is, however, being undertaken as a matter of priority by my Department, not least, as the Deputy points out, considering the age of many of those concerned. However, this is an area of considerable complexity, involving as it does a range of legal and non-legal issues, and more importantly, the Government's desire to ensure that any compensation scheme will be effective in meeting the needs of survivors. Officials of my Department, and of the Attorney General's office are at present preparing proposals, which take account of consultations with the interested parties. I intend to present detailed proposals for the establishment of a compensation body to Government for their approval within the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding to establish a compensation scheme for survivors of abuse, the Government decided it should be directed at those persons who as children were abused in institutions in which they were resident and for which the State had significant regulatory or supervisory responsibility. The basis for this decision is that the children concerned were separated from their parents and, therefore, did not have the care and protection which children in the care of their parents enjoy. They relied to a significant extent on public bod<Col N="1136" /> ies to protect them and it is now all too clear that, notwithstanding that duty, children were abused. These considerations do not apply to children who were resident with their families while at school.</P>

Almost 75% of primary schools responded to the survey with completed survey questionnaires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> A number of accepted socio-economic variables were used to compute an index of disadvantage for each school surveyed. These variables included unemployment, medical card possession and residence in local authority housing which have been found in the past to be valid indicators of disadvantage at school level. Separate indices were used for rural and urban schools to reflect the findings of previous research that showed that educational disadvantage manifests itself differently in urban and rural locations.</P>
    <P>Participating schools were ranked in order of the number of disadvantaged pupils enrolled.</P>
    <P>The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need and the findings form the basis of the new programme which I announced earlier this month to tackle educational disadvantage at primary level. The programme involves expenditure of £26 million over a three year period including the allocation of over 200 new teacher posts and supplementary funding to primary schools with concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. The additional supports must be targeted at the disadvantaged pupils in each school. The programme has both an urban and rural phase and the allocation of resources on a 3:1 basis between the two is consistent with the survey finding in relation to the distribution of educationally disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    <P>All of the schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the new programme. Almost 2,300 primary schools will benefit under the programme based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the schools as identified through the ERC survey. Details of the schools eligible for assistance under the programme have been published.</P>
    <P>Resources under the programme have not been allocated to schools from which a response to the survey was not received before the end of August 2000. A number of issues in relation to the survey and the new programme will be the subject of ongoing research and investigation during the coming months and late responses and the issues of schools that did not respond will be included in those considerations.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on the demonstration programme on education disadvantage established in 1996 by the Combat Poverty Agency; if he has received a final report in respect of the demonstration programme; if he has considered this report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A final report in respect of the demonstration programme has not yet been received by <Col N="1138" /> me. However, the approach used in the Combat Poverty Agency's demonstration programme &ndash; an inter-agency approach which brought together a consortium of interests whose collective expertise can address the needs of the target group in an integrated way &ndash; correlates very closely with my own policies and approach to tackling educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Education can be a powerful force in promoting the opportunity for every person to develop to his or her full potential. There are strong links between poor educational achievement and leaving school without certification on the one hand and subsequent unemployment or under-employment on the other. Consequently, targeting supports at young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving is a priority issue for the Government.</P>
      <P>The key principles underlying my Department's approach to countering educational disadvantage are: prevention, early intervention, targeting, individual needs identification, parental involvement and development, positive discrimination, curricular adaptation, methodological adaptation, in school and out of school services, mentoring, allocation of resources to schools subject to specific conditions, the integrated delivery of the services of local statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>These principles underpin the new programme for pupils in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds and &ldquo;Stay in School&rdquo; retention at second level which incorporates learning about the importance of integrated services from the 8-15 early school leaver initiative.</P>
      <P>Additional programmes include second chance programmes through Youthreach, VTOS and senior traveller training centres, adult literacy/adult and community education programmes, third level access programmes and youth services. Legislative underpinning for this work is provided by the Education Act, 1998, and the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy schoolbags. The terms of reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy school bags and in particular: the extent of the problem; the factors which contribute to the problem; and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils.</P>
      <P>The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998.</P>
      <P>The group's report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers. One of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, my Department, at primary and post-primary levels, initiated an awareness raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-<Col N="1140" /> primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools, highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suitable to its individual needs.</P>
    <P>The report also recommended that my Department should examine the feasibility of providing for appropriate storage facilities in future specifications for furniture manufacturers. Accordingly, the building unit of my Department will be examining the possibility of incorporating storage facilities in the provision of furniture in the future. The report further recommended that, in relation to second level schools, my Department should continue to afford schools the option of book storage in the case of new schools.</P>
    <P>In light of the actions already taken by my Department, particularly the dissemination of the report of the working group to all schools as part of an awareness raising initiative, I do not consider that any further action is required at this time.</P>

      <P>In the case of primary schools, the new planning guidelines in operation for all new building projects since January 2000 make provision for general purposes areas ranging from 91 square metres to 200 square metres, depending on the size of the school.</P>
      <P>Where an application is made for major capital improvement works by the management authorities of an existing school, it is the policy of my Department to assess the overall future accommodation needs of the school. If the site is sufficiently large, a general purposes area is included in the planning brief, even when this may not have been the subject of the initial application.</P>
      <P>Because general purposes rooms are included as part of the overall schedule of accommodation for primary building projects and are not dealt with in isolation, there are no readily available figures relating to the volume of applications and approvals in respect of these facilities.</P>
      <P>Concerning second level schools, it is the policy of my Department to provide a PE hall in all new schools, and in extensions to existing schools where the facility is not available. The size of the hall to be provided varies between 604 Mf7&gt;2 and 806 Mf7&gt;2 depending on enrolment.</P>
      <P>The building unit of my Department is in the process of preparing a PE hall template that will standardise the construction of PE halls in post-primary schools generally.

      <P>Until the beginning of this year, the National Educational Psychological Service Agency of my Department deployed one educational psychologist in primary schools in County Mayo, serving 30 primary schools. Two additional psychologists, who will work in both primary and post-primary schools, have now joined the NEPS team in the county. One of these psychologists will also be deployed initially part-time in County Roscommon but will eventually work exclusively in County Mayo. It is intended <Col N="1142" /> to extend the NEPS service to approximately 30 more schools during the current school term.</P>
      <P>The most recent statistical report of my Department indicates that there are 192 primary schools in the county. This includes special schools, some of whom have access to psychological services provided by the relevant health board and voluntary bodies. This means that approximately 130 schools do not yet have access to the NEPS service. However, it is envisaged that there will be six psychologists serving all schools in County Mayo by the end of the expansion phase of NEPS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department supports the view that good nutrition is central to a child's educational development. Evidence from existing studies shows that there is a significant positive relationship between improved dietary status and school performance. Research suggests that providing school meals is associated with improved school attendance, decreased tardiness and an improvement in children's cognitive functioning and academic achievement.</P>
      <P>A knowledge of what constitutes a nutritionally balanced diet is acknowledged as being of importance for students. To support this, nutrition education is featured across the curriculum in post primary schools. Healthy eating is included in the physical health module of the social, personal and health programme, which is taught to all classes in junior cycle. Within home economics, which is taken by approximately one third of the junior cycle cohort, food and nutrition constitutes 40% of the programme with significant emphasis being placed on the links between food and health. Food composition and food nutrients are also included in the junior certificate science programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs engaged consultants to carry out a review of the school meals scheme, which was completed in 1998. A working group comprising representatives from the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Finance, Health and Children, Environment and Local Government and my Department was subsequently set up to evaluate the scheme. This group is currently examining the scope for alternative policy and organisational approaches, which might result in a more efficient and effective operation of the <Col N="1143" /> scheme. It is expected that the group will have completed its work before the end of this year. Until the group has completed its review and presented its report, I am not in a position to state whether the scheme is currently operating with optimum effectiveness from an educational point of view.</P>

    <P>I understand that the Irish folklore collection is housed in the arts building in Belfield and is accessible to scholars and members of the general public each afternoon, Monday to Friday, except for the month of August. Major parts of the Department's collection are also available on microfilm at various third-level institutions in Ireland. I further understand that it would not be feasible to make the main manuscripts collection available to the various county libraries. However, microfilm copies of the locally relevant material from the schools' collection, which is <Col N="1144" /> accessible on a county basis, have been supplied to the local county libraries.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I believe that the existing arrangements for accessing the collections of the Folklore Commission are satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I have maintained contact with the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland and all the other partners in education throughout the current dispute. In addition, officials from my Department and the Department of Finance have recently been involved in discussions with the facilitator, Mr Tom Pomphrett. Following those discussions a proposal was issued by Mr. Pomphrett which has been accepted by both parties. A process has been agreed which will involve both parties requesting the Labour Court, acting on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, to examine the ASTI claim in respect of teachers pay and the position of the Government in relation to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and public service pay policy and to make recommendations to the parties for the resolution of the dispute. This process will get under way very shortly and in the circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment on any matters in relation to the dispute.</P>

      <P>The uptake of leaving certificate biology has remained fairly constant at approximately 50% of the cohort while the uptake of agricultural science has increased somewhat, albeit from a fairly low base. The uptake of the physical sciences, on the other hand, has been decreasing for some time.</P>
      <P>The following initiatives to increase the uptake of the physical science subjects at leaving certificate are being implemented.</P>
      <P>Last December, I established a task force on the uptake of the physical sciences at both second and third level. The membership of the task force is representative of a wide range of stakeholders and is chaired by Dr. Danny O'Hare, former President of Dublin City University. Two meetings of the task force have already taken place and the positions of science strategy co-ordinators are currently being filled. The brief of the task force is to identify the issues contributing to the falling uptake of the physical sciences and to recommend additional measures to address these issues. The work of the task force will range across both second and third level and will also interact with industry, thus providing insights for students into the many courses and careers that are available to them as a result of a study of the physical sciences.</P>
      <P>Revised syllabi in leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry were introduced in September 2000 for first examination in June 2002. As well as the addition of new, up-to-date content, these syllabi have an increased emphasis on practical work and on the interface between science, technology and society. These changes are intended to highlight for students the relevance of these subjects to their everyday lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new format of examination paper in ordinary level junior certificate science was introduced in the 2000 examination. In leaving certificate physics and chemistry the structure and layout of questions on the ordinary level papers has been revised. These changes have been designed to make these examination papers more accessible <Col N="1146" /> to the cohort of candidates for whom they are intended.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive in-career development programme for teachers of physics and chemistry was put in place in September 1999 and is designed to run for three years. During the first year of the programme a total of two and a half days of in-service training was provided for teachers of physics and for teachers of chemistry. The programme is continuing in the current school year with a particular emphasis on practical work. The programme has received a very enthusiastic response from teachers and will make a major contribution to reinvigorating the teaching of these subjects at both junior and senior level.</P>
    <P>The in-career development programme includes the provision of support materials for teachers. In addition to these materials, my Department has produced comprehensive reference handbooks in both physics and chemistry and has distributed them to all second level schools. These handbooks have been provided in both printed and CD-ROM formats. In addition to the copies sent to schools, individual teachers are being provided with further copies of the CD as part of the in-career development programme. These materials have a particular emphasis on practical work and on the interface between science, technology and society and so will provide teachers with additional insights into the relevance and applications of these subjects to the daily lives of their students.</P>
    <P>Additional grants for the purchase of laboratory equipment, including ICT equipment, are being provided to schools. These grants amounted to in excess of £7 million in the year 2000. This resulted in a grant of approximately £10,500 to each school providing one or more physical science subjects.</P>
    <P>A special annual <i>per capita</i> grant of £10 for pupils taking leaving certificate physics and leaving certificate chemistry has been introduced.</P>
    <P>A revised structure for the junior certificate science syllabus is under consideration by an NCCA course committee. This revision is giving particular attention to the physics and chemistry content of the course. It is proposed that the revised syllabus will be implemented by September 2002.</P>

      <P>Swimming is part of the aquatics strand of the revised primary curriculum. The term &ldquo;aquatics&rdquo; is used to include not only the teaching of swimming but the provision of opportunities for enjoyment of water play. The aquatics programme is designed for implementation at any <Col N="1147" /> class level having regard to the availability of a local facility and the readiness of pupils to begin water based activities. Where a local facility exists, I am very much in favour of swimming being taught to pupils as part of the aquatics programme.</P>
      <P>In addition, I introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools last year. Under the terms of this grant all schools designated as disadvantaged plus schools in the rural phase of the Breaking the Cycle scheme will receive an annual grant of £1,000 per school while all other schools will receive £500 per school. Circular 28/00 which issued from my Department to all schools in October 2000 outlines specific materials or activities on which schools may spend this grant. The circular specifically states that &ldquo;schools may also wish to use the grant to alleviate the costs incurred with the provision of swimming classes or other similar activities&rdquo;. My Department will shortly be making arrangements for the issue of this year's grants to schools.</P>

      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act provides for the establishment of a National Educational Welfare Board and a nationwide educational welfare service with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school on a regular basis or otherwise receives an adequate level of education.</P>
      <P>As an initial step in the implementation of the Act, I am establishing a designate board on a non-statutory basis for an interim period, to draw up detailed plans for implementing the various functions to be assigned to the board under the Act.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to conduct a survey of radon levels in schools in 1998. All schools recognised by my Department were invited to participate. The survey is being conducted in three phases. The results of phase I of the survey were released to the participating schools in January 2000. In November last year, the results of phase II of the survey were released to schools in the counties participating in that phase. Phase III of the survey is under way at present and the results are expected late this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May last year the Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order, 2000 (Statutory Instrument 125 of 2000) gave effect to the most recent revision of the EURATOM Basic Safety Standards Directive (Council Directive 96/29/EURATOM). This sets a national reference level for radon in workplaces of 400 bqMf7&gt;3 over any three month period. If radon exceeds <Col N="1149" /> this level an employer must evaluate whether remedial measures should be undertaken and, if so, such measures should be undertaken as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>Mitigation measures are complete in thirteen of the worst affected schools that participated in phase I of the survey and preliminary post mitigation testing indicates that the measures taken have been effective. Contracts have been placed to carry out remedial work in a further 20 schools from phase I. Work is under way in most of these schools and it is expected that all of the systems will be installed by the end of the Easter break.</P>
    <P>The RPII advised that 23 of the worst affected schools that participated in phase II should be given priority when mitigation arrangements were being made. An expert in radon mitigation from Cornwall County Council visited ten of these schools last month and will visit the remaining schools when he returns to Ireland in March and May. He will provide specifications for mitigation for all 23 schools in time to have them installed by the summer of this year at the very latest. Arrangements will also be made to have remedial work carried out in another 51 schools with maximum radon levels in one or more rooms in a range between 404 bqMf7&gt;3 and 656 bqMf7&gt;3. It is hoped that more local expertise can be found to specify the remedial measures necessary in these schools.</P>
    <P>My Department had previously set a reference level of 200 bqMf7&gt;3 above which remedial measures to mitigate radon levels would be undertaken. This reference level is the same as that above which the Government, in 1990, advised that mitigation measures should be considered in domestic dwellings.</P>
    <P>A pilot study of the natural ventilation in ten schools with maximum radon levels of between 200 bqMf7&gt;3 and 400 bqMf7&gt;3 is under way at present. The purpose of the study is to establish whether passive ventilation systems can be used to mitigate radon levels in this range, as opposed to the mechanical systems that have been, or are in the process of being, installed in the schools with higher levels. The results of the study are expected very shortly. These will allow my Department to plan a mitigation programme for the schools with maximum radon levels in excess of 200 bqMf7&gt;3 but not exceeding 400 bqMf7&gt;3. Meanwhile, my Department is advising schools that increasing the natural ventilation in affected rooms, where this can be achieved without discomfort to the users of those rooms, may be effective in reducing the level of radon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Two measures have been in place since 1991 to address child protection and child abuse prevention in schools. From a management perspective, guidelines entitled Procedures for Dealing with Allegations or Suspicions of Child Abuse were circulated to primary and post-primary schools in 1991-92. Between 1991-93, the child abuse prevention programme, Stay Safe, was introduced to primary schools. Stay Safe is a personal safety skills programme designed to help prevent all forms of child victimisation. A one day training course was provided for all primary teachers during that time. A total of 98.5% of schools availed of the training provided and 74% of schools currently implement the Stay Safe programme. My Department continues to support the activities of the child abuse prevention pro<Col N="1151" /> gramme office, which include in-service training for teachers, parent education programmes and the updating of resource materials.</P>
      <P>In the broader context, personal safety and protection has been included in the curriculum area, social, personal and health education, as part of the revised primary school curriculum 1999 and in the junior cycle syllabus, which is being introduced to all post-primary schools on a phased basis since September 2000. The relationships and sexuality education curriculum, which was disseminated to primary and post-primary schools in 1996, also includes issues of personal safety. Through this work, children and young people are made aware of potentially dangerous situations and are given the opportunity to explore strategies and develop skills that can be used to help protect themselves and others.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children published new national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children, Children First, in September 1999. These guidelines are an important step in strengthening arrangements for the protection of children. The Children First guidelines place an onus on statutory and voluntary-community organisations to draw up local guidelines to complement Children First and to make them as effective and meaningful as possible.</P>
      <P>As a follow-up to the Children First guidelines my Department will shortly be issuing new child protection guidelines and procedures to all primary schools. These child protection guidelines and procedures have been developed following an extensive consultation and discussion process with the partners in education and a representative from the health boards. It is intended that these new child protection guidelines and procedures will be issued to primary schools in a set that would also contain a copy of Children First.</P>
      <P>These child protection guidelines and procedures will replace the guidelines entitled Procedures for Dealing with Allegations or Suspicions of Child Abuse which issued to all schools in 1991-92. They are based on the Children First guidelines but have been specifically developed with the primary school setting in mind. The intention of the new guidelines and procedures is to assist, and give direction and guidance to all school management authorities and school personnel in identifying, reporting and dealing with allegations-suspicions of child abuse.</P>
      <P>While these guidelines are aimed at the primary school sector, they will be used as a basis for agreeing similar guidelines in the postprimary sector.</P>

Based on a 66% response rate from primary schools and 46% from post-primary schools, the data indicated that 40% of respondent primary schools were already implementing an RSE programme and 77% indicated an intention to teach RSE in some or all classes during the 2000/01 school year. The data also show that 81% of respondent post-primary schools are already implementing RSE in some or all classes and 84% indicated their intention to teach RSE in some or all classes during the 2000/01 school year.</P>
      <P>Very good progress is being made with regard to the introduction of RSE. The figures quoted above represent a steady increase on the 1999 figures.</P>

      <P>As a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers, my Department requested the colleges of education to provide a postgraduate course to enable degree holders train as primary teachers. The duration of this full-time course is 18 months. Eligible secondary teachers may apply for this course in the normal way. My Department has no plans at present to provide a course designed exclusively for secondary teachers.</P>
      <P>As part of the minimum academic requirements, specified by my Department for entry to primary teacher training, all candidates, including school leavers, mature students and university graduates, must have a minimum of a grade C in higher level in Irish in the leaving certificate or an approved equivalent. This requirement embodies both the written and oral element of a student's proficiency in Irish. My Department considers it to be the minimum standard in Irish necessary for students entering a teacher training course which will equip them to teach Irish to pupils at all levels of the primary school. The Ceard Teastas is not regarded as an approved equivalent to the leaving certificate requirement for entry to primary teacher training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there are no plans at present to amend the entry requirements, requirements in this area are kept under review by my Department, in consultation with the authorities of the colleges of <Col N="1153" /> education, and are also being considered by the working group set up to review the full-time pre-service teacher training courses.</P>

      <P>Excluding senior management posts, there are 70 serving primary school inspectors at this time, 12 of whom were recruited within the past year. As with all other Divisions within my Department, staffing levels are kept under continual review.</P>
      <P>The role of primary inspectors is encompassed in the statement of statutory functions of my Department's inspectorate as set out in section 13(3) of the Education Act, 1998. Those functions include the following: to support and advise recognised schools, teachers and boards of management on matters relating to the provision of education, through evaluation of the organisation and operation of schools and the quality, effectiveness and standards of education provided therein, including the quality and effectiveness of individual teachers; to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the provision of education in the State; to conduct research into education and to support policy formulation; to evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching, development, promotion and use of Irish in schools, and to advise on any matter relating to education policy and provision, including curriculum, assessment and teaching methods.</P>
      <P>Primary schools are inspected on a cyclical basis in line with annual inspection targets. At present, a comprehensive school report &ndash; Tuairisc Scoile &ndash; is furnished on a primary school approximately every six years following a detailed school inspection. The work of individual teachers is inspected in accordance with the rules for national schools and this relates largely to teachers on probation and those experiencing professional difficulties. Inspectors also become familiar with the ongoing work of schools and teachers through frequent incidental inspection visits to schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to formal inspection activity, primary inspectors are also engaged in supporting the implementation of the revised primary curriculum and the associated in-career development programme for teachers, promoting school development planning and school self-evaluation, contributing significantly to the analysis, design and, where appropriate, implementation of special needs provision, through, for example, direct management of visiting teaching services, design of curriculum and teacher guidelines, <Col N="1154" /> assessing and advising on applications for special examination arrangements, involvement in specialist task forces and on admissions committees of special education facilities planning for the education of refugees and asylum-seekers, supporting the implementation of a wide variety of schemes and initiatives targeting pupils in schools serving disadvantaged areas, participating in cyclical national and international surveys of educational attainment, monitoring the quality of pre-service and in-career education of teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>Since September, 1999 the remedial teaching service has been extended to all primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios may also seek remedial support from my Department where the level of their particular need warrants such a service. There are currently 1480 remedial teachers working in primary schools.</P>
      <P>The ex-quota allocations to individual second level schools in respect of remedial education and guidance for a particular school year are determined by the enrolment in the school at the end of the preceding September.</P>
      <P>With regard to remedial education, all schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education since the beginning of the 1999-2000 school year. The general position is that schools with enrolments of 600 or more pupils are allocated a full post; schools with enrolments below 600 pupils are allocated 0.5 of a post. However, schools with enrolments below 600 which were specifically allocated a full post in respect of remedial education by my Department prior to the 1999-2000 school year retain their entitlement to an allocation of a full post.</P>
      <P>In the case of guidance, the allocation varies between two wholetime teacher equivalents &ndash; 44 hours per week &ndash; in the case of schools with enrolments of 1,000 or more pupils, to a minimum allocation of 0.36 wholetime teacher equivalents &ndash; eight hours per week &ndash; in the case of schools with less than 200 pupils.</P>
      <P>In the school year 2000-01 the ex-quota allocations to second level schools in respect of remedial education and guidance are of the order of 560 wholetime teacher equivalents and 580 wholetime teacher equivalents respectively.</P>
      <P>The question of increasing the ex-quota allocations in respect of remedial education and guidance will be considered in the context of available resources and having regard to the report of the expert group on teacher allocations which is expected to be available in the near future.</P>
      <P>There is no provision at present for the allocation of child psychology positions to individual primary or second level schools.</P>

      <P>An estimated 140,500 students participate in part-time adult education in second-level schools each year, largely on a self-funded basis. However, figures are not available on the employment status of this group. The Department contributes some £1.3 million to the organisational start up costs of those programmes through structures for post of responsibility allowances. A further £15.416 million will be provided this year for adult literacy services and basic adult and community education. Nearly 14,600 participants avail of free adult literacy programmes, of whom about 37% are employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with proposals in the White Paper &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo;, a major expansion of part-<Col N="1157" /> time options under Youthreach, VTOS and PLC programmes will be implemented under a back to education initiative in the further education section. Funds for this are being provided under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 in order to increase the flexibility of the system and enable participants to combine education, family and work responsibilities. It is estimated that by the end of the plan, some 20,000 extra people annually will be availing of part-time programmes in further education. Under the new initiative, which will commence shortly, it is envisaged that those in employment will pay fees, unless they are holders of medical cards, family income supplement or means-tested welfare payments, or their dependants.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1996, as amended by the Finance Act, 1997, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time undergraduate courses which are of a minimum duration of two years and are followed in colleges approved for the higher education grants scheme or in colleges which satisfy the prescribed codes of standards.</P>
    <P>In the 1997 Finance Act provision was made to extend tax relief, at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved part-time undergraduate courses operated by colleges in any EU member state providing distance education in the State.</P>
    <P>In relation to the above reliefs, the maximum level of qualifying fees is £2,500.</P>

      <P>I have previously welcomed the report, referred to by the Deputy, which represents a comprehensive analysis of the funding arrangements of post primary schools.</P>
      <P>The recommendations made for the future funding arrangements of second level schools contained in the report, including those relating to the funding of secretarial and caretaking services, are under continuing review. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, my priority to date is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
      <P>I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. The introduction of this support fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils.</P>
      <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to improve funding at second level and it is my intention that this report will inform policy on future school funding.</P>

This programme had been introduced into 2787 or 87% of primary schools by the end of the year 2000. It is expected that 3000 schools will have accessed support by the end of June of this year. This rep<Col N="1159" /> resents 94% of all primary schools. By way of training, a one day seminar for each school staff and an optional three hours per week over nine weeks were offered to all primary schools.</P>
      <P>The programme for post-primary schools, called &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; was introduced in approximately 570 or 75% of post-primary schools and 1700 teachers from post-primary schools had 50 hours training for that programme.

      <P>The great majority of teachers in ordinary schools use standardised norm referenced tests in literacy and mathematics. Very low functioning on these tests is an indication that a child may have special educational needs and is generally used as a basis for referral of the child to the national educational psychological service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national educational psychological service has responsibility for providing an educational psychological service to children and young people attending schools and other educational institutions recognised by my Department, with a particular emphasis on identifying and supporting pupils with special educational needs. By the end of the year 2003, every school in the country should be assigned to a NEPS psychologist and <Col N="1160" /> most schools will have access to the service before that time.</P>
    <P>The nature and level of the support made available to children with special educational needs is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. My Department's inspectorate is available to assist with decisions regarding suitable educational placements for such pupils.</P>
    <P>In many cases, children exhibiting less serious forms of special need, including emotional disturbance, are capable of attending ordinary primary schools on an integrated basis. Such children can be supported by the resource teacher service and-or the special needs assistant service. The number of resource teachers catering for children with special needs in the primary system, including children with emotional disturbance, has increased from 104 in October 1998 to 742 by the end of year 2000. The number of special needs assistants has grown from 299 to 1,629 over the same period. My Department is continuing to allocate additional resource teachers and special needs assistants in response to identified needs.</P>
    <P>Where more pronounced forms of emotional disturbance are involved, the children have access to a range of special schools and special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities operate at reduced pupil-teacher ratios and attract extra funding allocations.</P>
    <P>At present, there are 14 special schools catering for pupils with emotional disturbance and one special school for pupils with severe emotional disturbance. In addition, there are five special classes attached to ordinary primary schools to cater for such children.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor provision for the children in question and any necessary additional provision will be made available in response to identified needs.</P>

      <P>The objectives of substance misuse prevention programmes in primary and post-primary schools address issues which are relevant in the context of the national alcohol policy. I fully support these developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to change in the curriculum, the revised primary school curriculum, launched in September 1999, has, for the first time, included social, personal and health education as a curriculum area with dedicated time on the school timetable. The phased introduction of an SPHE junior cycle syllabus for post-primary schools began in September 2000. SPHE includes topics such as alcohol and its misuse. &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo;, <Col N="1161" /> a post-primary substance abuse prevention programme continues to be available for senior cycle students.</P>
    <P>The development of both the &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo; and the &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; programmes included the production of resource materials and the delivery of in-career development programmes for teachers. My Department has, to date, provided in excess of £0.5 million to support the &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo; programme and this year substantial moneys have been allocated to support the promotion of the SPHE programme at junior cycle level.</P>

      <P>Ireland has to meet a binding international obligation to provide nautical training to new mandatory international standards as set by the International Convention on Standards Of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended in 1995 (STCW'95) which comes into effect in February 2002.</P>
      <P>Following a Government decision in May 2000, approval was given for the establishment of a national maritime college in Ringaskiddy, County Cork, using the public private partnership model. The new college is to be a constituent school of the Cork Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>The national maritime college will accommodate the department of nautical studies of the Cork Institute of Technology and the naval college of the Irish Naval Service, and planning for the provision of the college is well under way in my Department. Following an advertisement in the Official Journal of the European Communities and in the national media, management consultants were appointed last week to support my Department's public private partnership unit with the procurement of the project. In parallel with the process of appointing management consultants, an application for outline planning permission for the new college was submitted to Cork County Council in September last.</P>
      <P>Although, at this stage of the process, it is not possible to give the Deputy a detailed timetable for the project, I assure him that the planning and provision of the new college is being given top priority in my Department.</P>

      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government is committed to evaluating the impact of the section 50 tax incentive scheme introduced in the Finance Act, 1999. As part of this evaluation, a survey is currently being undertaken by my Department in order to establish the existing and future supply of student accommodation.</P>

      <P>The details of the overall number of buses involved in the school transport scheme, their age profile and the number of accidents that occurred in the years 1997 to 2000 are being assembled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Bus Éireann operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. All school transport vehicles are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass that Department's annual roadworthiness test. This test is carried out as directed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, in test centres authorised by that Department. Only buses that have passed this test are used in school transport operations.</P>
      <P>Contractors employed by Bus Éireann to provide services under the school transport scheme must satisfy strict criteria and must hold a road passenger operator's licence. Vehicles nominated for use under the scheme must be suitable for the conveyance of school children and must have complete and current documentation in respect of both buses and drivers as required by law. The vehicles have to be kept and maintained in a safe and roadworthy condition and to comply in all respects with the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
      <P>Personnel from my Department do not inspect school buses. I understand that inspectors from the Department of the Environment and Local Government carry out spot checks. Contractor's vehicles are also subject to inspection-testing by Bus Éireann inspectors from time to time to ensure the safety of pupils travelling on buses.</P>
      <P>My Department and Bus Éireann, who operate the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, consider safety on school buses to be of paramount importance. However, with such a large operation as the school transport scheme, there is a need to be ever vigilant with regard to safety. As I announced recently, I have asked my Department in co-operation with Bus Éireann to review safety procedures on school buses. This review will examine in detail current safety procedures and all areas where improvements can be put in place to ensure a safer service for our children. I have requested that the examination be given priority status and completed within three months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> The difficulties in question are partly reflective of the general problem of securing suitable staff which is a feature of many sectors of the economy at present. However, I am also aware that particular difficulties have arisen in the case of some individual services due to the dispersed locations of the starting and finishing points of individual routes and the need for escorts to be available to travel to and from these points. I can assure the Deputy that my Department makes every effort to accommodate schools encountering such difficulties and will continue to work with schools to ensure that this valuable support service is put in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme is operated through the 33 vocational education committees. The latest figures show that there are 99 VTOS centres in operation with a total of 5,174 students in attendance.</P>
      <P>The latest complete figures available regarding educational standards of VTOS students on admission to VTOS are those taken on 1 January 2000. Data are currently being complied for 1 January 2001. Returns show that 20.62% had less than junior certificate standard and a further 28.99% had less than leaving certificate standard on entry to the course, that is, 49.61% had less than upper second level education.</P>
      <P>There has been an increase in demand for VTOS places in the current academic year. Up to this, the number of places available were considered to be adequate to meet demand on a national level. Unfilled places in some centres have been redeployed to meet emerging needs.</P>
      <P>Where demand exceeds supply in certain areas there is the option for applicants on dispersed VTOS programmes to undertake their course of study via the back to education allowance scheme, which is administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to VTOS, 34% of participants on PLC courses are adults over 21 re-entering education. A further 14,591 are participants on free adult literacy programmes, and of the order of 140,600 participants take part in self-funded adult education programmes provided by vocational <Col N="1165" /> education committees and community and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>The National Development Plan 2000-06 identifies the need to expand adult and second chance education and training opportunities. The back to education initiative, as set out in the recent White Paper on adult education, Learning for Life, proposes to expand VTOS, Youthreach, PLC and senior Traveller training programmes on a part-time basis. The intention is that this new initiative will address the increase in demand for places and provide flexibility in provision of programmes to meet the demands of adults wishing to return to education and training. An adult ICT skills programme will form part of the measure, and community education opportunities will also be expanded. A particular priority will be to increase provision at foundation and level 1 or equivalent for those with low skills. This initiative corresponds with an objective of the national development plan to facilitate the development of a system of lifelong learning which includes the provision of accessible and flexible routes of progression in respect of education and training.</P>

      <P>The Schools IT 2000 project was launched in November 1997 and, to the end of the year 2000, more than £40 million had been invested by the State in implementing the project. Some £20 million in additional funding was provided by the private sector.</P>
      <P>The overall aim of Schools IT 2000 is to ensure that pupils in every school have the opportunity to achieve computer and Internet literacy and to equip themselves for participation in the information society. To this end, grants issued to all schools &ndash; excluding further education colleges and schools not recognised for grant purposes under the free education scheme &ndash; to build up their technology infrastructure, a comprehensive teacher training programme in ICTs was provided and support services were established.</P>
      <P>A survey carried out for my Department indicates that, to date, there are approximately 56,000 multimedia computers in Irish first and second level schools &ndash; an increase of 65% since 1998; 75% of teachers have taken ICT skills training courses; the ratio of pupils to computers has fallen to 17.7:1 at first level and 13:1 at second level; all schools have been provided with an Internet connection and over 90% of schools have used e-mail; 78% of second level schools and 18% of first level schools have local area networks; 69% of second level schools have an ISDN connection and 62% have multi-user Internet access; 46% of second level schools and 15% of first level schools have websites.</P>
      <P>In addition, in first level schools there has been a significant increase in the use of ICT in the curriculum. This is especially so in English, other modern languages, learning support and mathematics. Approximately 400 schools are participating in 70 innovative ICT projects under the schools integration project. The outcome of these projects is being evaluated and will be disseminated to assist in development of best practice not only in Ireland but further afield. Special funding was made available for pupils with special needs in recognition of the special benefits they have been shown to derive from use of ICT in their education and further dedicated funding of £1.75 million is being made available for this area in 2001.</P>

    <P>In relation to engineering, I have held discussions with the Institution of Engineers in Ireland on their &ldquo;STEPS&rdquo; promoting engineering as a career project. Arising out of these discussions I agreed to provide the IEI with an initial lump sum grant of £50,000, and also to provide additional funding for up to a further three years to fund, in the main, the costs of a project manager.</P>

      <P>Arising from a Government decision of October 1998 all children with special needs at primary level now have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs.</P>
      <P>Children with special needs who attend ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis are supported by the resource teacher service and the special needs assistant service. Since October 1998 the number of full-time equivalent resource teachers supporting children with special needs in integrated settings in primary schools has increased from 104 to more than 750. The number of special needs assistants allocated over the same period has risen from 299 to more than 1,600. My Department is continuing to allocate additional resource teachers and special needs assistants in response to identified needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> My Department also provides funding to meet the special equipment needs of children with disabilities, including children attending school on a fully integrated basis. I have secured an additional £1.75 million in the current year to address the special equipment needs of such children. This allocation is in addition to the £987,000 already available to fund the purchase of computers and other equipment for the children in question.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there have been ongoing difficulties in relation to the delivery of adequate speech therapy services to children within the school system. I have brought my concerns in this regard to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children has commissioned Dr. Peter Bacon to undertake a workforce planning study on therapists, including speech therapists. The Higher Education Authority is represented on the steering group for the study and I understand that a report is expected in the near future.</P>
    <P>As an interim measure, in response to the current shortage of speech and language therapists, arrangements have been made to increase the intake into the programme at Trinity College, Dublin, to 29 for the current academic year.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to liaise with the Department of Health and Children on this matter and will give positive consideration to any recommendations in relation to the training of additional speech therapists which may arise from the review so as to ensure that adequate services are available to all children in schools who require them.</P>

      <P>A national assessment of English reading &ndash; NAER &ndash; with fifth class pupils was carried out in 1998. The findings of the study are that standards of English reading in 1998 were the same as in 1993 and that standards have not changed since 1980. There has been no change in the performance of low achieving pupils. Teachers rated the reading proficiency of about one in ten pupils as &ldquo;weak-inadequate&rdquo; and an equal number as reading at third class level or lower. More than one in five pupils was regarded as being &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; in reading, while a third was judged to be reading at a class level higher than fifth class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1999, a survey of the mathematics attainments of pupils in fourth class was conducted by the Educational Research Centre, Drum<Col N="1170" /> condra, and the inspectorate of my Department. Results of the survey are not yet available. Ireland is also a participant in the programme for international student assessment of the OECD &ndash; the PISA project. This project examined the attainment of 15 year olds, principally in reading, in 2000. The results of this survey are not yet available. Mathematics attainments will be the main focus in 2003 and science in 2006.</P>
    <P>Evidence from earlier international studies, conducted during the last decade, in which Irish students participated, namely, the IEA 1990/1991 literacy studies, the IAEP 1991 mathematics studies, and the 1995 third international mathematics and science study, shows that Irish students performed above international averages generally.</P>
    <P>While it is gratifying to see that Irish pupils generally perform at a level above the international average in both literacy and mathematics, it still does not allow us to be complacent about standards. Special attention must be given to the significant number of pupils, estimated at 10%, who perform at a low level in both areas. In addition, in a competitive international environment, overall standards need to improve. The failure to register an increase in mean level of reading achievement in recent years among fifth class pupils is a cause for concern. It points to problems that need to be addressed in policy and in the condition of learning in schools and homes.</P>
    <P>It is felt that the existing practice, where schools annually test their pupils using standardised tests, best meets the needs of pupils and their parents. It is my intention to continue and extend the programme of literacy and mathematics surveys at various levels in the primary school.</P>

      <P>The development of initiatives in my Department that support schools serving areas of socio-economic disadvantage began in the early 1980s. The projects, schemes and initiatives since then have developed in their focus and in their objectives. There has been a change of emphasis in the programmes from equalising opportunity in the schools for children who were at risk of not achieving their potential in school to targeted programmes that discriminate positively in favour of those children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials in my Department have been careful not to use the term &ldquo;disadvantaged school&rdquo; in relation to designated schools since the same quality of provision, school building, <i>per capit</i>a funding, teacher qualifications, etc., applies to all schools. Schools have been designated by my Department in the past as serving areas of disadvantage and have been allocated additional <Col N="1171" /> resources on a whole-school basis as a consequence of that designation. The resources, however, had to be targeted at the specific pupils who were most at risk.</P>
    <P>Currently, the allocation of resources to schools under the recent new programme of supports for pupils in primary school from disadvantaged backgrounds that I launched on 4 January 2001, reflects the level of concentration in those schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Those resources must be targeted at specific &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils. The &ldquo;stay in school&rdquo; retention initiative &ndash; SSRI &ndash; at second level includes the schools that serve disadvantaged areas in which there is a higher incidence of early school leaving than other areas. Resources allocated to those schools must also be targeted at young people who, on the basis of clear criteria, are deemed to be most at risk of early school leaving.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Disadvantaged&rdquo;, therefore, does not refer to the schools but rather to the communities they serve and to backgrounds of the pupils who attend the schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. I will consider the appropriate response when I receive the team's report.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on student support, including the cost of the free fees initiative, amounted to approximately £250 million in 2000. There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with disabilities. I established an action group on access to third level education, in September 2000, to advise on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote participation at third level by such students. I expect to receive the group's report in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an indication of the Government's support in promoting equity in access and, as an initial step pending the findings of the action group, I have announced the introduction of a special <Col N="1172" /> maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over the standard rates as follows: from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college; and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles of college.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy refers to my launch on 4 January of the new programme of supports for pupils in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
      <P>The role of parents in their children's education is clearly defined in the Education Act, 1998. The promotion of the role of parents in their children's education in areas of disadvantage has been a core element of the Department of Education and Science policy and practice since 1990. The development of the home-school-community liaison scheme that began in that year in designated schools serving areas of disadvantage has the specific aim of promoting collaboration between parents and teachers in the interests of children's education. The principle of parental involvement and development remains high on the Department's agenda and continues to be a core element of its strategies in addressing educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Under the new programme, resources will have to be deployed on promoting the involvement of the parents of targeted children in their children's education and development. Specific provision from the new resources will have to be made to meet parents' developmental needs, to enhance their recognition of the role they play in their children's education, and to promote their capacity to carry out that role. These requirements are clearly indicated in the conditions of acceptance of the additional resources in the new programme brochure &ldquo;Giving Children an Even Break by Tackling Disadvantage&rdquo;. The relevant conditions state that schools must &ldquo;involve parents in their children's education and develop specific strategies that will support parents so that they can engage in that role&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>All participants on the job initiative programme are not automatically entitled to secondary benefits, which include the Christmas bonus payment. In general, participants on JI may retain any secondary benefits they had prior to participating on the programme subject to the usual retention arrangements for secondary benefits.</P>
      <P>The eligible categories for Christmas bonus payments under the JI are former recipients of long-term unemployment assistance, former recipients of unemployment benefit, and former recipients of one parent family payment whose entitlement to this payment ceased by virtue of their qualifying child or children reaching 18 years of age in the course of participation on JI.</P>
      <P>Payment of the Christmas 2000 bonus payment, which was administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, was calculated by reference to the JI participants' previous social welfare entitlement, based on 100% of that entitlement paid at the current rate. Lone parents on JI who are in receipt of the one parent family payment received their Christmas bonus payment under this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has confirmed that arrangements are being made to have any outstanding payments made to remaining eligible participants.</P>
      <P>The terms of employment on community employment including the number of hours worked per week, allowances, and eligibility criteria are different to those obtaining on JI. It is not appropriate, therefore, to compare the two programmes in regard to eligibility for Christmas bonus payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the major increases in the Irish Government's programme of development co-operation, as committed by the Taoiseach at the millennium summit, the role of NGOs is being strengthened. This is manifested by increased levels of funding. The provisional outturn for the aid programme in 2000 is approximately £210 million, of which £138 million is under the direct control of Ireland Aid through the Department of Foreign Affairs. NGOs received approximately £19 million directly from the Department. In addition, we estimate that approximately £8.35 million was dispersed to NGOs via APSO and NCDE &ndash; both organisations are directly funded by Ireland Aid. Therefore, a total of £27.35 million was allocated to NGOs which represents almost 20% of the funds under direct Ireland Aid control for expenditure purposes. A number of Irish NGOs also receive funds from multilateral agencies such as the UN and the EU to which the <Col N="1177" /> Irish Government contributes from its development co-operation budget.</P>
      <P>I fully agree that the provision for NGOs in Vote 39 should be explicitly published as part of the Book of Estimates. Accordingly, in the Revised Estimates Volume for 2001 to be published next month, a breakdown of subhead A, which covers the bilateral aid programme, should show how much has been provided in block grant assistance, in the main co-financing scheme and in the local co-financing scheme. I am confident that the publication of this information will contribute to the growing openness in the management of the aid programme and highlight the developing partnership between the programme and NGOs.</P>
      <P>The partnership between our aid programme and NGOs is set to continue and indeed flourish. My Department is in discussion with a number of the larger NGOs, currently in receipt of block grant funding for development projects and programmes in the Third World, with a view to introducing a system of multi-annual programme budgeting. Adopting a multi-annual programme budgeting system will facilitate better planning of NGO activities and an increased focus on outcomes, rigorous evaluation and long-term impact. The assurance regarding funding levels will allow NGOs to strengthen their own relationships with their partners in developing countries. My Department's discussions with NGOs are progressing well and it is hoped that this new system of budgeting will be in place early in 2002.</P>

      <P>The provision of telecommunications infrastructure and services is a matter in the first instance for the companies which now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy. I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly those in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999, IR£21 million was made available to support the roll-out of telecommunications infrastructure to the regions. This figure has been significantly increased under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, to IR£147 million. This funding will be utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced telecommunications infrastructure and services in the regions.</P>
      <P>The first call for proposals under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 closed on 22 September 2000. The Department received 28 applications for funding under this call. These were assessed and evaluated at arms length by independent consultants. I recently announced the successful 13 projects that will receive a total of IR£59 million in national development plan aid.</P>
      <P>Eight of the successful projects involve the development of infrastructure in County Cork (project reference numbers DPE2000-03, DPE2000-04, DPE2000-07, DPE2000-08, DPE2000-15, DPE2000-16, DPE2000-22 and DPE2000-26). Details of all these successful projects are attached.</P>
      <P>My Department is now reviewing future infrastructure investment needs in the light of the results of this first call for proposals.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>the reason a licence has not been granted to a company (details supplied) on the Tuam-Dublin route; if her attention has been drawn to the impending withdrawal of this service; and her views on whether Bus Éireann has a monopoly on many routes.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2826/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The operator in question already holds a licence to operate return services between Tuam and Dublin on Fridays, Sundays and bank holiday Mondays. He has made an application for a licence to operate bus services on a daily basis between Tuam and Dublin and Dublin Airport. The application was received on 8 September 2000 and in keeping with the Department's policy of dealing with applications on a first-come, first-served basis, the application was placed in a queue to be dealt with in turn. However, due to the volume of applications received by the bus route licensing section of my Department, this application has not yet been reached in the queue.</P>
      <P>I expect my Department to be in a position to make a decision on this application by mid-February. This decision will be made in strict accordance with the provisions of the Road Transport Act, 1932, and will have regard to my Department's current licensing guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> I understand that the operator recently announced that he intends to withdraw his existing service on the Tuam-Dublin route with effect from 5 March next, citing cost reasons. This is a matter for the commercial judgment of the operator. My Department has not been officially notified of the proposed withdrawal of service. However, where a licensed service is withdrawn, the licensee is obliged to return the licence and it would be then open to another operator to apply for a licence to operate this route.</P>
    <P>Bus Éireann is subject to competition from private operators on a number of the routes that it operates. Under the Road Transport Act, 1932, my Department is obliged to have regard to existing passenger transport services when an application for a route licence is received. Each application is considered on a case by case basis and as a general rule, the Department's policy is to grant one licence per route or service. However more than one licence may be granted on the same route where the market demand justifies it.</P>

      <P>My Department's proposals for the new early retirement scheme that commenced on 27 November 2000 and which forms part of the CAP rural development plan for the period 2000-2006, included provision for annual increases in pension over the period of the plan. The European Commission indicated that this proposal was unacceptable and that a fixed rate of pension had to be set. My Department then proposed a rate which was the average of the scale initially put forward. This was acceptable to the Commission and is the rate provided for in the new scheme.</P>

The Commission responded on 6 September 2000 with a request for additional information. The matter was then discussed in detail at meetings with the Commission and discussions in relation to the detailed content of the final reply are concluding with Commission officials at present. As things stand, it appears that it will take some more months before the business tax incentives elements of the scheme will be approved by the Commission.

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of major road project planning, local authorities initiate, at an early stage, a process of public consultation in connection with route selection. Typically the initial public consultation takes the form of an information brochure or similar material addressed to local communities and business interests outlining the need for the project, a general description of broadband corridor route options and a questionnaire seeking the views and concerns of the public. In addition, public presentations are arranged by the local authority at a number of venues in the area concerned to outline the proposal and address requests for information or clarification.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the public response, together with the findings of studies conducted to identify route constraints, the local authority identifies a preferred route, which is also the subject of public consultation. The primary purpose of the consultation exercise is to bring the public up to date on developments in the planning of the project taking account of public feedback and the findings of constraint studies and, in particular, to outline information on the preferred route option.</P>
      <P>The above consultations are pre-statutory and it is not considered appropriate for them to be subjected to detailed regulation. The statutory procedures for taking forward major road projects which involve environmental impact assessment and motorway scheme or CPO, are set out in Part IV of the Roads Act, 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that it is standard practice for the NRA and local authorities concerned to periodically update elected members on developments in relation to major national road projects as part of the overall public consultation process. It is a matter for the NRA or local authorities to comply with statutory procedures in relation to public notice and the provision of access to environmen<Col N="1195" /> tal impact statements, motorway schemes and compulsory purchase orders.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations, 2000, establish a revised regime for taxi licensing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new regime includes measures directed at an improved quality of service, such as yearly testing of all taxi vehicles, instead of two-yearly as previously. Testing is being carried out by the National Car Testing Service and, for an initial period until 30 June 2001, by the Garda. In addition, all taxi vehicles will from 2002 have to <Col N="1196" /> be fitted with taximeters capable of issuing automatic receipts.</P>
    <P>Existing requirements in the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 2000 in relation to public service vehicle driver licensing, insurance and the formal specification for a wheelchair accessible taxi continue to apply. In addition, there are existing regulatory requirements in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 2000 in relation to vehicles to be licensed as taxis, for example, number of doors, seats, passenger accommodation, etc. The same vehicle standards continue to apply to new licence applicants as have applied to applicants prior to the liberalisation of taxi licensing. These do not include requirements as to hours of operation. I have also indicated my intention that, by end 2003, the process will commence of making all taxi vehicles wheelchair accessible.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a rapid improvement of taxi services under the new arrangements. In addition, it is intended to consult extensively with representatives of consumer groups, of disabled persons and of taxi service providers to develop further quality improvements for taxi services in the medium term.</P>

      <P>Last year was the first year in which the Christmas bonus was paid to participants in the job initiative programme. In the ordinary course of events the bonus payment would be made by FÁS but my Department agreed to effect the payment in this instance as it was not possible owing to the shortness of time to make other arrangements. The initial coverage of programme participants &ndash; those who were formerly in receipt of unemployment assistance &ndash; was extended to other categories &ndash; those formerly in receipt of unemployment benefit and <Col N="1198" /> those on one parent family payments &ndash; during the course of the implementation, but, unfortunately, not in time to allow for payment to them before Christmas.

      <P>The job initiative programme is a pilot initiative which is administered by FÁS, under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The question raised by the Deputy in regard to the entitlements of workers on the programme to secondary benefits is therefore more appropriate to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who has overall policy responsibility for the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, the position is that participants on the job initiative programme may retain their secondary benefits at the level which obtained prior to participation on the programme, subject to a weekly gross household income limit of £250 per week. It should be noted that the rent supplement is phased out over a four-year period, with 75% <Col N="1199" /> of the claimant's previous entitlement being paid in the first year on the programme and 50%, 25% and 25% being paid in the subsequent three years.</P>
    <P>My Department administered the Christmas bonus payments to job initiative participants on an agency basis on behalf of FÁS in 2000. In this context, the arrangements for the payment of the bonus to job initiative workers were cleared with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which is responsible for the programme. Under these arrangements, the bonus was paid to former recipients of long-term unemployment assistance &ndash; LTUA &ndash; at 100% of the current equivalent of the former LTUA entitlement. Subsequently, these arrangements were extended to include former recipients of unemployment benefit and former one parent family payment recipients whose entitlement had ceased in the course of the programme by virtue of the qualified child or children reaching 18 years.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of one parent family payment is that the lone parent is not cohabiting, that is, not living with someone as husband and wife.</P>
      <P>During a review of the entitlement to lone parent's allowance of the person concerned in 1996, it emerged that she had been cohabiting since 1994. Consequently, payment of one parent family payment was discontinued. The fact that the person with whom she is cohabiting is not the father of her child does not affect the application of the legislation in such cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 130 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>The consultants were asked to examine and report on the application for a licence fee increase submitted by RTE with particular reference to the financial and market assumptions on which the application is based, and RTE's current overall financial position, having regard to the following: the functions and general duties of the authority as laid down in the broadcasting legislation since 1960, as proposed to be further defined in the Broadcasting Bill, 1999; the impact of the transformation process being implemented in RTE and the introduction of new broadcasting technologies and delivery platforms, particularly digital terrestrial television, on the finances of the organisation and the proceeds from the sale of RTE's shareholding in Cablelink and from the proposed sale of the transmission network.</P>
      <P>In particular, the consultants were asked to: comprehensively analyse and offer an opinion on the key arguments and assumptions in RTE's submission supporting its case for a IR£50 increase in the television licence; comment on the progress being made by RTE on the implementation of the transformation process and identify where cost savings arising have been taken into account in RTE's application; offer opinions as to the range of fee increase that could be objectively justified on the basis of their examination to maintain present quality output in radio and television in accordance with RTE's statutory remit and fund the establishment of new services in the digital era.</P>
      <P>I have received the report of the consultants which is receiving careful examination in my Department. My proposals will be brought to Government at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <P>I received sanction in November 2000 from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, for additional solicitor and administrative support posts, both permanent and temporary, to facilitate the expansion of the refugee legal service. I understand that the board will proceed with the filling of these posts when their office accommodation has been fitted out.</P>
    <P>I can further inform the Deputy that negotiations are ongoing with the Law Society to agree a more attractive package for the use of private practitioners by the board. I expect to be in a position to make a statement on this matter shortly.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Legal Aid Board, that the results of a recent open competition for the recruitment of solicitors has been finalised and a number of appointments are pending. I have been further informed by the board that they expect to re-advertise for solicitors, as the recent competition did not result in sufficient qualified applicants being available to meet the board's needs. A long standing pay claim on behalf of solicitor grades was agreed towards the end of last year and the board is hopeful that this will have a positive impact on the forthcoming recruitment competition.</P>

      <P>Arrangements have been in place since 1994 whereby the Garda Síochána carries out clearance checks in respect of full-time prospective employees in the health care area who would have substantial access to children or vulnerable individuals.

      <Col N="1207" /> As I have stated previously, the Garda Commissioner, following a review of &ldquo;clearance&rdquo; arrangements, approved the establishment of a centralised unit to enable the Garda authorities to respond more effectively to requests for clearances.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will provide me with details of the particular school in question, I will arrange to provide him with the information requested.</P>
      <P>The nature and level of support made available to children with special educational needs is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. My Department's inspectorate is available to assist with decisions regarding suitable educational placements for such pupils.</P>
      <P>In many cases, children exhibiting less serious forms of special need are capable of attending ordinary schools on a fully integrated basis. Such children can be supported by the resource teacher service and/or the special needs assistant service. The number of resource teachers catering for children with special needs in primary schools has increased from 104 in October 1998 to 742 by the end of year 2000. The number of special needs assistants has grown from 299 to 1,629 over the same period. My Department is continuing to allocate additional resource teachers and special needs assistants in response to identified needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where more serious disabilities are involved, children can be accommodated in a range of special schools or in special classes attached to ordinary schools. All such facilities are dedicated to particular disability groups and operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. My Department will consider the establishment of additional special schools or special classes in any <Col N="1209" /> situation where the assessed needs of a particular area require such a response.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the development of an efficient and responsive special education system which ensures that all children with special needs, including the children to whom the Deputy refers, receive the support they require where and when they require it. A special planning group was established in my Department to make recommendations on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all stages of the education system for students with disabilities.</P>
    <P> The planning group presented its report in December, 2000 and its recommendations are currently being considered in my Department.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a number of schemes under which financial assistance is available to primary and second level schools generally to improve and enhance their computer and information technology.</P>
      <P>Under the Schools IT 2000 project, initiated in November 1997, £40 million has been provided with the objective of ensuring that pupils in every school have the opportunity of achieving computer and internet literacy and of preparing themselves for participation in the information society. Under this initiative all schools within the free education scheme have received, in two phases, block grants for educational equipment and software, and supplementary grants for a range of special provisions. Planning for the next phase of Schools IT 2000 is currently under way in my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides £3,000 per annum plus £10 per pupil to all primary schools under the minor works scheme. Schools may use this funding to purchase computers, or other equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where my Department approves the building of a new second level school, an extension to an existing school or a major refurbishment of an existing school building, funding is available for the provision of computer hardware and software. As part of the mechanical and electrical design of a second level school building project, ducting for IT equipment is also provided. Funding may, in addition, be made available for replacement computer equipment. Schools providing the restructured leaving certificate vocational &ndash; LCVP &ndash; and-or leaving certificate <Col N="1210" /> applied &ndash; LCA &ndash; programmes receive a once-off grant for equipment, mainly computer equipment.</P>
    <P>Finally, under the school administration project, my Department provides funding to assist schools in acquiring ICT equipment and software for administration purposes.</P>

      <P>With effect from 1996, the student support schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to undergraduate students pursuing approved third level courses in other EU member states. Prior to this, grants were only payable to students who were pursuing approved courses in the Republic and Northern Ireland. In this context it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including in Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying and that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the country in which the student is pursuing his or her course.</P>
      <P>In December 1999, in response to a number of representations, local authorities and vocational education committees were advised that grant holders should be given the option of having their grant paid either in Irish punts or in the currency of the country in which they are studying. This concession allows students studying in Northern Ireland or the UK to receive their grants in Irish punts rather than sterling, if they so wish.</P>
      <P>My Department is satisfied that the current arrangements are equitable and efficient. While the exchange rate difficulties with sterling are appreciated, my Department is not in a position to supplement grant aid for students pursuing courses in the United Kingdom. Moreover, such an approach could well give rise to anomalies and to claims of inequitable treatment between students studying in different countries.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate (PLC) courses 2000, grants are available to eligible candidates who are entering approved PLC courses for the first time in the 2000-2001 school year. Candidates are ineligible if they already hold a National Council For Vocational Awards (NCVA) level 2 or level 3 qualification or a third level qualification at national certificate, national diploma, degree, postgraduate or equivalent level. However, notwithstanding this condition, candidates who already hold an NCVA level 2 qualification and are now pursuing a course that offers progression may be deemed eligible for grant aid.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, grants are not payable in respect of a second period of attendance at the same level for a course approved for the purposes of this scheme, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to change the provisions of the scheme in this regard.</P>

      <P>The ex-quota allocation to individual second level schools in respect of remedial education for a particular school year is determined by the enrolment in the school at the end of the preceding September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education since the beginning <Col N="1212" /> of the 1999-2000 school year. Schools with enrolments of 600 or more pupils are allocated a full post; schools with enrolments below 600 pupils are allocated 0.5 of a post.</P>
    <P>The enrolment in the school to which the Deputy refers warrants an ex-quota allocation of 0.5 of a post in respect of remedial education in the current school year and this allocation has been included in the overall teacher allocation which has been notified to the school authorities.</P>

      <P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education.</P>
      <P>The practice in recent years has been to increase, annually, third level maintenance grants in line with inflation and to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage.</P>
      <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. I will consider the appropriate response when I receive the team's report.</P>
      <P>Students studying at postgraduate level may apply for financial assistance under the terms of the higher education grants scheme or, if appropriate, the Vocational Education Committees' scholarship scheme. For 2000-01 the non-adjacent and adjacent rates of maintenance grant are £1,775 and £887 respectively. A postgraduate grantholder is also eligible to have his or her fees paid up to a maximum amount of £3,064.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> Last October, the student support schemes were amended to provide financial assistance to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained. This amendment is operative from the current academic year, 2000-01.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Finance Act 2000 provided for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This new relief, which is available for the tax year 2000-01 onwards, will apply at the standard rate of tax and will be available to full time and part time postgraduate students.</P>

In general this is a preferable approach to putting in place grants for materials in specific subjects.</P>

      <P>To be fully recognised to teach at primary level, teachers must have undertaken a recognised primary teaching training course and possess a recognised primary teaching qualification. Such a qualification can usually be achieved by a person graduating from one of the recognised teacher training courses in the colleges of education, including the postgraduate conversion courses, or by a primary teacher trained abroad achieving the necessary level of competence in the Irish language.</P>
      <P>While the person referred to by the Deputy is a qualified second level teacher, her qualifications, as is the case with all persons similarly qualified, are not accepted for the purpose of recognition to teach in a permanent capacity in primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as part of a range of measures taken by my Department to address the shortage of qualified teachers at primary level, qualified second level teachers are remunerated at the trained rate of pay when they take up substitute or temporary positions in primary schools. Previous service given by such teachers in second level schools will be reckoned for incremental purposes. In making that change it was never the intention that qualified second level teachers would be afforded full recognition as primary school teachers and allowed to <Col N="1216" /> take up primary teaching posts on a permanent basis. To become so qualified, such teachers would have to undertake a postgraduate conversion course in one of the colleges of education.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, the letter referred to by the Deputy, issued in 1999, incorrectly stated that the person in question had been given full recognition as a primary teacher. The intention was to convey to her that if she served in a substitute or temporary capacity in primary schools her post-primary teacher qualifications would be reckoned for remuneration purposes and that consequently for such service she would be remunerated at the same rate of pay as a fully trained primary teacher </P>

      <P>The Government, since taking up office, has introduced a range of initiatives to help reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools. The pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced from 22.2 to 1 in the 1996-97 school year to 20.4 to 1 in the 1999-2000 school year.</P>
      <P>The retention of posts arising from the demographic dividend in the current year together with the creation of an additional 204 posts to tackle educational disadvantage and the allocation of additional resource posts has helped to reduce the overall pupil teacher ratio in the 2000-2001 school year to 19.6:1.</P>
      <P>An additional 1,000 teaching posts were created at second level in the 2000-01 school year. A proportion of these posts were provided to facilitate the reduction from 19:1 to 18:1 in the pupil teacher ratio for appointment purposes.</P>
      <P>The actual pupil-teacher ratio at second level has been reduced significantly in recent years. The creation of the additional posts, combined with an anticipated fall in enrolments, will result in a further reduction in the actual pupil-teacher ratio in the sector.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness an additional 900 teaching posts will be created at primary level and 400 at second level.

      <P>Following a Government decision of February 1999, the National Educational Psychological Service Agency formally came into being in September of that year. NEPS has been established initially on an administrative basis as a dedicated executive Agency of my Department. It has devolved responsibility for the delivery of an educational psychological service to all schools and other educational centres recognised by my Department.</P>
      <P>The terms of the Government decision allow for the recruitment of approximately 25 psychologists per annum until the target figure of 200 psychologists is reached.</P>
      <P>The current situation is that there are now 78 psychologists serving with NEPS. Until the beginning of this term, they provided an educational psychological service to all second-level schools and to approximately 725 primary schools, but a substantial expansion is now taking place. Of the 78 psychologists mentioned, 28 have been appointed since the beginning of September 2000, and it is hoped that up to 22 more psychologists will be appointed before the end of the current school year. Schools are now being assigned to the newly appointed psychologists.</P>
      <P>In the interests of equity, it is proposed that each cohort of newly appointed psychologists will be shared among the regions on a pro rata basis until each region has reached its target staffing-quota. It is intended that the overall target of 200 psychologists providing a service to all schools will be reached by the end of the year 2003, at the latest.</P>
      <P>Psychological services for children are also provided by the health boards and by voluntary bodies funded by them. It is part of the remit of NEPS to liaise closely with these bodies at both national and local level in order to ensure a coherent delivery of psychological services to all children.</P>

      <P>Significant progress has been made by this Government over the past three years in improving school accommodation.</P>
      <P>Since 1999 this Government has invested massively in capital projects in both the primary and post-primary sectors. For the year 1999, £153 million was allocated to both sectors for capital projects. In 2000, this was increased to £201 million. In the current year the allocation has been further increased to £218 million for both sectors. This compares with only £46.4 million in 1993 and £72.3 million in 1997. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 an unprecedented £824 million has been set-aside for school infrastructure in the primary and post-primary sectors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the review committee on post-secondary education and training of March 1999 concluded that the existing and planned investment in third level places would allow Ireland to meet the strategic objective of being well within the top quarter of OECD countries in relation to undergraduate provision for traditional school leavers. My Department has requested the Higher Education Authority, which has a statutory responsibility to monitor the demand for higher education, to keep this provision under review in the light of unanticipated skills demand, postgraduate needs and developments in competitor countries.</P>
      <P>In response to the needs identified in the First Report of the expert group on future skills, measures have been put in place to address emerging skills needs in IT related areas. These include the allocation of £75 million for the provision of 5,400 IT related third level places, the provision of £6 million to facilitate the continuation of 1,500 places on postgraduate conversion courses in IT related areas and expansion of the accelerated technician programmes to include IT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures have also been put in place to facilitate implementation of the main recommend<Col N="1220" /> ations of the second skills report, completed in March 2000, including the provision on a phased basis of an extra 1,150 degree-level places in the sciences. Significant growth has also been achieved in apprenticeship provision in the education sector, with total numbers increasing from 4,000 in the 1997-98 academic year to over 9,500 in the current academic year.</P>
    <P>A key aim of the £550 million funding available to support and enhance third level research under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 is to provide additional places for postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers. This will contribute to the development of a world class research environment in higher education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy can see from the range of measures and initiatives I have outlined, the needs of the third level sector are constantly kept under review.</P>

      <P>The areas of County Kildare referred to <Col N="1221" /> by the Deputy have been the subject of regular review by my Department in recent years, in view of the general growth in population in the north of the county. At primary level, the position is that, in Naas, a new 16-teacher school is currently in architectural planning. In Kill, while a need for a 16-classroom school has been identified, the current school site does not have the capacity to cater for 16 classrooms and appropriate ancillary accommodation. Accordingly, the Office of Public Works has been asked to locate a suitable site in Kill for a new school. Pending the delivery of permanent accommodation, temporary accommodation will be provided as necessary to cope with immediate accommodation needs. In Sallins, a seven-classroom extension to St. Laurence's National School, which will bring the capacity of the school to 16 classrooms, is in architectural planning.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level, the position is that Kill and Sallins form part of the Naas post-primary catchment area. Following an evaluation of post-primary school requirements in the area, building projects were approved for all three schools in the centre.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that, when these projects are completed, there will be sufficient accommodation to meet future needs at both primary and post-primary level in Naas, Kill and Sallins.</P>
