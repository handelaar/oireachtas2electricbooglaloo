      <P>The House has been repeatedly assured by the Government and by the Taoiseach that action will be taken to deal with the issue of limiting donations to political parties and other amendments in respect of the financing of elections. Yesterday, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government published 71 amendments to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, not one of which met any of the promises repeatedly given here by the Taoiseach. In view of that duplicitous activity by this Government, we are opposed to this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESRI report on the further development of the greater Dublin area predicts that 100,000 new houses will be required in the next five years. The effect of Government policy has been to reduce the number of houses rather than to increase them. For example in the first four months of this year there have been almost 1,000 fewer starts in Dublin than there were last year which is a reduction of 30%. The construction of houses in Galway is down by 30%, in Limerick it is down by 25%, in Cork it is down by 17% and on a national basis the construction industry predicts that there will be 8,000 fewer houses constructed this year than last year which reflects a total downturn of 17%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> In light of these facts, does the Taoiseach agree that the ESRI target of 100,000 over the next five years cannot be achieved? Does he agree that policy is failing to deliver the new houses necessary for our young population and that already the dream of owning one's own home is nothing more than a dream that will not be fulfilled for many young people? Will the Taoiseach take a personal interest in this? Everything that has happened in the provision of houses was predicted by us on this side of the House when the third Bacon report was implemented. Will the Taoiseach now get the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to change policy because the housing crisis is deepening on a weekly basis and the proof is there for all to see. There is a massive reduction in housing starts across the country and particularly in the major cities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same subject, does the Taoiseach agree there is now some validity to the concern that there is massive hoarding of building land for which planning permission has been granted and for which services exist to enable development to proceed and that perhaps the time has come for the State to intervene to acquire that land, either by negotiation or under CPO, in order to unblock the hoarding of land which is denying people the right to a home as a result of Government policies? Given that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has indicated that he is aware of the amount of land zoned for residential development for which planning permission has been granted and has expressed his concern, does the Taoiseach agree the Government is aware of the nature of the difficulty? Can he outline what steps, if any, the Government proposes to take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year we built more than 50,000 houses, which was an increase of about 50%. The Government put significant resources into the serviced land initiative, which allowed planning permission to be granted and gave access to an enormous amount of zoned land that is now ready for house building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they been ordered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Part V of the Planning and Development Act contains radical new measures which have got constitutional clearance and will ensure that land is zoned to meet the housing needs. There is validity in the issue raised. There are about 70,000 or 80,000 sites particularly in the greater Dublin area where planning permission has been received. The Minister for Finance has given the resources for the land to get the necessary amenities and facilities. In the past three months of last year and the first three months of this year there has been a huge rise in the number of planning permissions granted nationally. Where land has been zoned, has planning approval and has had the benefit of the serviced <Col N="830" /> land initiative, the Government would like to see house construction proceeding. The Government has made its position clear on Part 5. I know that some people do not like the idea of having affordable houses within the zones. Within the past few days, the Minister has again listed precisely to the industry how Part 5 works and how it should be used. Some sections of the industry have used this as a reason for not commencing work before now on sites for which there is planning approval. I hope the Minister's clarification, which was given personally at meetings with the industry and in his latest circular, will be helpful.</P>
      <P>Local authorities also have their own strategic plans for housing, which have to be in by the end of next month. The Government has increased the housing budget from under £400 million to almost £1.2 billion. All of those measures should assist. We have moved from the position, when this Government took office, in which first time buyers had absolutely no chance of getting a house. We have changed that position successfully&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I put it to the Taoiseach, as he faces into his fifth year in Government, that his housing policy is now an abject failure? The Bacon initiatives have not worked and could not have worked. The Minister for Finance, who brought them in, agreed with me, in effect, when I told him they could not work, but they were imposed on him by other people. There are a number of issues which I wish to put strongly to the Taoiseach. First, the housing market is indivisible. Those who cannot buy a house will be on a local authority housing list and if they are unsuccessful there, they will be looking for rented accommodation. It is not possible to categorise, as Bacon did. Second, land is being hoarded. When this Government introduced a proposal to reduce capital gains tax on building land to 20%, this was to be for a three year period and a rate of 60% was to be imposed if houses were not built on the land by the end of the three years. Instead, the Government abandoned the 60% <Col N="831" /> rate, building land is being hoarded and people cannot get houses.</P>
      <P>Finally, I put it to the Taoiseach that the penal stamp duty imposed on certain sectors of the housing industry has quite predictably reduced the supply of houses. Because of the Bacon initiatives brought in by the Government, the supply of new houses has come down to meet the new demand. That is why the number of new houses being built will drop from 48,000 last year to less than 40,000 this year and will continue to go down until the Government changes policy. The Government is getting increasingly out of touch and, when its members start knocking on doors again, they will find out what young people are saying.</P>

This time last year, all his colleagues on that side of the House were shouting that this was stopping house building. In the provincial papers all over the country, their party was calling for it to be changed. We did change it&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the disgraceful treatment which is now being handed out by some Irish employers to immigrant workers? Immigrant workers came here on foot of permits issued by the Tánaiste and were promised a better life in this country, in some cases through recruitment fairs in which the Government engaged on the European continent and elsewhere across the globe. Does the Taoiseach not <Col N="832" /> consider it incredible, in this day and age, that some Irish employers are treating foreign immigrant workers in exactly the same way that Irish potato pickers were treated in Scotland in the 1930s? It is an absolute disgrace that this is allowed to happen in flagrant breach of the law. What action will the Taoiseach take to correct this? </P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from Deputy Quinn's question, is the Taoiseach aware that many of the nurses who were recruited from the Philippines are leaving their employment in the major Dublin hospitals after just a couple of months service? They are doing so for two reasons. First, they are paid 30% less than Irish nurses and, second, they cannot get affordable accommodation in this city. In effect, they are being discriminated against and that will affect the health services which are already in a shambles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter raised by Deputy Quinn, I agree that the employers concerned are totally wrong. They are not complying with the law and they are exploiting people. I understand that the legislation on permits includes a capacity to withold permits from people who abuse the system. I assure the House that foreign workers coming to live in this country are entitled to the full protection of our labour laws. We make no distinction, in any of the employment legislation passed in this House, between the rights of foreign and Irish or EU workers. Any employer who arbitrarily decides to make such a distinction is committing a very serious offence under Irish labour laws.</P>
      <P>All workers, including foreign workers, can make a complaint and I believe in this instance their representatives are making a complaint to the appropriate authorities. The labour inspectors of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will investigate the complaint of alleged breaches of employment laws. That Department is translating its guide to labour laws into seven of the languages most commonly used by non-nationals who come to this country, to assist them in understanding their full employment rights.</P>
      <P>The Government is determined that the minority of employers who might exploit foreign workers who come to these shores will be brought to book and that Ireland's international reputation as a good place to work is not in any way tarnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that SIPTU and RTE are to be congratulated on the manner in which they have highlighted this flagrant abuse of our law? Would he also agree that it is an indictment on the Tánaiste's Department for her abject failure to bring in the work permit legislation which has been consistently promised in this House to put our system of work permits on a statutory basis? That is still promised but not delivered. Her Department has also failed to <Col N="833" /> provide an adequate number of inspectors to ensure that the legislation which does not distinguish between Irish citizens and foreign workers is properly and effectively implemented right across the country. What will the Taoiseach do? There is no point his crying crocodile tears about exploitation. He has the resources to put justice back into the workplace but will not do it because he does not care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject all of that.  The Deputy knows how the inspectorate works and organised labour's representatives have a tight mechanism for monitoring complaints. The Tánaiste's Department takes tough action in this area. In recent cases, files were given to the Garda for investigation. There is no tolerance of breaches. Normally members of the public, employees or representatives bring them to the inspectorate's attention and it acts accordingly. That will continue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is genuine cause for concern that even since we passed this Bill on Second Stage a couple of weeks ago, surveys continue to show that the state of preparedness of Irish business and of the banking institutions is not what it should be and that we are lagging behind other countries in terms of our state of preparedness for the introduction of the euro. I understand this is the last legislation that is required to allow for the euro to come into circulation at the end of this year. It is vitally important that the Euro Changeover Board is given all the support it clearly requires to get it across to Irish people that the euro is happening and that, more <Col N="839" /> importantly, the punt is about to cease to exist as legal tender.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister, in conjunction with his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to take whatever additional powers may be necessary to ensure that there is not widespread abuse of the changeover for profiteering purposes at the start of next year because I fear, even with the best will in the world, there will be abuse and the legislation we have in place at the moment is not sufficient to allow us to prevent that from happening. We support this Bill. It is an historic shift in our currency which was only independent for 22 years. As I said, this is the last legislation required to signal the change. It will be an interesting and exciting time at the start of next year but, nonetheless, a time to be very vigilant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell. During the earlier Stages of the Bill, my party spokesperson, Deputy Jim Mitchell, gave his full support to the proposals. What Deputy McDowell has said about the need for continuing vigilance is important. With only a few months to go to the official changeover, I am surprised the level of public awareness, knowledge and the discussion about what will be a major event, in a sense, in the lives of people has not appeared to reach any great heights. Admittedly, the advertising campaigns appear to be relatively effective but over the next few months, our efforts must be redoubled to ensure public awareness is at the level it should be and, as Deputy McDowell said, to ensure there is no abuse during the time of the changeover. On behalf of my colleague and party spokesperson, Deputy Jim Mitchell, I wish the Minister well as he brings this important Bill to conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly bear in mind what the Deputies have said. I alluded to this on Second Stage and in reply to parliamentary questions. The Euro Changeover Board of Ireland is a very representative body and is very active in a number of areas. There will continue to be increased advertising and awareness campaigns over the coming months. I note what Deputy McDowell said in regard to businesses being aware of what is going to happen. Forfás has had a very active campaign but I am sure that, as with many things in life, many people will leave things to the last minute. Increasingly, people in the run up to 1 January will be made more aware. The Government is very conscious of the possibility of abuses that will occur on 1 January at the changeover of the currency. Those who are old enough will think back to what happened when decimalisation came along in the early 1970s. We will bear that in mind also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the House for allocating time for consideration of this Bill and the Deputies for their support for it and their contributions on Second <Col N="840" /> and Committee Stages. The Euro Changeover (Amounts) Bill, 2001, is a short and technical Bill. Its main aim is to provide, where necessary, for the replacement of Irish pound amounts in law with convenient amounts in euro to apply from 1 January 2002. Taken together with other similar measures, such as those in the Finance and Social Welfare Acts, the Bill will broadly complete what might be called the euro price list for the more common transactions between the citizen and that State. It embodies an important principle of favouring the citizen where change to convenient amounts is necessary. It represents an important further step in our practical preparations for the introduction of euro notes and coins next January.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>2.&ndash;It shall be a function of the Health Insurance Authority to consider and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the extension of health insurance to the whole population with the objective of creating equality of care.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage and was disappointed that the Minister for Health and Children did not accept it. If anything, that strengthens my resolve to put the case again &ndash; maybe in more detail this time &ndash; to ensure the points I am making in relation to this Bill are taken on board. It is an important Bill which can do more than what it sets out to do if this amendment is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of inequality in our health service, the Government has not stated how it deals or intends to deal with what is a gravely iniquitous two tier system at hospital level which militates against public patients who are forced on to hospital waiting lists, while private patients can fast track care. It is a system that depends on hospital waiting lists for the two tier nature of it to continue. There is a built-in incentive for hospital waiting lists rather than a built-in incentive to get rid of them. Equally, at primary care level, there is a grave inequality as well in terms of the vast bulk of the population having to pay for their visit to the GP even though across <Col N="841" /> Europe this would not be considered acceptable or desirable.</P>
    <P>What we have is a dysfunctional system of health care which has a range of problems, including lack of investment over the years, difficulties in relation to fragmentation of services, geographic inequality, issues relating to management and incentives for good practice. This aspect of equity has not been addressed by this Government. There has not been a declaration as to how this Government will ensure that patients, when they are sick, will be treated as sick people rather than as poor people on the one hand and better off people on the other. It is the central issue in terms of health care reform. Will the Minister accept that in setting up this insurance regulatory authority, there is a resource, a body being established, with a great deal of expertise in the area of health insurance? There is a resource there. A body is being established that will have a good deal of expertise in the area of health insurance. Apart from it being a regulatory authority, part of its task should be to assess the benefits that may accrue from providing a universal insurance scheme. Such an input should not in any way override the policy role of the Minister or Government, although we have not seen much of that policy making in this regard. The body should be a resource to feed in information and direction in terms of knowing how to consider that possibility in an informed way.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister it is not that we are asking that this matter be considered as somehow out of sync with other countries or that this is a bizarre idea the Labour Party has taken on for reasons best known to itself. In examining the issue of health insurance, we considered the position in other EU countries. While there was not a model that could be adopted wholesale to the Irish situation, it was clear health insurance in various forms is not the exception but the rule. It is the norm.</P>
    <P>There is a health insurance system in Austria, compulsory health insurance in Belgium, health insurance is compulsory in France, there are numerous insurance funds in Germany, compulsory health insurance in Greece, a national health service based on compulsory health insurance in Italy, compulsory health insurance in Luxembourg, a complex arrangement that includes health insurance in the Netherlands, a national health service based on compulsory health insurance in Portugal and a mix of taxation and compulsory health insurance in Spain.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to assess the current circumstances. We have a health care system that is essentially an apartheid one which is gravely iniquitous. It has not appeared overnight and it has deepened in its inequality in recent times. Another aspect of the health system is that almost 50% of the population are taking out private health insurance. Those are the circumstances here.</P>
    <P>Many of us might say that if one was setting up a health system, one would not start from here, <Col N="842" /> but we are here. We need to move on to ensure equality is a central element that will be addressed while changes, reforms and the greater investment in our health services occur. That is not what has happened. The budget for Health, which the Minister often trumpets and of which he is proud, has doubled but the returns to the people have not. That increase in the budget has not been seen by the patient on a trolley in an A&amp;E unit, the woman waiting for a hip replacement or by other people living in pain and suffering on a daily basis without any idea when they are likely to get an operation.</P>
    <P>I know of a paraplegic who lives at home and cannot begin his rehabilitation because he is on a waiting list for an operation. That man is in grave pain and his family circumstances are extremely difficult in terms of providing him with care and support, but he is stuck. We all know that if he had enough money to pay for private health insurance his problem would have melted and there would be no problem in his progressing as far as he could into good health.</P>
    <P>The Minister said on Committee Stage that it is not up to an insurance regulatory authority to consider these matters, but he can see the size of the elephant. He is too close to the problem and to the crisis management that is inevitable in the Department of Health and Children. It is an indication that the Government on entering office had not prepared to resolve key issues in the health service and that money is seen as the solution to all the problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister will come back on that and talk about the health strategy. I am pre-empting him by saying the implementation of that strategy will be timed very closely to the next general election. Anybody who reflects on how the Minister is managing and driving policy would question how after four years in Government with unprecedented resources and wealth the Government is only now deciding to develop a policy at the end of its period of office. Due to that absence of policy there was the recent spat between the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Health and Children is saying we need more money and he is right, but he is also wrong because he has not dealt with how to ensure that money will be well spent. The Minister for Finance is saying he will not give him money until he can give him value for money. The Minister for Finance is right, but he is also wrong because health reform requires money, but it also requires that we ensure such money is spent in a way that delivers equality, excellence and value for money. The three are interlinked.</P>
    <P>I would be interested if the Government could tell me why a health insurance system such as we are suggesting will not work. I have no hang ups about it. If there is a better way I would happy to accept it, but I do not see one. I have examined and judged the current circumstances and needs and come up with the best proposal I can. I accept nobody has a monopoly on wisdom. I do not have <Col N="843" /> the resources of the Department of Health and Children. All I have is a secretary and goodwill from various people who want health reform. It is extraordinary we have not had a comprehensive view from the Minister and the Department about why this suggestion cannot at least be examined by the Health Insurance Authority which has actuaries, accountants and other experts in health insurance, otherwise they would not be members of that authority. It is their purpose to carry out a task given to them by the Government to deal with the pressing issues of health reform. Tinkering around it will not solve the problem. I hope that is one lesson that has been learned by everybody.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Health and Children has failed to convince the Minister for Finance about how he wants to spend the money, and that is what happened at Ballymascanlon, it is difficult to see how he can convince anybody else in the community who has experience of the downside of the health service, who has waited in a chair in an A&amp;E unit or on a trolley like the 94 year old man whose case was reported recently in a newspaper article. We need direction on this. We need a comprehensive policy that is also targeted.</P>
    <P>It will be extremely difficult to deliver equality. We all understand that, but the first step is to make clear that the Government is committed to ensuring equality is delivered, not that more private beds are taken out of the public system or private patients are charged the full whack. That would not solve the problems. As Miriam Wiley from the ESRI said, there is a perception that equity is an even bigger problem in the current health system compared to the mid-1990s. Equity is not an easy issue to address and it is perceived at many different levels in terms of the geographical issue, the access issue, the financial issue and so on. I do not think anyone could deny it remains one of the most critical problems to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Government has not made its views on the issue clear even though it says it wants to address it. After four years in Government, the Minister asked very interesting questions at the launch of the health strategy. I find it remarkable that questions are being asked when the problem is so real, pressing and critical that at times people's lives depend on resolving it. Some people would be alive today if they had the money to access the health care they needed. This is why I am tabling the amendment and I ask the Minister to give it consideration. He can give many reasons why this should not be done, such as that the authority has a narrow remit or it will do this, that or the other, but he cannot tell me that if he includes this aspect in the Bill it will not happen because it is easy to set the task for the authority. This is an important aspect which must be put in place if we are to ensure we are making progress on the issue of equal access to health care.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take on board what I am saying and not lose the opportunity because of <Col N="844" /> some narrow political desire to make a point or simply because he wants to hold on to this health strategy to sell Fianna Fáil at the next election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I see a number of young girls in the public gallery and I hope they will grow up in a fairer society than the one we inherited and in which we live.</P>
      <P>The unfairness of the system is such that if one is wealthy and can pay for health care, one will live longer, in less pain and not have to wait in a queue. According to an ESRI report, the death rate for higher professionals over the age of 55 is approximately 13 per 1,000 whereas for poorer people and unskilled workers it is almost three times that number. Men in Ireland die younger than women and men and women in Ireland die younger than they do in France. We accept this as the norm because it has happened for a number of years. It is unacceptable that while there is 100% bed occupancy most of the time in private hospitals, the bed occupancy rate in public hospitals is little over 80%. Recent statistics in some health board areas indicate that it is less than 80%.</P>
      <P>The Minister has called into question figures I published last week pointing out that there were over 1,800 bed closures last year and, if one includes geriatric beds, the figure would be over 2,000. However, I did not say the beds were all closed on the one day. I will submit my figures to an independent audit if the Minister does likewise. The reality is that while more than 30,000 low income people, not the rich or the well off, were on the hospital waiting list last year, beds in public hospitals were closed, and it is forecast that the figures for this year will exceed those for last year. Why is this the case?</P>
      <P>I made it clear in the Fine Gael health proposals that we will engage in a debate on the issue. I also said there should be a White Paper process on a legislative basis for change. We propose extending health insurance cover to everyone through the Exchequer, not just the Exchequer picking up the bill for some people but that everyone would be covered for a basket of hospital services similar to what is available in public hospitals. The effect of that would be that patients would become a source of income to hospitals rather than a charge on hospital budgets, which is currently the case. Everyone who occupies a bed in a private hospital is a source of funding, therefore there is an incentive not to have beds closed. In regard to public hospitals and the block grant system whereby hospitals will not get a per patient flow of funds no matter how many patients are admitted, there is an incentive to keep beds closed rather than open extra beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael's model proposes introducing managed competition whereby the whole insurance area, including BUPA, the VHI and whoever else comes on board as a result of this Bill, could be dramatically reformed to bring fairness to the system so that patients are admitted to hospital based on the state of their health rather than their <Col N="845" /> wealth. That is essentially what is wrong with the system as things stand. However, this is not where one would begin to introduce such dramatic reforms. We would first need to get our ducks in a row in many other areas, so to speak. That is why I have put forward the proposals in the context of many other reforms such as taking the pressure off secondary care and putting it on primary care and giving poor people the opportunity to get a medical card.</P>
    <P>It is absurd that a single person on £101 per week does not qualify for a medical card. It is absolutely outrageous, given that there is an agreement between the IMO and the Government that up to 40% of the population can be covered by medical cards, that only 30.32% or three out of every four people have a medical card, according to a reply to a parliamentary question last week. This means qualifying rates have been set very low, that is, £101 for a single person and £85.50 if that person is single and living at home.</P>
    <P>Poor patients who do not have a medical card tend not to go to the doctor because they cannot afford the fees. The health of these patients then deteriorates. Perhaps they smoke more because they have nowhere else to turn or they have no money to pursue other activities. These are the people who end up on hospital waiting lists. I say to the Minister that the health insurance proposal being put forward is not being put forward on its own but as part of a comprehensive set of proposals to completely reform the health system. These include a whole new management structure for hospitals, including accountability, a covenant of rights and responsibilities, an ombudsman to oversee the system and investment in primary care so that people can see their doctors, followed by investment in secondary care together with managed competition. This would transform the system.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be critical of the proposals being put forward by saying they will not work. I do not know if his attention has been drawn to an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 29 May by Moore McDowell entitled &ldquo;Health insurance for all is the answer to our hospital waiting list problems&rdquo;. While the Minister, Deputy McManus and I may have different views on this issue, surely Deputy McManus's amendment that we should ask the Health Insurance Authority to consider and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the extension of health insurance to the whole population with the objective of creating equality of care is a worthy proposal. The amendment proposes that we should not rely on what is in the Labour Party or Fine Gael documents or on what comes out of the Fianna Fáil document, after its fifth year in office, when the Minister publishes his proposals. It proposes that an independent authority should consider the issue. Let us have some independent authority look at the issue so that we can be assured it is an honest broker who has laid down the case for and against.</P>
    <P>I would be quite happy to submit my case to that authority and, therefore, support this amend<Col N="846" /> ment. It would be a good day's work if we were to get an independent authority, such as the Health Insurance Authority, which will have expertise in this area and will not be in the pocket of VHI or BUPA or anybody else who comes into the market. If we looked at the issue independently we could say that it was a whole new ball game with what appeared to be three players in the market and that there was an opportunity for managed competition now under these new circumstances. Our job is to give leadership and to try to bring about fairness and justice. The greatest injustice and the most unfairness in any area of public policy is in the area of health. That is wrong and I hope that those girls in the Public Gallery will see the system completely reformed by the time they come to adulthood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the remit of the Health Insurance Authority is defined in the White Paper related to the operation and maintenance of the common good aspects of our private health insurance. We are giving additional functions to the authority in terms of risk equalisation. A whole system of risk equalisation will be put in place to facilitate stability within a competitive marketplace. It was never in the White Paper or in the drafting of this Bill that the Health Insurance Authority would become a health policy authority or become some super health policy advisory body to political parties or the Government. Calling on the authority or providing a legislative facility for the authority to study or look at the whole question of extending compulsory health insurance to the population does that. It is open to political parties and the Government to bring forward any proposals they wish in relation to this or to commission specific expert advice on the advisability of moving to another system.</P>
      <P>Our own health strategy did ask Deloitte &amp; Touche, in the context of the value for money audit, to have a look at different funding methodologies. In essence what we are talking about here is a funding methodology. It would have implications in terms of how health care would be managed and how priorities would emerge and also have implications for the strategic direction of the health service. Basically, we are looking at different methods of funding the system and irrespective of what our funding methodology is, we still have the same key issues that need to be addressed in terms of the capacity of the system to deal with demand. We have to deal with reform in terms of human resources, medical manpower reform and reform of all those working within the health care system itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inevitably, irrespective of our funding methodology, we will have to look at the modernisation of the health infrastructure which has suffered from under-investment over the last 20 to 30 years. In addition, the whole area of general practice requires fundamental review and modernisation. What is at issue here, whatever political <Col N="847" /> party's view emerges, is that people will have to make choices.</P>
    <P>On Deputy McManus' proposition, the Labour Party would not have the same expertise or backup as Government. We are consulting with a whole range of groups on the formulation of the new health strategy. The health strategy is not about the election. Elections come and go. The last health strategy was 1994 and was developed under a Fianna Fáil and Labour Party Government. It was indeed a Labour Party Minister for Health who developed the first health strategy. It was a good start in terms of bringing in the concept of a strategic approach. The ESRI pointed out some flaws in terms of evaluation, monitoring, targets, etc., which we are considering in the formulation of a new health strategy. When the Government changed to the Rainbow in 1996 they continued with that health strategy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The factual objective reality is that the Fianna Fáil/Labour Government formulated a health strategy under Deputy Howlin as Minister for Health in 1994. The Rainbow continued with that policy. We should be mature enough in the House to follow through on strategic visions adopted by particular Governments in relation to the health system. There may be fundamental policy differences but in fact there have not been so many over the years. I could go right back to Dr. Noel Browne's time when his mother and child scheme was followed up and implemented by the Fianna Fáil Party. We have had a strong commitment to social justice and I hope Deputy McManus does not suggest otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Issues such as the manpower forum report, a policy initiative of my predecessor Deputy Cowen, which heralds a fundamental change in terms of the way we operate within the hospital system from a medical manpower perspective, will ultimately lead to a consultant provided service as opposed to a consultant-led service. That is fundamental policy development but it was done in consultation with the partners and it took time as agreement had to be negotiated. Likewise, the cardiovascular strategy was a very formative piece of policy making, also developed under Deputy Cowen. It will have an impact in terms of the prevalence of heart disease here. The national cancer strategy was formulated under Deputy Noonan's period in office but very little money was allocated to it. This Government allocated huge money to the cancer strategy. We did not dismiss it because it was another Govern<Col N="848" /> ment's policy. We kept the framework, built on it and developed it.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has been very scarce with detail in relation to the extension and its policies in terms of compulsory health insurance. I do not concede that because one is in Opposition one cannot provide details. I was in Opposition for three and a half years with three years on the Education brief. It fell on me to come up with policies right across the length and breadth of the education spectrum which I did with the assistance of people involved in education and the Department.</P>

There is an awful lot to do in the health service in the next ten years to deal with additional demands caused by the increase in, and the ageing of, the population. The proposals in this amendment are neither suitable nor appropriate as they are not within the remit of the Health Insurance Authority which is given a fundamentally regulatory role in this Bill. The authority will investigate, research and develop health insurance policy for the political system. There are other ways of meeting the requirements of the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is a little rich on the part of the Minister for Health and Children to seek detailed costings from me, given that I recently received an apologetic letter from the Department of Finance. I sought information needed to draw up costings of the Labour Party's proposal, which we are working on as best we can. The Department of Finance apologised in the letter for not being able to give me the essential information I needed as the Department of Health and Children would not provide it. I can give the Minister, Deputy Martin, a copy of the letter if he wishes, but for him to come to the House to complain that I cannot provide detailed costings is a bit rich. One of the reasons it is not possible for me to provide the information is that his Department will not supply the details I need. The Minister needs to be aware of the facts as I am tired of his feeble response to proposals aimed at providing a quality system. The proposals were presented to the Minister to engage him in debate, but he has refused consistently to deal with them or put forward his own ideas for dealing with inequality. It is not right to say there are no policy differences on this issue.</P>

      <P>I reject Deputy McManus's comments as I do not accept her protestations that the Labour Party was incapable of providing a detailed policy position. The descriptions of the party's documents differ as sometimes they are called discussion documents and sometimes policies. I have provided the Deputy with figures in relation to the cost of free GP care and medical cards. Given the Labour Party's experience in Government during the last 15 years, when it has <Col N="850" /> had responsibility for my Department, and given the fact that the party has travelled all over Europe to look at other insurance systems, I find it difficult to comprehend that the party has not provided a more detailed policy exposition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the issue of delivering equality and a new dispensation within the health service. The Minister should seek the views of the Health Insurance Authority, which will have a pool of ready made expertise. As time goes by, the authority will amass considerable experience of the benefits, downsides and drawbacks of the health insurance system we have or potentially could have. It is clear to everyone other than the Minister that the authority is a valuable resource that can be used to look at the issue. It is particularly apparent that the resources within his Department are pretty limited when the only response I receive is that the Labour Party has not costed its proposals. I presume the Minister has the resources to shoot down my argument should he wish, but that does not appear to be the case as he constantly kicks to touch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new resource is provided by the regulatory authority as it will have a pool of people who are highly experienced in the insurance area. They have no political axe to grind, are not necessarily radical reformers and may not even be committed to providing equality within the health system. They are well placed, however, to carry out an assessment of the implications. I presume the Government will have to come up with some ideas before the general election and it should determine that this issue is a key one, as we have money and the resources to deliver a quality service for the first time ever. There is no point in looking back, even though demands for equality in the health care system have been made from <Col N="851" /> all sides of the political spectrum. Economically, we are in a position to reach high and ensure that equality is delivered. All I seek is that we ask the Health Insurance Authority to deliver an assessment of the potential of this mechanism to provide quality care on an equal basis. It is a great pity that the Minister for Health and Children is unable to take a small step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 3 seeks the deletion from the Bill of terms which prohibit cash plans from paying benefits direct to health service providers. This requirement is intended to ensure that a clear distinction is maintained between cash products and indemnity products. In the interests of clarity for consumers, I want to minimise the possibility of the situation recurring, such as that dealt with by Deputy Noonan as Minister for Health, where a question could arise concerning the establishment of a lego effect <Col N="852" /> between risk rated cash and community rated indemnity plans. The intention in the section as published is to keep clear blue water between these two different types of insurance.</P>
      <P>Based on the evidence available to my actuarial advisers, it is certainly the case here and in the United Kingdom that benefits payable under cash plans are predominantly paid to the individuals rather than to service providers. An inquiry made by officials in my Department during the course of recent discussions with a major UK cash plan provider confirmed that as benefits are paid directly to the customer, a provision of the kind contained in the Bill was not a particular matter of concern or objection. We want to keep clear blue water between cash products and indemnity products. That is why I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this on Committee Stage. It is not considered necessary to include these words in the definition. Health insurance business is defined in the 1994 Act as meaning the business of effecting health insurance contracts. We must, therefore, look to the 1994 Act's definition of health insurance contract. Such contracts are defined as being contracts of insurance, or any other insurance arrangement, which would provide for the making of insurance or any other insurance arrangements which provide for the making of payments, especially for the discharge or reimbursement of charges in respect of the provision of hospital in-patient facilities or ancillary health services. The Act further specifies that hospital in-patient services and out-patient services have the meaning accorded to them in the Health Act, 1970, that is to say, services of such a kind to be provided within the functional area of a health board. Therefore, health insurance contracts relate to health services to be provided to persons within the State.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill cannot in any way impinge upon the right of insurers who are authorised to conduct the relevant class of business covering sickness insurance in another EU member state to engage in the provision of such services to Ireland on a service basis. Under the EU directive, an insurer is not obliged to establish an office or branch in another member state as a condition of engaging in business there.</P>
      <P>We previously received legal opinion on other matters which touch materially on this subject. That legal opinion stated that the term &ldquo;health insurance contract&rdquo; does not cover the provision of hospital in-patient services or ancillary health services where those services are contracted to be provided to somebody who is outside the State and, save in limited circumstances, will be provided outside the State.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(e) the insertion of the following definition after the definition of &lsquo;the Registrar':</P>
      <P>&ldquo;relevant risk&rdquo; shall be construed in accordance with section 12(10)(a);',&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 proposes the insertion of a new subparagraph; amendments Nos. 13, 14, 18 and 24 propose substituting the word &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;insured&rdquo;; and amendment No. 23 proposes in page 16, lines 4 to 6, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;insured&rdquo; in line 4, down to and including &ldquo;the&rdquo; in line 6 and substi<Col N="854" /> tute &ldquo;relevant risks is a reference to risks of such class or nature as may be prescribed which have been respectively insured by the registered&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am advised that those technical amendments would ensure the comparison of the nature and distribution of risks among registered undertakings is carried out on the basis of comparable risks. That is the objective of the amendments. We had some discussion on this on Committee Stage, and the Minister was not particularly well disposed to the amendments. I raise them again in the hope that the Department officials have had an opportunity to consider them in the meantime. Will the Minister consider accepting the amendments? What are his views on the distribution of risks among registered undertakings? Would this provide a basis for comparable risks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very extensive discussion on these amendments on Committee Stage because they touch fundamentally on the whole area of risk equalisation and how it will operate. My view on the imperative of having risk equalisation to underpin our community rating system has not changed. It is important to appreciate that at all times, even going back to the introduction of the Principal Act, it has been indicated by successive Ministers that risk equalisation would be a central feature of our health insurance policy and regulatory framework. It is also important to bear in mind that risk equalisation measures are permitted under the EU's Third Non-Life Directive. We are in no doubt about that arising from our extensive contacts with the EU Commission's Services. Our private health insurance system operates on the principle that insurers must accept all comers, irrespective of their age or health status, and charge them a standard premium for a given level of cover. In other words, insurers cannot be selective about the risks they will cover or the price they will charge. This also means there is solidarity between the young, the old, the healthy and the sick. People do not have to buy health insurance, so clearly their trust and confidence in the long-term stability of the system is vital if this solidarity is to be maintained.</P>
      <P>I went into considerable detail on the value and importance of risk equalisation to the entire system. It is important to realise, even for consumers of health insurance, that there is a serious danger that if the market were to be destabilised and significant variations in risk profiles emerged and some insurers ended up with a younger, healthier population, they would be able to charge a lower premium. The other side of the coin is that the premia will inevitably rise for those insurers who are left with a higher proportion of less healthy individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I drew attention to two real situations where the absence of risk equalisation caused difficulties in international health insurance markets. One of the situations was instability experienced in the Netherlands during the 1970s and 1980s where market equilibrium was unravelled by risk selection and premium dif<Col N="855" /> ferentiation. The second is the case of a German sickness fund. The German insurer concerned, BKK Stadt Hamburg, has recently run into serious financial difficulties due to the high cost of health care in the Hamburg region and the fact that the fund has experienced a disimproving claims ratio due to a loss of younger, healthier clients for which it was not adequately compensated by the existing German risk equalisation system. The German Government commissioned an expert group to review the development of the risk equalisation system. The group reported in February and recommended that the existing risk equalisation system be strengthened.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed amendment, the purpose and intended impact of introducing the term &ldquo;relevant risks&rdquo; is unclear. Furthermore, its intended replacement of the term &ldquo;insured risks&rdquo; throughout the Bill is unsatisfactory. The definition refers one to section 12(10)(a) of the Bill but when one gets there all one finds is that it involves a reference to risks of such a class or nature as may be prescribed. This does not take the Legislature very far in terms of knowing what it is providing for nor does it provide much to go on as regards the formulation of regulations pursuant to the Legislature's wishes.</P>
    <P>The definition provides the basis for a number of other amendments which seek to remove a reference to the risks as represented by the entire insured population, who have traditionally contributed to and enjoyed the benefits of intergenerational solidarity through community rating, and replace it with a more selective but unspecified concept of relevant risks. There would have to be a full explanation of what this concept involves, whom it would benefit and how it would support the application of community rating across the insured community before it could be understood, let alone adopted as law.</P>
    <P>If the intention is to permit segmentation of the market or in any way impede the flow of intergenerational transfers which underpin effective community rating, this would not be acceptable and does not appear to support the broad solidarity principle which has underpinned the country's community rating system of voluntary private health insurance for many years.</P>

    <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage. I asked the Minister to consider whether section 2 of the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1996, might be strengthened and improved by the proposal to include the words &ldquo;and may provide such other services, including services to persons outside the State, as it may think fit&rdquo;. Is the Minister satisfied that section 2 of that Act is satisfactory or would he agree that this amendment would improve the health insurance industry and confer on health insurers a power that would be beneficial to them?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments relate to or arise from the inclusion of an amendment to the Bill to extend the powers of the VHI in relation to the products and services it is empowered to provide. On Committee Stage the amendment I brought forward to address this issue was accepted. This now stands as section 12 of the Bill, so progress was made in extending the range of products and services the VHI can offer. Section 12 should be sufficient to meet the needs of the board, pending legislation to address the matter of its corporate status.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 would give the VHI undefined powers in the services it could provide and would represent a departure from the existing legislative structure, which requires the approval of the Minister of the day to propose schemes of health insurance. It would give the VHI the power to provide any services it saw fit to provide. However, on its existing status the VHI is not an authorised insurer for the purpose of carrying on either life or non-life insurance business in accordance with the prudential and other requirements of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is considered that the proposed amendment would conflict with the existing legislative framework which requires the approval of the Minister of the day to new schemes and the VHI's exemption from meeting the normal requirements for authorisation as an insurer. It is considered appropriate, therefore, that any new schemes should be subject to the approval of the Minister and, where necessary, any regulatory or other conditions he or she may deem appropriate.</P>
      <P>The unspecified approach could give rise to competition issues with other insurers if the VHI were to engage in new forms of business without complying with the required general insurance regulatory provisions. In that context, I cannot accept amendment No. 31. Its acceptance could be construed as meaning that the VHI was authorised to offer health insurance outside the State. The VHI is not an authorised insurer under the general body of insurance legislation as administered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and is not, therefore, in a position to offer health insurance in another jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment we made on Committee Stage is sufficient at this stage of the process. The over<Col N="857" /> all issue will have to await change in terms of the corporate status of the VHI and further measures that will be put in place in that regard.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 3, to delete &ldquo;Any&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Subject to subsections (2) and (3), any&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 provides that subsection (1) &ldquo;does not apply to any arrangement entered into by an employer whereby he or she agrees to discharge the whole or part of an excess amount payable by an insured person or reimburse, in whole or in part, such a person in respect of the payment by the person of such an amount&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendments arise from a recent approach by Bupa to my Department. Bupa advised that the provisions of section 4 could impact on products it currently offers. This matter was not specifically raised by Bupa in previous discussions with the Department. Bupa drew attention to the excess provision contained in some of its existing products. These products provide that where an episode of private hospital care is required, the person named on the contract bears a liability, depending on the insurance plan involved, of between £50 and £100 of the costs that arise. Such amounts are stated in the policy and are generally referred to as deductibles. It advised that in some cases employers are paying these amounts on behalf of employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed amendment provides that in such situations the payment of the excess amount <Col N="858" /> by the employer will not be deemed to be a health insurance contract. The proposed amendment has been framed so that deductibles are permitted but liabilities, which arise due to the insured person availing of care in a higher level hospital than that provided by his or her insurance, are not.</P>
    <P>While I have brought forward this amendment to avoid the possibility of impinging upon existing business practice, I emphasise that any significant expansion of self-insurance by employers would be a potential threat to the stability of community rating and it is not the intention to facilitate such developments as evidenced by the thrust of the section. I would not envisage, therefore, that the amount which may be prescribed would be increased significantly in the future and consider that any possible impact of the exemption on community rating will have to be kept under review. We have provided for a figure of £100 in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment states:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;excess amount' means an amount (not being an amount that exceeds £100 or such other amount as may be prescribed or that is payable to the insurer) . . .</P>

      <P>I take it that is by order. Amendment No. 10, seeks to amend page 6, between lines 18 and 19, to insert a new subsection. The purpose of my amendment is that the principal Act of 1994 would make clear that employers are capable of carrying out certain acts. On Committee Stage I stated that section 4 inserted a new section 2A in the principal Act and the purpose of that was to ensure that employers would be prevented from self-insuring their work force. According to the view which has been expressed to me, this would also prevent employers from meeting any costs which an employee would have to pay because he or she was beyond the cover provided by his or her insurance, for example, in respect of a pre-existing condition excluded by the insurer. In my amendment, I am trying to make clear that such employers would not be required to register as health insurers. If the Minister can assure the House that this is not necessary and that what I am seeking can be done without this provision, I am happy to accept that, but one reading of this is that some employers may not be allowed to do what I am seeking because they would have to register as health insurers, if the legislation remains as it stands. I want the Minister to consider that point. We teased this out on Committee Stage. Is the Minister satisfied that the provisions are satisfactory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point on this. However, I am concerned about how his amendment is framed because there are potential dangers for community rating. The Minister's amendment states that the excess amount means &ldquo;an amount (not being an amount that exceeds £100 or such other amount as may be prescribed&rdquo; by regulation, as the Minister says, or that is payable to the insurer. I realise that now we will talk about regulations and the system of accountability to this House. If in the future a change was made, would the Minister be constrained by having to come back to the House or to lay regulations before the House, or if it is in order can he simply make an order to change this? There is a potential at least to create a certain amount of unfairness in the system. It may be a slight danger but I would like to be clear that when the Minister says he would make an order, is that something which he would make and which nobody need know about apart from those who would benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a problem with Deputy Mitchell's amendment No. 10 in so far as it provides that an employer, who agrees to reimburse or discharge the fees or charges incurred by employees or any dependent of an employee in respect of hospital in-patient services, will be deemed to be carrying on a health insurance business and will be subject to the amended legislation. An opportunity for significant self-insurance of this kind on the part of employers would have the effect of damaging community rating by removing a predominantly young and healthy population from the general risk pool. Clearly such a development, which is common practice among large employers in the United States, would threaten the solidarity between generations which underpins community rating, and providing scope for the development of risk-rated gap insurance products by insurers would have a similar effect.</P>
      <P>The amendment, if accepted, would provide an opportunity for insurers to segment the employer paid portion of the market by offering the minimal level of cover permitted under the regulatory system on a community-rated basis and cover for anything above that on a risk-rated basis. I do not see the opening of the door to such practices as enhancing the strength of community rating going forward.</P>
      <P>I have brought forward an enabling amendment, which I just dealt with along with amendment No. 8, which bears on this area in the light of practice in the employer paid sector of the market which was very recently brought to the attention of the Department. That moves to cover existing products, but the Deputy's amendment would really open the door to employer self-insurance across the market and that would clearly undermine the community rating principle, which has been that of successive Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the regulations, there is an amendment to which we will come which relates specifically to <Col N="860" /> the risk equalisation scheme and that would have to be brought back to the House for affirmation. However, in terms of this part of the Bill, the existing situation applies and, therefore, the Minister could introduce a regulation. That regulation could be annulled by the House. I take Deputy McManus's point, that in the future it is subject to the disposition of the Minister of the day. On the other hand it would be unusual to set in stone a fixed amount forever and that would require the introduction of primary legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand the Minister's reasoning regarding my amendment No. 10.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this would prevent the employer, if things are left as they are, from meeting any costs which an employee would have to pay because he or she was beyond the cover provided by his or her insurance, for example, in respect of a pre-existing condition excluded by the insurer. If somebody had a pre-existing condition, which is excluded by the insurer, is the Minister telling the House that employers could meet this and that it would not be necessary for these employers to register as health insurers? Supposing a person has a pre-existing condition and, therefore, cannot get insurance cover for that condition. In such a case if the employer of that person has a scheme whereby the employer will pick up the insurance costs not covered because of the pre-existing condition, does that employer have to register?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Minister's amendment, while he rejects the Fine Gael amendment because there is a danger of creating unfairness or difficulties with community rating, he has not convinced me that will not happen on foot of his amendment. While the limit is being set at £100 the door to extend it remains open &ndash; I may be wrong on this and I am willing to learn. One could imagine this becoming quite an issue, particularly if an insurer is keen to get around community rating, for many of the larger international companies operating here who offer to pay health insurance for their employees in order to hold on to them.</P>
      <P>I have been very supportive of the general thrust of this Bill. Can the Minister assure me that the situation I have outlined will not arise as a result of the introduction of this amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McManus has been very supportive of the principle of community rating and risk equalisation. One has to adopt a balanced approach on this issue. We are setting a <Col N="861" /> very low limit of £100. I cannot guard against future Ministers introducing different regulations. I cannot offer any guarantees against what future Ministers could do in this area. Future Governments may have a different perspective on the risk equalisation issue and could bring forward changes to whatever regulatory scheme we introduce. I cannot offer the Deputy any guarantees on that front other than to point out that we have introduced a very low limit by way of seeking to cover products already in the market. This matter was brought to our attention by a particular insurer. It was never our intention to impinge on other products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Regulations prescribing a scheme under this section shall not be made unless a draft thereof has been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister has tabled an amendment to the same section. I am concerned about the regulations which will govern the risk equalisation scheme. On principle, I think all regulations should be debated by this House as part of overall legislation. The ombudsman was very critical of another area of health care where regulations were not open to scrutiny.</P>
      <P>As regards the risk equalisation scheme, it is very important that a draft be approved by both Houses before the workings of the regulatory authority and its terms of reference are proceeded with. I would like to thank the Minister's officials for providing us with a briefing of this very technical area. Deputy Mitchell and I very much appreciate the fact that we are able to discuss this issue with them.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would be considering the risk equalisation scheme in the context of introducing a range to deal with an imbalance between insurers and that the trigger point would be set at between 2% and 10%. He also said this would be prescribed for in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to the regulations. That seems to me to be very wide ranging in terms of its impact. Let us say the authority waited until the 10% limit had been reached before taking action. At 10%, one could be, unnecessarily, doing major, or even mortal, damage to one insurer simply because the authority has that range of judgment. That is not very prac<Col N="863" /> tical. The 10% limit is very high in terms of the scheme actually working and delivering the protections and safeguards it is designed to deliver. The figure previously mentioned &ndash; I do not recall it in the Bill &ndash; may be included in the regulations.</P>
      <P>I would express grave and serious objection if this range were prescribed in the regulations. We need to take another look at that issue. It is important that we take this opportunity to ensure the regulations are laid before and approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas. This is a very important part of the work of the authority, it is probably the central part of its work. It is also a very important issue in terms of ensuring stability in the health insurance market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to thank the departmental officials for their detailed briefing on risk equalisation and the Minister for his courtesy in making them available to us.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that the characteristics of the arrangements relating to any commencement of risk equalisation are that it would be based on the exercise of a major discretion by the HIA as an independent authority and that it would commence only in certain circumstances where material distortion emerges in the risk profile of insurers. As Deputy McManus stated, material is being defined as between 2% and 10%. It would be open to the HIA to take account of all relevant considerations in the exercise of its discretion but they must have regard to the facilitation of competition and must be satisfied to recommend the commencement of risk equalisation in the overall best interests of health insurance consumers and notification to insurers of proposed action as regards the commencement &ndash; opportunity for insurers to make representations &ndash; must be taken into consideration before finally determining the action to be taken. They are the characteristics which surround the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and other members of my party agree with the introduction of a range from 2% to 10%. The risk equalisation scheme will, according to the briefing we have received and the understanding we have of this Bill, require the approval of each House and the Minister will submit an annual report by the HIA to each House in the event of risk equalisation transfers having come into play. These regulations are of such significance that it would not be possible for us to agree to them simply being laid before the Houses or being placed in the Library. We will require a debate on them in this House. We will have to give some careful attention to the regulations because the devil could be in the detail. We need to make sure that we get it right. That is my main concern about the regulations. The undertakings given by the Department of Health and Children and the characteristics which the Department have set out are certainly an improvement on the situation as discussed on Committee Stage. I ask the Mini<Col N="864" /> ster to give an undertaking to the House that the regulations when made will be brought before the House for debate and for detailed consideration because it is an area of concern to us.</P>

      <P>My amendment No. 30 meets the requirements of both Deputies, and is to ensure that any risk equalisation scheme must come back to this House for affirmation and that a motion to that effect, a resolution approving of the draft, must be passed by each House. This was discussed on Committee Stage and I am happy to bring forward amendment No. 30, in line with the commitment I gave on Committee Stage, to give effect to that. Between now and draft resolution stage, we will be reflecting on what Deputies McManus and Gay Mitchell have said.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the appropriate time for the discussion on the detail of the deregulatory scheme is when it comes back to the House in the form of a resolution to be approved by the House.</P>

      <P>In page 13, to delete lines 9 to 22 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  the making of payments by registered undertakings to the Authority of such amounts as may be determined by the Authority in such manner and by reference to such matters as may by regulations be prescribed,</P>

      <P>I hope when the Minister is drafting his regulations he will take into account some of the points I have raised in these amendments. Amendment No. 22 proposes amendments which would require the Minister and the Health Insurance Authority to consider whether risk equalisation is necessary by reference to three criteria, and I set out the criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not press these amendments because it would be preferable to discuss this detail when the regulations are laid before the House. I ask the Minister to consider the points made in these <Col N="865" /> amendments to see whether they can be accommodated in the regulations.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 22, after &ldquo;undertakings&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the reduction of hospitalisation costs through prevention and disease management programmes and coverage of services in non-hospital settings&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is about the assessment of the performance of an insurer. I have expressed concerns about the difficulties and I can see that it is not possible to have a scientific formula to measure performance in terms of costs, but there is a very strong emphasis on age and gender which makes sense. However, it seems that there is still a risk that inefficiency can be rewarded within the risk equalisation scheme if the ways of measuring the costings are not as efficient as possible.</P>
      <P>Good practice should be encouraged, and good practice would be the reduction of hospitalisation costs, preventative health care and promotion and care in non-hospital settings. We are all agreed that too many people end up in hospital and it is very costly. I raised this matter on Committee Stage and explained the thinking behind it which is that good practice should be rewarded and not penalised.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his response was open to the principles in the amendment and he did say that we could return to the issue on Report Stage. We are now on Report Stage, and I do not think the Minister has come up with anything to address this issue.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to respond because there is a serious intent in the amendment which must be addressed. It may require to be addressed in the bigger context of health reform but we should adapt and apply good principles even within a largely technical Bill such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The principles behind the amendment are ones with which I would not quibble in terms of the emphasis on prevention and disease management programmes. The proposed risk equalisation framework deals with episodes of in-patient care. However, it does not prevent insurers focusing, in the first instance, on primary care. Under the proposed framework, risk equalisation will incorporate up to 50% of the claims experience of the insurer concerned and 50% of the market experience. As risk equalisation will not compensate in full for the differences in risk profiles of different insurers, and any transfers arising will be based on the costs of the insurer who will have to make the payment, insurers relying on necessary or inefficient in-patient treatment will be disadvantaged by the proposed scheme and would be better off avoiding hospital <Col N="866" /> treatment if possible. Similar provision will be made in due course when the risk equalisation scheme is to incorporate diagnostic related groups as only the more serious procedures will form part of the risk equalisation pool. It is intended that, ultimately, risk equalisation will be case mix based, with a focus on equalising only more resource intensive types of in-patient discharges.</P>
      <P>The proposed framework for risk equalisation focuses on hospital care as episodes of such care represent most of the overall health insurance claims costs and, in addition, the frequency, diversity and nature of primary care benefit structures make their inclusion in a risk pool particularly problematic and difficult to justify on a cost benefit basis.</P>
      <P>Another practical difficulty in adopting the Deputy's amendment concerns the ability to quantify, cost and verify the reduction in hospitalisation costs which arise from prevention and disease management. The Department has looked at that but there is a question about how it could be done. Before an element such as this could be adopted into law, there would need to be a definitive method for quantifying everything and it would be extremely difficult if not impractical. The approach being taken, not to fully equalise insurers' experience as regards utilisation of hospital services, is considered to strike the necessary balance as regards the recognition of other non-hospital approaches to the treatment and management of illness and disease.</P>

      <P>In page 13, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;<i>(b)</i> It shall be the duty of the Minister and the Authority to ensure that where any provision is made for the making of payments of the kind referred to in paragraph <i>(a),</i> the need for such payments to be made is kept under review and reported on annually to the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 would require any risk equalisation regulations to be kept under review and be reported on annually to the Oireachtas. Given that that is achieved by the Minister's amendment No. 26, I do not intend to press it to a vote. I am pleased the Minister has taken on board the objective of my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> Amendment No. 17 &ldquo;In page 13, line 27, after &ldquo;paragraph <i>(c)</i>&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall only have effect for so long as the Minister determines&rdquo; would empower the Minister to provide for the duration of any payments under the risk equalisation scheme. I do not know whether the Minister intends to provide for a section of this kind in the regulations which he will bring forward. Perhaps he would address this matter when replying.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain subsection (4) of amendment No. 26 before we decide on this amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 26 meets the central requirement of amendment No. 16 which seeks to provide that the authority would report annually on risk equalisation payments. I indicated on Committee Stage that I would provide for that. It strengthens the role and independence of the authority while ensuring that the Oireachtas can have an appropriate oversight of developments in this key area of regulatory provision. I accept that risk equalisation is a necessary support to the effective operation of community rating and open enrolment. As a result of that the Oireachtas should be kept informed of developments on the issue.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 17, it must be fully appreciated that risk equalisation is essentially a stability measure and as such should not be inconsistent in its application. I know of no other country where risk adjustment measures are organised on an intermittent basis. This approach of itself would promote uncertainty and instability in the regulatory process and it would certainly represent a less than effective counter to the incentive of insurers to engage in risk selection. It ignores the fact that risk equalisation only redistributes risk differences that exist and addresses the situation where one part of the insured population has to pay materially more for cover simply because the insurer is unfortunate enough to have a higher risk population. Where these differences cease to exist or where the risk profiles begin to converge the impact of risk equalisation diminishes proportionately. Given that it is an ongoing process we are not in a position to accept amendment No. 17.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) of amendment No. 26 states:</P>
      <P>The reference in subsection (1) to health insurance consumers shall be construed in accordance with section 12(10)<i>(a)</i>(i).</P>

      <Col N="868" /> In page 17, line 4, to delete &ldquo;36&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;18&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This matter was discussed on Committee Stage. It seems to us that 36 months is a long time when the White Paper proposed an 18 months time frame for exemption from the risk equalisation scheme for new insurers. The Minister said there was consultation on this issue following the publication of the White Paper. Is there an implication that those who produced the White Paper did not consult or that the Minister was more vulnerable to pressure. Certainly the risk equalisation is not a new notion but his predecessor put everything on hold. We now have a Bill which provides for an extended start up time. It is important to note this and indicate that the time frame provided for is being extended to a lengthy time frame. It is difficult to see how it can be justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in my name and that of Deputies Neville and Ring is precisely the same amendment as that tabled by Deputy McManus. I share her concerns. I raised these concerns on Second Stage and on Committee Stage. What is the reason for the 36 months time frame? At present VHI and Bupa are in the market. Do we take it from this that there is at least one other, and perhaps more, companies preparing to enter the market? Are insurers preparing to enter the market asked specifically for the 36 months time frame? If the House was to be told that one, two or three more companies were preparing to enter the market and compete I could understand the reason for it. Given that the White Paper made a proposal for 18 months, no reason has been given for it being 36 months, except that the Bill simply carried the amendment. Why do we need a derogation of 36 months in the case of new entrants to the market? I do not consider that the case has been made. There may be a case that we do not know. From where did it come? Are we about to enjoy further competition in the industry? Is it because an applicant or applicants are waiting to enter and have asked for a 36 months time frame? What is the background to it? What was wrong with the 18 months period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The 18 month period has not produced additional competition in the form of new players into the market. It has been a broad objective of successive Governments to increase competition in the health insurance market. There are some indications that people would be interested in coming into the market place. This Bill in so far as it provides for a regulatory framework and the updating of it, is an important factor in anyone's decision to come into the market place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say if there is more than one at this time but there are indications that people are looking seriously at the market. Some <Col N="869" /> people suggest the 18 months start up is not a sufficient window for a new player to come into the market. A period of 36 months gives a greater opportunity for a company to successfully establish itself in the marketplace and then adhere to the risk equalisation regulatory framework. It is designed to facilitate additional competition in the health insurance market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House consents to 36 rather than 18 months, and taking into account that he will be bringing statutory regulations before the House, will the Minister take the opportunity to address the case of entrants to the market that may be subsidiaries of a non-resident insurer? The accounts requirements on the VHI should be the same for Bupa and any new entrant so that they cannot avoid having to publish their full accounts by virtue of being a subsidiary of a non-resident insurer. If we are to have a level playing field and risk equalisation and if we are going to give new entrants up to 36 months, then the Minister and his Department should address the question of transparency in the published accounts of insurers operating here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some doubt about risk equalisation. However, does the Minister agree that the major reason for not having any new entrants is that the Government does not have a position on the future of VHI and this would have a great bearing on an insurer considering entering this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That view was put to me by the VHI very recently. I do not necessarily accept that it is the main reason other players have not come into the market. There are a number of issues and the passing of this Bill will be important in letting insurers know what they are getting into. Many of them have been holding off until the Bill was passed. Deputy McManus is correct in saying that risk equalisation <i>per se</i> does not seem to be a barrier to entry. Issues that were believed to be barriers include the products that could be offered and the window issue. Everybody would accept that there is a start up period before marketing a product for the first time.</P>
      <P>Any company setting up here would have to work within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's regulatory framework for all companies, particularly relating to publishing accounts. The Health Insurance Authority will have to have access to all the accounts, claims. etc., of all the players.</P>

      <P>In page 17, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Performance of functions under Principal Act &ndash; equality of treatment of undertakings.</P>
      <P>12&ndash;The following section is inserted after section 33A (inserted by this Act) of the Principal Act:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;33B.&ndash;Without prejudice to any specific provision of this Act, or regulations thereunder, in that behalf and save where the operation of the provision necessarily requires a difference in such treatment, the Minister and the Authority shall perform the functions conferred on them by or under this Act in such a manner as will result in registered undertakings being treated equally in similar circumstances.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> This amendment follows a discussion on Committee Stage. There is a requirement on anybody dealing with legislation, whether the Minister or a statutory body, to be fair to all parties concerned in relation to its application. Given the wishes expressed by Deputy Mitchell on Committee Stage, I am bringing forward this amendment that will explicitly require the Minister and the authority to treat undertakings equally in similar circumstances. The amendment is framed to show that where there are differences between undertakings and circumstances which require different treatment under the Act, for example, significant differences between the risk profiles of their respective memberships, then the Minister or the authority may discharge their respective responsibilities accordingly.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from this provision, I have every confidence that the independent Health Insurance Authority will conduct its affairs in relation to the operation of a voluntary private health insurance system in a scrupulously fair manner. I am sure the Minister of the day will be no less diligent in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for bringing forward this amendment. It certainly meets in part my concerns raised on Committee Stage and as set out in amendment No. 28. It deals in particular with 21A.(a), which reads &ldquo;does not discriminate unfairly between registered undertakings&rdquo;. The Minister's amendment seems to meet that element of my amendment.</P>
      <P>I am a little disappointed to note that he did not go the whole hog and take on the other proposals contained in my amendment which would require the Minister and the authority to carry out their functions and exercise the powers conferred on them in a manner which promotes competition in the provision of health insurance and protects the interests of consumers, having regard to the need to preserve community rating in the provision of health insurance for essential health care.</P>
      <P>He has provided for the other part of my amendment so I suppose that half a loaf is better than no bread. I am anxious to ensure that the best interests of the consumers are protected, taking into account the need for competition and the need to have stability in the market. However, I am glad we have made some headway on this. It is an improvement in the legislation and so I will not be pressing my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 17, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.&ndash;The following section is inserted after section 21 of the Principal Act:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" />&lsquo;Report to Houses of Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>21B.&ndash;The Authority shall report annually to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the performance of its duties and activities.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister, through his officials, has given an undertaking that the objectives in amendment No. 29, that the authority shall report annually to both Houses of the Oireachtas on the performance of its duties and activities, will be met. I am glad to see that those concerns that were expressed on Committee Stage have also been taken into account. I ask the Minister to confirm that the concerns set out in the amendment will be fully met and the authority will report annually to both Houses.</P>
    <P>In recent years non-commercial State-sponsored bodies have had their remit extended as recommended by a committee which I chaired to ensure that an accounting officer is appointed and that officer will appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. Can the Minister confirm that this will be the case for the Health Insurance Authority? This would ensure that from a financial accounting point of view there would be direct accountability to the House. The Health Insurance Authority should also be available to the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children for examination, from time to time, in relation to the exercise of its duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Mitchell's comments. That there is a safeguard of an annual report requirement in a Bill does not always mean it will be published within a reasonable period. Reports are sometimes so slow to appear that the issues are out of date by the time of publication. This greatly diminishes the value of annual reports. There is also a tendency for Departments to sit on reports. The report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals is one such example. Every year, the effort to get this report out of the Department of Health and Children is just like pulling teeth. These reports are of public interest, they are paid for by the public, they do not belong to Departments and there is an onus to publish them to ensure the public interest is served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In responding to the amendment, I refer the House to Section 33 of the principal Act, which requires the authority to submit an annual report to the Minister, who shall lay it before each House of the Oireachtas. That is already contained in the principal Act. This will ensure that both the Minister and the Oireachtas will be advised of the authority's activities in executing its functions under the legislation. Also, under Section 32 of the principal Act, which relates to Deputy Mitchell's point, the annual accounts must be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit. The Act requires the Minister to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas the said annual accounts, and the <Col N="873" /> Comptroller and Auditor General's report thereon. That also opens the door for the Committee of Public Accounts, if it wishes, to pursue any relevant matter. The provisions of the principal Act require the authority to operate at a high level of accountability and transparency, as well as specifically ensuring that the Oireachtas is kept informed of its activities. This amendment effectively duplicates provisions in the 1994 Act.</P>
      <P>On the point raised by Deputy McManus, the Taoiseach has emphasised that he wants up to date reports from a wide range of bodies. It is important that this new health authority should be in the mode of producing its annual report on time, soon after the end of the year, so that people can discuss it with some degree of relevance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows exactly what I have in mind in this amendment. In the spirit of the debate on Report Stage, I do not intend to introduce a note of controversy, but I would ask the Minister to <Col N="874" /> recognise that, in the appointment of the Health Insurance Authority, there are very well qualified people throughout the country. They do not all have to happen to live in the Minister's bailiwick. I hope the board will be independent and will be seen to be broadly based from the beginning. I will not press the matter any further than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, two minutes will not allow me to say all I wish to say.</P>
      <P>This very worthwhile Bill puts a further block into the fortress against corruption in this State. I have some comments on Sections 4 and 5. In Section 4, a figure of £10,000 is mentioned as a threshold. That seems an extraordinarily high figure. Every person has a price, but I suggest that many people can be bought for significantly less than £10,000. I question the wisdom of such a high threshold.</P>
      <P>The second paragraph of section 4 refers to a complaint being &ldquo;not of sufficient gravity&rdquo; and this issue is taken up again in section 5. Although the legislation is very good, there is a danger that it could be used for spurious accusations, for example, against politicians who are going into an election campaign. On the old Johnsonian adage of letting the individual deny the accusation, damage would be done. There is a weakness in the Bill in this regard. There should be very strong grounds for a complaint and the bona fides of the complainant should be established at a very early stage. There should be no threshold. It should be easy for people to make a complaint, but they should have a solid basis for complaint. There is also a significant lacuna in the Bill. If people make vexatious complaints, particularly for political purposes as part of a political assassination, that should be a criminal offence and such people should face very heavy punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 7, it seems odd that the codes will be established in two different ways. All the codes <Col N="875" /> should be drafted by an independent commission and should be enacted individually. For example, the code for the Dáil should be externally drafted and then adopted by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On balance, this is a good Bill and when it is in place, we will be more scrutinised than any other parliamentarians. It would be welcome if those who scrutinise us, particularly from the media, would acknowledge that. Perhaps those scrutineers should also be subject to appropriate scrutiny mechanisms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments Deputy Roche has just expressed. The further legislation which we are about to enact will ensure that we will become the most scrutinised parliamentarians in western Europe, if not in the entire world of parliamentary democracy. Perhaps, after the events of recent months and years, it might be difficult to disagree with the provisions we are set to enact over the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>This Bill has to be considered in conjunction with the Ethics in Public Offices Act, the electoral Acts and whatever further measures the Government proposes to introduce within its remaining life time. It indicates clearly that Parliament is responding to the public call that politics and politicians operate with the highest standards. It would be politically incorrect of me to disagree with those sentiments. However, we should reflect regretfully on the fact that this is necessary. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has served in this House for many years with distinction. Looking at politics today and the broader context, one must ask if public service has disappeared, or at least is beginning to disappear. If there was a strong view of what public service meant, and if every Deputy and Senator sought and gained election on the ideal of public service rather than self-service, there would be little need for this legislation. Unfortunately, standards have dropped, admittedly in a minority of cases, but it paints a bleak, pitiful picture of our democracy and Government. We must respond with legislation.</P>
      <P>It is a necessary evil and I regret that we, on all sides of the House, feel obliged to agree that this type of monitoring legislation is necessary. As Deputy Roche stated, we will be the most scrutinised parliamentarians in the world. I hope there will be little to scrutinise and that all Members will remain within the confines of what is right and proper. The publicity that some of our colleagues received, and continue to receive, in the tribunals dominates the headlines but they are a tiny minority. What the vast majority of those elected to Dáil Éireann since 1922 have done for their constituencies, constituents and the country is a record to be proud of. It is regrettable that a few drag us down and that this type of legislation is necessary, which it is today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to public service and why people seek election and are willing to go through the strange type of life which politics brings. I hope <Col N="876" /> that the majority do so from the highest ideals. In addition to reforming legislation and putting in the necessary checks and balances, we should consider the broader picture of our system of elections and Government. While we have the multi-seat PR system, we will continue to have social work passing off as politics. People will discuss in this House issues far removed from what they should discuss. Most Oireachtas Members, myself included, will spend most time doing work which is valuable, valid and necessary but ought to be done by properly paid local authority members. This is removed from the debate, but if we seek to paint a stronger, better picture of politics we must examine the existing system. The current one puts too much of a premium on the public representative being little more than a messenger boy. He is often racing against his own constituency colleague. On that point, I am glad to see my colleague, Deputy Stanton, here beside me because that means he is not in the Cork East constituency. We jest about it, but that is the sort of competitive, silly game that the present electoral system engenders. If we want to raise standards we must allow parliamentarians in the national parliament to be serious politicians rather than local messengers.</P>
    <P>Whether the present Government lasts for three months or 12, it cannot be expected to examine in detail the electoral system, but I hope that the next Government will look at it. If we are brave about electoral reform, and take hard decisions on how we elect our parliamentarians and what we want them to be and do, that will be the best step to ensure that they operate at a higher level and standard. Then, perhaps, some of the difficulties we faced in recent years may disappear.</P>
    <P>This legislation gives wide investigative powers into complaints about acts and omissions of persons in public life. If we demanded that ten or 20 years ago, people would have laughed. It is necessary now. It is a strong power that we give. As a number of colleagues said, particularly Deputy Jim Mitchell, it is important to ensure that the inquiry system will place an onus on the complainant to have a valid reason for the complaint. Whether in Government or Opposition &ndash; the roles could be reversed soon &ndash;  we must not abuse these provisions. Deputy Jim Mitchell suffered recently from frivolous complaints. Those who complain must have a serious, genuine complaint. There ought to be a restriction to ensure that someone cannot lob a vague, open ended complaint about a colleague, from one's own constituency or elsewhere, especially in the run up to an election. This would put the accused at a grave, unfair electoral disadvantage. While these powers may be necessary, let us ensure that they are not abused.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for furnishing tax clearance certificates to the commission by persons upon election to either House. If I complained about that I would be politically incorrect. In this brave new world of ethically cleansed politics, we are <Col N="877" /> supposed to be able to flash the tax certificate as soon as we walk inside the confines of Leinster House. So be it. I have no difficulty with that. I wonder how many other jobs with similar responsibility and, in most cases, larger salary than a politicians' require a tax clearance certificate. Last night, Deputy Ring, spoke of the constant, &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo;, examination of the private financial affairs and private property affairs, of politicians.</P>
    <P>The clock has ticked so far in that direction that we cannot stop it. It is unfair that the financial affairs and financial worth of the spouses of politicians can be published and examined. That has very little to do with the broader political issues which should be under consideration. The type of legislation we are now passing will again paint a very unattractive vista for people who might wish to take up a career in public life.</P>
    <P>We frequently bemoan the fact that all the political parties find it difficult to get candidates to stand for elected public office. It is only two years since we had the local council elections. If we are honest about it, all the parties in the majority of council wards and council electoral areas found it difficult to get candidates. There was at least one, if not a second area in which there was not an election because the number of candidates nominated did not exceed the number of vacancies available. That is a sign of a weak democracy and we must seriously ask if the image of politics and the role of the politician has been tarnished so much that people are now unwilling to serve in public life. If that is so, the issue needs to be investigated thoroughly because it is a warning light for democracy if we cannot encourage a sufficient number of people to allow their names to be put forward at election time.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary and cannot be opposed. I hope following its enactment, we ensure it offers fair play to the politicians to the same degree that it will offer fair play to the people making allegations and complaints about political acts or omissions. That is the minimum guarantee we, as politicians, must seek, otherwise the trend over the past five to ten years of our job description being dragged further into the mire will continue.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has given some indications that he might be willing to address the question of the funding of political parties. This is not the occasion to talk about donations and corporate donations, but I hope we will see progress on that issue between now and the next general election. No job is more difficult and demeaning in politics than fund raising, whether at a church gate, at a business lunch or dinner or at a golf outing. It is pathetic that politicians have to prostitute themselves to seek £50 or £100 to run the political process. For some reason in my constituency, we have been able to avoid any of these fund raising dinners or golf outings, and I am glad we have been able to do so. I hope my colleague, Deputy Stanton, agrees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>We may be at a financial loss as a result of not holding some of these events but I would find it distinctly uncomfortable to ask any of my friends or colleagues for a donation, even if it is only £50 or £100. I wonder how some of our colleagues can be so successful in getting teams for golf events at £1,000 per team or whatever. Once one receives anything more than few pounds at a church gate collection or maybe £50 from a £50 draw &ndash; say, £100 or £200 &ndash; there is an uneasy and unholy alliance. We have to put in place an alternative to that. Some 99.9% of fund raising done for political parties, whether it is the £1 at the church gate or the £1,000 golf classic, is done for very genuine reasons. The money is spent for the purposes for which it is sought and the politician in question does not get one brown penny of that money. However, it is still inappropriate that the 166 people elected to run the country and to set high standards have to be demeaned and reduced to seeking funding from their constituents to run the parliamentary process which should be centrally and properly funded.</P>
      <P>I hope the recent indications given by the Taoiseach that he will genuinely tackle this problem will be acted on and that the political parties in the House as well as the registered political parties outside it will receive the resources they require. When we compare the way we are supposed to do our business in this House in terms of research and staffing levels with our colleagues in parliaments throughout Europe, it is no wonder that it is such an unattractive career for people who should be willing to consider public service. That equation has to be tackled and resolved if we want to remove some of the difficulties faced in political life today. If we make politics a proper career with proper assistance, including research assistance, some of the difficulties we have had in the past ten or 20 years may be no more. Those comments may not be directly related to the Bill in question, but it is necessary that they are addressed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it is necessary as further insurance against people in this House operating improperly. There are bigger problems starting with the way we are elected, the way we have to run and fund our election campaigns and run our business in this House if we are elected. The big picture needs to be addressed. We are perhaps weeks, or at most months, from the next general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to speak on this Bill. When I first read it and the Minister's speech, I was struck by the raft of legislation appertaining to elected Members. Whenever this famous general election comes, whether in weeks, a few months or 12 months, and a candidate decides to stand for election for a party or independently and decides to take advice from a Minister or a Member, this candidate will be told he or she must comply with the Public Service Management Act, 1997, and take account of the Freedom of Information Act, the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act, 1997, the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, the Electoral Acts, 1997 and 1998, possibly the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act, 1999, and the Prevention of Corruption Bill, 2000. A whistleblower's protection Bill will also more than likely be introduced.</P>
      <P>There is also the Local Government Bill. The Lobbyists Registration Bill will be coming up, a number of codes of conduct will be introduced and on top of that one will have to submit a tax clearance certificate. That bank of legislation presents a fantastic encouragement to anyone who wants to become a Member of this House or enter politics at any level. Most of that legislation is recent. It is a pity things have come to this, but this is where we find ourselves.</P>
      <P>I welcome that the Minister spoke of the need to streamline this legislation, which previous speakers called for. This legislation should be consolidated and streamlined at some stage in the near future and put in such a way that the ordinary person in the street can understand it. Any eligible citizen of this State has the right to stand for election to this House and no obstacles, perceived or otherwise, should be put in his or her way. We should put all this information in as simple a manner as possible to enable a candidate who presents himself or herself for election to be presented with a book of guidelines outlining in simple terms what is required under the law and what might be required under it as it develops. That is crucial.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal that Members will only have to make one declaration of interest a year rather than two. Many of us may worry about what would happen if we were to miss the deadline. One would be castigated if one did and possibly incur a penalty.</P>
      <P>With regard to this and the other legislation I mentioned, in the event of a Member being investigated or complained about, there is a need to provide him or her with legal advice and possibly some form of administrative assistance. If one has been a Member of the House for ten years, 15 years or 20 years, one would have accumulated many documents. There is a skill in collating that information, filing it and having it to hand if one needs to use it as part of a defence or in evidence. Many colleagues spoke of the need to provide additional resources for Deputies and Senators and I hope the Minister of State has noted that.</P>

      <Col N="880" /> I had the happy duty last year of dealing with the Copyright Bill, which was one of largest and most complex Bills to come through this House. Little or no research back-up was available to Opposition Members. As the Minister of State will be aware, we get lobbied from people outside this House who put their cases, and that happened in this case. I am not an expert on copyright law, there are very few of them in this State, and I and others relied on their expertise. A number of us had to tease through the Bill line by line and it was cross-referenced, but the committee has no research back-up and the committee members do not have any administrative back-up. There were major issues at stake in regard to that Bill.</P>
    <P>We are the largest exporter of software in the world. I must compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who dealt with that Bill. The committee met on 32 occasions and we dealt with the Bill over a number of months. When we completed our consideration of it, the Bill was totally changed from the one that was initially presented by the Department. That was done in spite of our having no research back-up. If that had been available, our task would have been easier and the Bill may have been dealt with sooner and further improved.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers raised a number of issues regarding this Bill, one being that of vexatious and malicious complaints and innuendo. As public representatives we are probably more vulnerable than anyone else to innuendo and rumour. If a Member says something or does not say anything and a remark about it is partially reported in the newspapers, that can do terrible damage, as it can grow wings and develop a life of its own.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers suggested a procedure should be put in place for dealing with complaints that may be made against a Member of this House or the other House under this legislation when enacted. The Minister said we cannot stifle public debate and I agree with him, but a procedure must be in place for dealing with such complaints and under the rules of natural justice an appeals mechanism must also be put in place to enable the subject of the complaint the right to appeal against the complaint made. That is important.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made against a number of Members on all sides of the House in the recent past and they have appeared unsubstantiated in the public press and been left hanging. That can do terrible damage. If we put in place a mechanism for investigating complaints made against Members, that should be the mechanism &ndash; it should not be anywhere else. Political charges back and forth about policy and other issues are a different matter, but a mechanism should be put in place for investigating personal charges that, for instance, appear in the press. We should be able to establish where such charges originated, as they can do irreparable damage.</P>
    <P>The reporting standards in the courts were mentioned. The same reporting standards should <Col N="881" /> apply to cases in which the Standards in Public Office Commission will be involved.</P>
    <P>It is important that confidentiality is respected in such a complaints procedure. If a complaint was made against a Member to the commission, confidentiality should surround that until the commission would have issued findings as rumour and innuendo can destroy or do terrible damage to somebody in this profession.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers raised the issue of the number of Members present in the House for various debates. There are only three Members in the Chamber on this Thursday afternoon and only two Members were present earlier. That adds to public cynicism about the Dáil and what we do here. I do not know what the answer is, but proposals are before Government to reform how we do our business and they need to be acted on.</P>
    <P>I did not read of any provision in the Bill for checking declarations of interest. If a Member or a judge makes a declaration of interest, is that checked? If a Member said he was a director of a number of companies, is that checked or audited? I do not think it is. It might be useful to investigate the possibility of randomly checking them to ensure everyone is telling the truth and not hiding anything. I am not sure who should be responsible for that, but it should be done.</P>
    <P>The requirement to make declarations of interests stems from the interaction between politics and business, which we need to separate. Picking up on what my colleague, Deputy Bradford, said, it goes back to the notion of how politics is funded. There is no doubt if someone donates more than £50 or £100 to a Member of this House, that Member will probably be more sympathetic to the donor than to the person who did not give money and, the larger the sum of money, the more sympathy. That is human nature.</P>
    <P>When our party leader took over, the first thing he said was that he would get rid of corporate donations. It would solve many problems if there were no corporate donations to political parties. I call on the Government parties to take on board that aspect which might eliminate the need for much of this legislation. At the end of the day, we are all answerable to the law of the land. If people want to take money under the table, so to speak, they will take it no matter what happens. There will always be corruption.</P>
    <P>There is a perception that business and politics are too closely allied. The only way to put an end to that perception is to take the bull by the horns and eliminate large corporate donations. The size of donations should be limited. My colleagues spoke about church gate collections, with which I have a problem. This is not how political parties should collect money in this day and age because it gives a very bad image. They should be funded from the Exchequer. There is plenty money available for this. It would free up Members' energies to get down to what we should do, that is, legislate in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> Resources to committees should be increased. Due to lack of resources, the Oireachtas Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport finds it very difficult to hold meetings with regard to huge issues in the area of public enterprise. It is tied up with the investigation of the sub-committee. The other committees are also stymied in their work as the resources are not available. Just because two committees are carrying out investigative work outside their normal work, everything else must stop. This leads one to ask if the other work of the committees is necessary. Can it be dispensed with just like that? I call on the Government to ensure that committees are properly resourced, which is very important.</P>
    <P>Anonymous complaints were mentioned during the course of the debate, and this issue which must be borne in mind. I welcome the mechanism whereby an inquiry officer will do the initial groundwork up to a certain point, but we should not dismiss anonymous complaints. Confidentiality is very important, particularly with regard to anonymous complaints and they should be investigated initially because people might be genuinely afraid to put their names to something.</P>
    <P>When up and running properly, the commission should eliminate the need for further tribunals and such investigations, including investigations with which committees of this House might deal, which would be a good thing. I am not decrying the work of the tribunals, which are important, necessary and doing a good job. However, the commission, by virtue of its very existence, would deter people from getting involved in the alleged activities which are being investigated currently by the tribunals. It would probably be able to do a great deal of the investigative work at a lower level than the tribunals, even though it will have the same power as the tribunals.</P>
    <P>Section 14 needs to be looked at again. It reads, &ldquo;. . . a person who gives evidence before a Committee or the Commission . . . . shall not be entitled to refuse to answer any question . . . on the ground that his or her answer or the document might incriminate him or her.&rdquo;  When replying, I would like the Minister of State to clarify what this section means. It works both ways. If a person can or cannot answer questions before the committee, how would that influence something that might or might not happen in the future?</P>
    <P>Hardly a week goes by that we do not set up an authority. The much maligned National Roads Authority has been mentioned here from time to time. If I ask a question in this House on the issue, I receive a reply from the Ceann Comhairle's office stating that the Minister is not responsible to the Dáil in regard to that issue, therefore I cannot get a reply. We set up more and more of these authorities, including the railway procurement authority which will be set up shortly. The list goes on and on. We should enact legislation making these authorities answerable through parliamentary question in the Dáil. If a <Col N="883" /> Member puts down a question to a Minister seeking information pertaining to these State authorities, that information should be provided. We should differentiate between, on the one hand, the Minister being responsible for these authorities and interfering in their work and, on the other, the Minister giving information on the floor of this House about what the authorities are doing. That is important because it means this Chamber is handing over a great deal of power to these authorities, and they must be accountable. I am aware they are accountable to committees of the House but it would be better if they were accountable to this Chamber.</P>
    <P>Members were elected to govern the people and we live in a liberal democracy. We have a limited government, so to speak. The Government's job is to protect the citizens from the rulers, which is what our democracy is about. While capitalism is an integral part of the liberal democratic mix, we must separate it and make sure that the checks and balances exist. For that reason I welcome the Bill. I would like a consolidated framework of legislation in this area and a simplified booklet for any prospective candidates so that they will know what is required of them if they stand for election. Anyone in the State should be able to obtain such a booklet prior to an election. I believe we are moving from government to governance. Legislation is being passed in Europe and we are setting up local government structures, some of which are not elected, therefore we need to be careful. This debate will probably help the development of politics in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Bill. As a new Member of this House, I find it demoralising and humiliating that we have spent so much of the time of this House hassling between ourselves as Members, and between Government and Opposition just to prove against one another the doings of various Members elected to do a job. The issue being raised by the public now is how certain Members of these Houses have behaved in public office over the years.</P>
      <P>On one of my first days here I saw former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, literally on the verge of tears. Not knowing the background I felt that somebody should come to his assistance because of the way in which he delivered what I believed, mistakenly I admit now, was the real truth about some of the activities he was involved in down the years. Other revelations were made since about other Members and Ministers. It makes no difference whether the revelations are about Government or Opposition as they reflect on all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been out in support of by-election candidates and I have found, whether in Dublin, Tipperary or Limerick, the attitude that politicians are all the same. That is a tragedy for all of us because we have failed miserably to show the <Col N="884" /> public and the media that we are not all the same. The actions of those few over the years, because of greed, power or some other motivation, have brought these Houses into disrepute in the minds of our people and have made us the laughing stock of people outside who will avail of the opportunity to castigate us for our ways.</P>
    <P>We hear on the radio and in the media that our young people have no confidence in us and that the electorate is apathetic. We are facing into that situation next week with the referendum. The response of the public will be used by certain sections of the media who want to put a spin on it. They will say that now we have our answer and a poor turn out will be seen as a rebuff because they think we, as legislators, look after our own selfish interests. That is a wrong assessment and it is wrong for media elements to portray that as the reality.</P>
    <P>As a former teacher I have visited many schools in my own constituency over the years. Children from 12 to 18 years, some of whom have visited the House, have indicated to me that they have confidence in the system and they respect the work, effort and endeavours of most of the Members. I believe that. When we see opinion polls in the media I am very sceptical and I take them with a pinch of salt. Opinion poll results are the results required initially and evolve from the questions asked. If anybody asks a particular question in an opinion poll the answer required is generally the one they get because that is the way polls are arranged. It is deplorably wrong that people in the media should conduct opinion polls with such deliberate intentions. Headlines and sound bytes are what count to them and they are what sell papers and get television coverage.</P>
    <P>We ourselves are to blame for much of what has happened because we, and Government in particular, have spin doctors on whom we rely. They are doing things they should not be doing. They focus on individuals here and their legitimate and upright actions and put a spin on it to capture media headlines. I find that particularly difficult to accept in our present climate. I welcome this legislation if it streamlines all the legislation on the Statute Book and attempts to put the onus on the Members of the Houses and on the commission that will be established. I welcome particularly the personnel proposed to be involved in this, the Clerk of the Dáil, the Clerk of the Seanad, the Ombudsman and the Comptroller and Auditor General. I would have the utmost confidence in them to do the job they will be given under this legislation and I hope that their work will eliminate the necessity to have so many inquiries and tribunals at a cost to the State.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister could provide me with information on the cost of inquiries from the beef tribunal right down to the present. How much have these inquiries cost the taxpayer? We are still not at the end of them and do not know when they will end. If any legislation we now put in place eliminates the necessity for <Col N="885" /> such tribunals and inquiries to be such an ongoing feature of public life it will be very welcome.</P>
    <P>When talking about streamlining this legislation we touch on areas of the local government Bill. I welcome that because as a member of a local authority I have difficulty with the ethics in certain situations that members find themselves in. Members of these authorities give of their time and are elected by their local electorate. The vast majority seek to be part of public life in order to give genuine service to their electorate. I have difficulty with local authority members whose everyday professional interests may conflict with their membership of the authority. We know about some cases of this.</P>
    <P>Planning matters seem to be the centre of most criticism. Planners and architects draw up plans for companies or individuals and submit them to local authorities for adjudication. I question professionals making requests to authorities for decisions on something in which they are directly interested. It is impossible to ban auctioneers, architects or planners from becoming members of a local authority, but such people have questions to answer. I know that corrupt people are in a minority and long may it remain so, but the fact that there may be one person whose private professional work benefits from their membership of a local authority or this House means this legislation is timely. I hope it means such people can be readily and easily identified and will have to face the consequences of their actions.</P>
    <P>Many Members have mentioned the funding of political parties and the relevance of the matter is foremost in our minds. We have not been allowed to forget the topic for a single day during the lifetime of the Government as it has been directly or indirectly brought to our attention. It is important that we face up to the fact that if we want people to enter public life we cannot make it impossible for them to comply with the raft of legislation. New measures that have been introduced encroach on the personal and private lives of public representatives. Somebody has to draw the line as it will be a sad day if this legislation means those with spouses or families become targets due to their membership of an elected body.</P>
    <P>All too often, the media focuses on aspects of the personal lives of representatives and consequently severe pressure is brought to bear on their families. We have to stop this unnecessary and unjustified intrusion. Parties have to be funded, but it must be done openly and transparently if we are to retain the trust of the public. It is a difficult challenge, given the costs of the rat race of modern electioneering, where everyone wants to be the best and come first. Advertisements in local media and posters have to be paid for, which puts the onus on individuals or on party structures.</P>
    <P>There will be three referenda next Thursday, but as one drives around the country one notices the lack of posters and wonders about the quality of the campaign. If posters appear calling on us to vote in favour of or against the amendments, <Col N="886" /> the reaction of the public will be to ask how the posters were funded. This Government has failed to alert the electorate of the necessity of voting. I do not know how the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, attracts voters, but generally the Government is responsible for educating the public. It is necessary that people vote how they want, but the Government's efforts and endeavours to convince the public of the importance of these referenda have failed. There is only a week to go and I am sure it will spent in South Tipperary.</P>
    <P>The public knows that the Government has failed, as it has waited for guidance. To say that booklets have been sent to every household is not an adequate response, as it is not what the Government should be doing if it is serious about the Nice treaty. The Government should campaign and explain as it does in every other election, but it has failed to do so on the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's documents that are delivered through letterboxes are mixed up with junk mail such as flyers from shops advertising bargains.</P>

      <P>The information leaflets are thrown in bins by voters and the Nice treaty may go with it, which is unfortunate. The apathy that exists is more serious than the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, thinks it is. The Government has failed to respond to the genuine needs of voters by explaining the treaty and the importance of voting.</P>
      <P>Returning to conflicts of interest, I note that a commission will be set up and that matters deemed sufficiently serious by an investigator will be passed on to a commissioner. There should be a sole commission to decide whether or not to take action, as deemed necessary. This Bill allows for serious steps to be taken following the assessment of amounts up to £10,000, but I do not know what will happen below that figure. It will be difficult to assess the £10,000 limit, so provision should have been made to allow the commission to decide whether an elected representative has violated the trust and confidence of the people that elected him. The only way to deal with such people is to remove them from public life and ban them from re-entering it. Four former members of Fianna Fáil have become independents during this Dáil. They act and behave without limitation as Members of this House, which is sad. The public is aware of this regrettable matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this legislation. Having dealt with this subject in various shapes and forms over the past ten years, it is interesting that we are again dis<Col N="887" /> cussing it. The time has come to set out clearly in black and white the parameters within which those seeking election to public office or being appointed to public office must keep in order to eliminate ambiguity and the possibility of unwitting transgressions. This could happen where a person believes he or she is in order and it transpires to be otherwise because, perhaps, shares which he or she owned were worthless at the beginning of the year and not worthy of a declaration but increased in value and thus became worthy of a declaration. In those circumstances a person could end up in an embarrassing situation. That is an extreme example, but it illustrates the need for regulations.</P>
      <P>Let us go back to the fundamentals. Murder, for example, is banned by law and there are strict regulations relating to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>What are they?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not give my colleague any encouragement in regard to that. There are strict rules regarding the taking of life, the most stringent of all, including life imprisonment and previously death, but some people still ignore the rules and murders still take place. In the United States where the ultimate penalty still exists in many states, murder is still regularly committed. My point is that no amount of regulation will stop people who wish to disobey the rules and operate outside the parameters laid down. That has always been so, and there is no point deluding ourselves that we can solve that problem with a massive clean-up or that future generations will be beholden to us for this legislation.</P>
      <P>During the debate within the various political parties on the original ethics in public office legislation, I distinctly remember being told the extent to which the regulations would apply and that it would be relatively easy to comply with them, that there would be no unfair reflection on an individual's performance in the event that he or she did not technically comply, and that it would not adversely affect the numbers of people entering public life. Unfortunately that is not how things turned out. Slowly and inexorably a point is being reached where it is virtually impossible to qualify to stand for public office. That is very peculiar because not everybody who decides to stand for public office does so in order to pursue a career in crime. I am sure everybody believes they comply with every conceivable regulation, but when they are held up to the scrutiny of others it is a horse of a different colour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the commission. I do not know whether, if I were a member of such commission, I would be competent to judge others, notwithstanding the regulations. If somebody commits murder, for example, he or she should pay the price. If somebody knowingly breaches regulations, they should pay the price. However, there are serious glitches. I intend no disrespect to the Clerk of the Dáil, to the <Col N="888" /> Ombudsman or to anybody else, but who will judge those who judge? They may have a particular vision of what the job is about. I may or may not be correct in the view that ultimately anybody who is guilty of misconduct, who has disregarded the regulations and has brought the House into disrepute &ndash; and that is a separate issue &ndash; deserves to be dealt with by the courts. Unless we put that in legislation we are wasting our time.</P>
    <P>The proposed restrictions are deemed to be the answer at this point, but the danger of setting up a body to police another body is that it makes it appear to be less than in conformity with the regulations. That, unfortunately, is how the Houses of Parliament are perceived, and I reject that perception. I believe that 99% of people who enter public life do so for the best of reasons and in the hope of making a contribution. There is no doubt that some fall by the wayside, and one should never attempt to make excuses for them. However, regulations and guidelines should be set down in black and white beforehand.</P>
    <P>The possibility of speculation about whether somebody who has transgressed should resign should be eliminated because that is what damages the House in the eyes of the public. We should come down on one side or the other. If there is a serious breach of regulations, action should follow. That would eliminate the need for speculation or for people to write articles in the papers that set out to judge us when we have not had the opportunity of judging them.</P>
    <P>This House has over the years had mixed fortunes in terms of the public perception of what goes on. Civil war politics prevailed for the first 30 or 40 years after the foundation of the State. It was alleged to be a factor in stunting the development of the State. During the next phase, outrageous public spending was an issue that engaged the public mind. That outrageous public spending resulted in a budgetary situation that made the country ungovernable. Everybody looked for somebody to blame, and they blamed politicians. Nobody thought about asking the general public at that stage about its role. It was the public who voted for the policies that had that result. I do not want to make a political point, but I always use the 1977 election campaign in defence of Fianna Fáil. It is not fair to blame Fianna Fáil, although it is true they held out a dozen carrots to the public involving issues they said were good for us, good for them and good for the country. I am sure the Chair remembers those carrots as well as I do. Things like the abolition of rates outstripped the policies of the Government of the day by a long shot &ndash; the Government of the day had decided to offer assistance towards rates. The incoming Administration decided not only to abolish rates altogether but to abolish tax on cars. It was amazing. There were a number of other promises. The general public went to the ballot box and voted in favour of those proposals. What happened afterwards was a disgrace. It took the guts of 20 years to shake off its effects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="889" /> It is fine for those outside the House to claim they have no responsibility in these matters but they have. They have the ultimate power &ndash; their vote. The electorate decides, in the final analysis, not only the calibre of the people they want to represent them but the name and nature of each of their representatives in the House of Parliament. When all that is taken into consideration, it is clear that Members of the House have a vested interest in giving the best possible account of themselves. We also have a right to resent criticism when it is unfair.</P>
    <P>We are now in the PC or politically correct era. Other speakers have referred to this. It has affected the churches, the teaching profession, An Garda Síochána and various people in State and semi-State bodies. The politically correct era is a new and interesting one. Its judgments can be harsh but its preliminary judgments can be even harsher. There is, therefore, a necessity to ensure that in all such cases justice is done. Justice must be done and the law must be complied with but it is equally true that natural justice must prevail. Due process must be followed. If it is not followed, there will inevitably be situations in the future where the guilty may go free and the innocent may find themselves facing various strictures.</P>
    <P>Conflicts of interest are becoming increasingly difficult to police. This is particularly so in the case of those appointed to public office and ministerial posts. It must be difficult to police because if the person was previously involved in a business and divested themselves of the responsibilities of that business, how can one be certain that the person does not have an ongoing interest? Let us ask ourselves an honest question. If one has spent one's life as a director of a company or in some other capacity and then become a Minister, is it not natural that one will inquire about the company afterwards? However, if it should happen that the company falls to be considered for a contract or a particular devolved responsibility, I presume the individual concerned is expected in all cases to recognise that a conflict could arise.</P>
    <P>The problem is that it is not for the individual to judge whether a conflict arises; it will be judged by somebody else, with the benefit of hindsight. Hindsight is an extremely exact science but, as we all know, there is no such thing. All decisions are made without the benefit of hindsight. A person's judgment, therefore, must be correct and stand the test of hindsight. I am always amazed when people say &ldquo;With the benefit of hindsight, I believe&rdquo; such and such. That sounds fine but it is rubbish. There is no such thing as having the benefit of hindsight when one is making a decision.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the course of the next few years, following implementation of this legislation, we will see on the part of those participating in public life a recognition of the fact that certain procedures must be complied with, that they must act within the guidelines and that there are no exceptions. We must also accept that in the event <Col N="890" /> of a breach occurring, there is little use talking about it. The procedures must fall into place and whatever should happen, must happen. It is sad but that is the way it is. There can be no getting around it.</P>
    <P>By the same token, the fact that a number of people in public life are deemed not to have been compliant with the regulations does not mean everybody is guilty. If a member of a profession is found to be in breach of ethics, rules or guidelines, that does not mean that every member of that profession is guilty. That is important. There are people outside this House, fuelled by the speculation that is part of the era in which we live, who have come to the conclusion that everybody in this House is a crook or a potential crook. We must be extremely careful because we could do irreparable damage if we allow ourselves to be corralled under that category. We could also do irreparable damage to the institutions of State.</P>
    <P>It might well be fun when public representatives are involved but it will be another group tomorrow and another group the next day and other groups will follow. That is not an attempt to take away from the fact that we must have the highest possible standards. It is simply a recognition of reality. Some time ago I gave a talk to a group of sixth years in a school in my constituency. There was an interesting line of questions. There was a clear impression among the sixth years that if all politicians were not crooks, they were either on the road to it or had it in their sights. That is sad. They were shocked when I turned the question round to them and asked if they believed all students were crooks or that all sixth years were potentially negligent in complying with school regulations or that all teachers had the same problem.</P>
    <P>It is only when that happens that members of the general public begin to recognise that life is full of knots and bends in the road, that it is not as smooth as they might think. I remember having a discussion with a guy in a pub about the merits and demerits of people in public office and public life. He suggested that guidelines, like the guidelines in this Bill, should be laid down so the public would know these people were compliant with them when they sought public office. How would anybody know that the person had been compliant in the first place? How would the person make a confession beforehand and inform the public that they had been compliant with the guidelines? I asked the guy if he would comply. &ldquo;Absolutely&rdquo;, he said.</P>

He spoke honestly and truthfully. He honestly and sincerely said what he thought. I told him I was delighted to meet him but I reminded him: &ldquo;That is your judgment of <Col N="891" /> you. You should try to find out what other people's judgment of you might be&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>My colleague and friend, Deputy Durkan, is getting more philosophical about human nature and the problems connected with it as he grows older. Like most Members of this House, I feel a sense of sadness about the revelations which have appeared in recent years. If I had been asked my opinion on it 15 years ago, I would have felt it was impossible but sadly the realities of what has happened are staring us in the face. The body politic has been seriously weakened as a result of the loss of trust in politicians felt by the people of Ireland who generalise in that regard.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Durkan said, in every walk of life some people fall by the wayside. That is inevitable but unfortunately the public generalise as they did in the case of the Catholic Church where, I understand, there are 27 priests currently serving a jail sentence in the Curragh for sexual crimes. That, along with the revelations about Bishop Éamon Casey, has done more damage to the Catholic Church than Oliver Cromwell did.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the recent revelations about political impropriety have done the same to the world of politics. We need to do something positive to lift the profile of politics in Irish life because the young people are getting more cynical by the week. Some time ago I spoke to a group of 16 year old students in a college in Dundalk and I was shocked at their political ignorance. These were girls who in two years would perhaps be going to universities in different parts of Ireland. Politically they were as ignorant as they could be. Only four out of 16 knew who were the four Deputies for County Louth, two knew who was the county manager, and very few could differentiate between the urban council and the county council.</P>

      <P>I just feel sad at the ignorance in this country about why politics are necessary. So many people are not tuned in and do not have a clue why politics are necessary. Many see politics as being there to penalise them. They do not understand it, and that is the reality. How can people who, in their tens of thousands, watch fantasy soaps such as &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo;, &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo; relate to political manifestos. They just cannot do so. They are living in a fog. That is part of the problem &ndash; they fail to <Col N="892" /> appreciate why politics are necessary and what politics have done for this country.</P>
      <P>We in the political system, even those of us on the backbenches, can take pride in what we have created in this country. We are only 80 years masters of our own destiny and today we have a country which is on a par with America. We have given the citizens of Ireland an economic living which nobody could have envisaged 20, 30 or 40 years ago. That did not happen overnight. It had to be created by progressive and forward thinking by all parties which constitute the political system.</P>
      <P>One of the main bugbears which we in the political world must face is the cynical attitude of the gents who are not in the Press Gallery today. I do not know whether some of them would be in the bar. I am referring to the media. These cynics &ndash; I must confess that for a short period of my life I was in their midst &ndash; are under-valuing politics on a continuous basis and denigrating the efforts of the political system. No matter who is in power, they want to pull the system down. They want to pander to the ignorant beliefs of the lesser educated people in our midst. They want to suggest that there is malpractice everywhere. I feel a deep regret that the media, who constitute educated people with a responsible stake in the country, should be so cynical about casting aspersions on the political world. They should be encouraging the people of Ireland to appreciate what has been created in this country and they should encourage people to have more respect for the political system, but they are not going to change because that is what sells newspapers. I am glad to see my friend, John Drennan, emerging, perhaps from the cupboard not the bar.</P>
      <P>The media are not above reproach and I have no difficulty standing over what I have said. Notwithstanding that, there is a deep concern out there about what has been revealed in Irish life and I support this commission which will look at various aspects of people's suitability. As Deputy Durkan alluded to, I do not know how they will evaluate it, but I do feel that if there is a serious question over any political figure, it is not a matter for a commission or, indeed, tribunals but for the Garda fraud squad. While the recent tribunals, the proceedings of which seem to go on forever, have been worthwhile because they have opened a window in Irish life and, indeed, a cesspool, the existence of which, as I said earlier, 15 years ago I would have refused to accept, I must ask what will come ultimately from all of these tribunals? Will anybody be held responsible? Will anybody be charged? I doubt it because this is an Irish solution to an Irish problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every would be candidate should be screened by his party and if there is any suggestion of impropriety in his or her background, the person should not be nominated, whether he or she is a football star, a hurling or camogie star or an ordinary person. Political parties should be conscious of the image they are trying to portray to the Irish public, and the first step should be taken by the <Col N="893" /> political parties and, after that, there should be an independent body to assess them. Every suggestion of impropriety should be examined and if there is a case to be answered, it should be answered in a court of law.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make about standards in public life is that we must accept and acknowledge that Members amongst us have transgressed. The most deplorable thing I can imagine is that a senior politician or any politician would take a bribe. To accept a bribe on the scale of what we are being told is surely anathema to the people of this country. It turns me off and disillusions me about politics notwithstanding that I believe the Irish political system has provided the Irish nation with a tremendous standard of living which no one thought possible 40 years ago. The sins revealed are crying out to be redressed. Political parties should not be ambivalent to those members of their party who have fallen by the wayside. The political system is better off without them.</P>
    <P>While we can be proud of what we have created over the past 80 years, the people have, sadly, relegated us to the level of conmen. The political system is viewed as a confidence trick. We must redress that view. We can only do so by introducing transparency. Perhaps along with that transparency, we might have a little more responsibility from the press.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on what I regard as one of the more important Bills currently before this House. It is part of a family of legislation which addresses one of the most difficult things for Members of this House to address, the restoration of public confidence in the way we do public business. That confidence has been sorely damaged by the ongoing out-pouring of revelations in recent years.</P>
      <P>The genesis of this Bill is the report of the tribunal of inquiry into the Dunnes Stores payments, better known as the McCracken report. We were all shocked by that report. Some would say this report goes back to the doings of a distinguished businessman in a hotel in Florida. That deed, over a particular holiday break, set in train a process the extent of which few could have envisaged. The Dunnes Stores payments process, the first serious tribunal of inquiry into potential corruption to discover where senior politicians in this land were kept people, has had an ongoing effect. It has been the back-drop in front of which all of us have carried on public business for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of my party, I handled the passing of the terms of reference of the Moriarty Tribunal through this House. I remember, during the course of that debate, seeking to extend the terms of reference to include Ansbacher payments which had come to light at that time. That proposal, made on 11 September 1997, was voted down by the current Administration. It gave no coherent reason Ansbacher payments should not be encompassed within the terms of reference of <Col N="894" /> the new tribunal then being established. We were told, behind the scenes, by Deputy McCreevy who took the debate on behalf of the Government, that there was a fear of a flight of capital out of the country if the Ansbacher accounts were included in the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal. No person from the Government or Central Bank was willing to back-up this exaggerated and totally over-blown claim. Like so many other things, it is probably an issue which the Government would prefer to pretend did not exist.</P>
    <P>We need to get things right. The previous Administration, in which I had the honour to serve as Cabinet Minister, began that process. My party fought the 1992 election on two fundamental bases: ethics in Government and justice in the economy. We were lambasted and pilloried on foot of the first commitment we made regarding ethics &ndash; many people thought we were setting ourselves up as great paragons of virtue, which we have not done or have no intention of doing because there is no monopoly of wisdom or virtue in this regard on any side of the House. We need to set standards which we can all try to live up to.</P>
    <P>We put through both Houses, with huge difficulties, three Bills; the Ethics in Public Office Act, taken through by my colleague Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald who received enormous personal vilification when doing so. There was huge resistance to it; the Freedom of Information Act, one of the most important, open, democratising Bills enacted in modern times in this State which is impacting on all public administration and bringing the light of public scrutiny into crevices which are not used to having that light shone on them and we are often not comfortable with it. I hope &ndash; I say this as an aside &ndash; that the media will make more fruitful use of that legislation. It is not the major coup of the Freedom of Information Act to find out the travel expenses of any Member of this House. There are more relevant things about which investigative journalists should ensure accountability through that system. I had the privilege of bringing through this House the third Bill enacted by the previous Administration, the Electoral Act which set disclosure limits for contributions to individual Members of this House or to political parties and for the first time set caps on electoral spending. That was an extremely complex Bill to draft; it took me some time. It was fought tooth and nail by the parties then in Opposition. My clearest memory is of the then spokesperson of the Progressive Democrats, now the Attorney General &ndash; I hope his legal advice has improved &ndash; telling me the Electoral Act was unconstitutional, so bad it could not be amended and so he satisfied himself fighting it line by line. Not only has that legislation stood the test of time but I was interested to read recently on the Fianna Fáil website &ndash; I occasionally log into it to find out what they have to say &ndash; that the current Administration is claiming it as legislation enacted by it. Legislation which was so bad and incapable of being amended is now <Col N="895" /> claimed as its creation. That is a neat trick if one could get away with it. It is part of the bedrock of the changing face of public administration at local and national level. We have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has published a number of new Bills in recent years. We introduced legislation to ban corporate funding for politics. One of the most important, critical issues with which we in this House and this country must finally come to terms is how politics and public affairs are to be funded. We need to resolve that issue. There is enormous public antipathy to the interface of business and politics which is destroying confidence in our political systems and eroding our democracy.</P>
    <P>The introduction of that legislation, deemed to have been passed some time ago, will not ever be allowed pass through Committee Stage. I recently attended a committee with other Labour colleagues in support of our spokesperson on the environment, Deputy Gilmore, to see if the Government would allow our legislation to ban corporate donations to advance but that was not allowed to happen. We were promised that the Government would produce its own amendments to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill in order to deal with the matter. As the leader of the Labour Party said this morning, it is now dawning on all of us that the Taoiseach's commitments in this regard are hollow and meaningless. More than 70 amendments to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill currently before the Seanad were published yesterday by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, yet there was no mention in any of them of the limits to be set for corporate contributions to politics. We do not know the Government's thinking despite promise after promise, month after month, and can only come to the conclusion that it is determined to fight the next general election on the basis of existing law and that it finds it impossible to break the connection between politics and business and let go of its corporate funders. I remain to be convinced but perhaps the Minister of State will be able to give us a fixed date on behalf of the Administration by which this important promise will be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>We introduced whistleblower legislation to allow those working in public affairs at some level to blow the whistle and call in the legal authorities to investigate a scam or an abuse without fear of damage or harm to themselves. The Government did not have the guts to vote it down and sought instead to kill it in committee where it has languished for months on end. The Taoiseach repeatedly promised that such legislation would be part of the Government's comprehensive regime of legislation. We still await its proposals.</P>
    <P>The Register of Lobbyists Bill was another brought forward by our Seanad colleagues and, again, was not allowed passage by the Administration. As spokesperson on justice, I produced an anti-corruption Bill. The Government pro<Col N="896" /> duced its own Bill a year ago which was finally allowed to proceed to Committee Stage yesterday. I hope it will proceed to enactment because it deals with very important issues. One of the most difficult matters for the public to understand is that seemingly corruption is not recognised, even when there is a clear discernment of a wad of money being given to somebody in authority and that person doing something advantageous for the donor. Under the old 1906 Corruption Act there was a change in the law from the older Victorian statute of the 1890s whereby in cases where a contract was involved, money was donated to the giver of the contract and the donor subsequently won the contract, there was a presumption of corruption. It is now hoped the presumption of corruption will be extended to other areas such as the giving of licences and other valuable commodities by public administrators, including grants of zoning of land, where a substantial contribution is paid to the person who does the favour or the person who decides on a licence.</P>
    <P>We are moving slowly to put in place a comprehensive framework of legislative measures in which the Bill is an important milestone. What it seeks to do is update and consolidate the Ethics in Public Office Act of 1995. It strengthens and changes the role of the commission which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with another issue which is extremely important in the whole process of building confidence in public administration and public life. The House is often allowed to be a cipher, a rubber stamp for the Executive. Nominally we have a parliamentary democracy whereby the will of the people is reflected in the membership of the House which makes laws, determines the tax base and all the other matters that govern the life of the nation. Often the people who make the least impact are the Members of the House. Lobby groups, the social partners, IBEC, the Congress of Trades Unions, the farmers' organisations all have a greater impact in shaping our social norms, the tax base, the standards of our health and education services than non-Executive Members of the House. It is time for us to reclaim a parliamentary role. I say this very strongly in the context of the whole debate on the Nice Treaty.</P>
    <P>When I served in office I had the privilege of being a member of the Council of Ministers but was not scrutinised on the positions I took as a representative of Ireland at the Council. That level of parliamentary scrutiny was not provided for. In Denmark, for instance, Ministers as a matter of routine receive instructions from Parliament as to what the position of the country should be on important issues. When people talk about the democratic deficit at the heart of Europe the democratic deficit is not in Brussels but here in these Houses because we have not asserted ourselves. The process of reasserting the primacy of parliament and the role of parliamentarians must begin by fulfilling the advice given <Col N="897" /> in the final report on the DIRT inquiry that a parliamentary commission be established.</P>
    <P>We need independence from the Department of Finance in our affairs. I say this with some pleasure in the presence of officials from and the Minister of State at that Department. It is wrong that committees of the House which want to engage in public work and public scrutiny are vetted by civil servants who determine the extent of the scope of the inquiry. They decide whether resources are made available to employ researchers and on the level of backup members may have. Members have pitiful backup resources compared to modern European parliaments. Those of us who try to be Front Bench spokespersons in opposition have an impossible job. We must scrutinise and respond to complicated legislation and table meaningful amendments. This is an enormous job of work which is becoming farcical.</P>
    <P>I mentioned yesterday on Committee Stage of the corruption Bill that the Minister's amendments were only published in the morning. During the course of the debate the Minister gleefully informed us that they were complicated and had taken months to negotiate with the Attorney General but we were supposed not only to digest them but also to seek to amend them in a matter of hours with no backup available. This is because there is a mindset in the Executive, particularly in some Departments, that we are really here to rubber-stamp its decisions, not to engage in meaningful scrutiny of public administration. We have allowed this to happen, that perception to become a reality, because we have not demanded our rights.</P>
    <P>A parliamentary commission is required. We also need to have an independent Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas, negotiated by the Leader of the House, on the same basis as, for example, any individual Minister negotiates with the Department of Finance in terms of the Vote for their Department. It is ludicrous that there is no advocate for the Houses of the Oireachtas, in terms of the Oireachtas Vote, to explain our demands, what an effective parliament must do and that we will not settle for less. That affects all Members because membership of the Executive is a temporary position. There is a cross-flow at every election across the House. The primacy of the decision-making of the House is something in which we all have a vested interest, not just those who. for whatever reason, are temporarily or permanently on this side. It is a point of principle for every Member.</P>
    <P>The ability of committees of the House to carry on investigations is new. We are testing the waters in that regard.</P>

It is important to restate the primacy of the House, and that meaningful support, backup and resources are provided so that the House can be a real investigator and watchdog on behalf of the public. That whole process paralleled with the array of legislation to which I have referred together with the Bill before the House will give back confidence to the Irish people in our ability to conduct their affairs fairly and without favour or bias and certainly without any hint or suggestion of corruption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill and one which I and my party support. Regrettably legislation of this nature is necessary. In the past this type of legislation would not have been necessary. Many years ago I recall speaking to the late Michael McInerney, political correspondent of <i>The Irish Times,</i> and the late Ned Murphy, political editor of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> who wrote also for the <i>Irish Independent.</i> We discussed the relationship of members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, civil servants and the discharge of duties. One of the points discussed was instructions given by a Minister to a civil servant. The civil servant felt duty bound to carry out the instruction of his Minister. In the event of him being of the opinion that there was something wrong with the instruction, after he had carried it out, he would report to the Taoiseach of the day that he was unhappy with the instruction he had been obliged to carry out. That was at a time when there was trust and confidence in the Taoiseach of the day. I speak of the late 1960s. Sadly, the whole scenario changed in that the Fianna Fáil Party allowed somebody who was unfit to become Taoiseach and those who associated with him were unfit to be members of a Government or of the House. It changed the face and character of politics and it has caused damage that will last for many a long day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the heave against Charles Haughey, the then leader of the Opposition, an instruction was given by a Mr. Moore of the PMPA to Deputy David Andrews to do the right thing. At the time Deputy Andrews had the courage to stand by his convictions. As it transpired he lost business because he did not do as he was told. Deputy Andrews was a Member and also a barrister and had the financial capacity to withstand that type of instruction. How many others in Ireland were told to do the right thing and support the then Leader of Fianna Fáil? It worries me because I am certain that a considerable num<Col N="899" /> ber of people were intimidated into supporting the then leadership of Fianna Fáil. Regrettably, the other members of the party did not have the courage to stand up to him. In fact, I saw the late Deputy Jim Gibbons being struck in the courtyard of the House. It was a sad and appalling incident. As far as I can recollect he did not return to the House afterwards. A political party allowed that to happen.</P>
    <P>The standards in public office at that time were so low and so dangerous that as a country we were lucky to survive. This is what has given rise to this necessary legislation. We have found ourselves in a situation where legislation had to be enacted requiring public representatives, TDs and Senators and some senior civil servants to make disclosures of personal possessions, property and so on. This is not conducive to entering public life, rather it can be a barrier and prevent some people from entering public life. That is regrettable. This was caused by a political party which did not have the courage to ensure it had a Taoiseach who would uphold the standards and dignity entrusted in him by the House.</P>
    <P>Political parties have lost a considerable amount of the voluntary effort and support enjoyed in the past. All political parties have difficulty in retaining and getting young people into the ranks. That is a serious matter and one that will not change in the foreseeable future. Young people are not joining political parties. Some who have had a long involvement in political parties have faded away from the political scene. That is a pity. Because of events in the past, people have become disillusioned. That is sad because in political life there is a need for people to be involved and actively supporting the various political organisations to which they have a loyalty.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem facing political parties. At present they are required to respond instantaneously to questions put to them by the press. While the press has considerable research facilities and resources at its disposal political parties are restricted as they do not have half those resources available to them.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a major <Col N="900" /> tourism marketing reassurance campaign to help counter the adverse impact of the foot and mouth crisis, is already under way in our key source markets, including the United States. The campaign, with a total budget of £10 million, has been designed by Bord Fáilte in consultation with the tourism industry. I was particularly pleased that the Government at its meeting in Killarney earlier this week gave approval for the final Exchequer contribution of £2 million towards the cost of this campaign. These actions are, of course, incremental to the 2001 budget previously approved for tourism marketing which represented the largest ever level of State funding for tourism marketing and brings the total Exchequer provision now for tourism marketing and promotion in 2001 to £67 million.</P>
      <P>The reassurance marketing campaign consists of special media advertising, trade reassurance measures and special promotional visits, including my own recent visit to the US. In the course of that visit, I undertook 30 interviews with television, radio and print media; I attended trade and media events in four cities and had three industry meetings.</P>
      <P>As regards the use of personalities to endorse the marketing campaign, I am pleased to say that, following a request from the Government, the rock band U2 are highlighting the attractions of holidaying in Ireland to fans at their US concerts and have included favourable material on their website. In addition, the movie star, Martin Sheen, who is currently starring as President Bartlet in the hit television series &ldquo;The West Wing&rdquo;, has been used in special new television and radio advertising in the US.</P>
      <P>I understand from Bord Fáilte that former President Bill Clinton's recent visit to Ireland did generate some useful publicity in the US and this, of course, is to be welcomed.</P>

        <b>:</b> With all due respect to the Minister and Martin Sheen, even with Bord Fáilte spending £10 million on marketing, the Minister must acknowledge that a golden opportunity was missed. President Clinton was the most pro-Irish US President since President Kennedy. His vision and determination were singularly responsible for silencing the IRA guns in the North and ending the killing. His impact would have been instant and enormous and he could have dispelled the myth that foot and mouth disease is an animal rather than a human condition. He could have shown that the crisis was not widespread but was isolated to one outbreak in County Louth. Why did the Minister or someone in Bord Fáilte not have the vision to see that President Clinton was available to be a willing accomplice to the Irish cause as he always has been? He could have done considerably more for the country than we will get out of the £10 million, the Minister's visit to the United States and the advertising by Martin Sheen and others. Why did the Minister not grab this opportunity?</P>

      <P>It is not intended that contracts for the designing, building, financing, operating and maintaining of facilities for Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland, other than that with the preferred bidder for the aquatic and leisure centre, will be signed in advance of the independent overview of the costs of the project. Following consideration of the consultants' report the Government will decide on the way forward.</P>
      <P>Campus and Stadium Ireland Development &ndash; CSID &ndash; the company which was established last year to oversee the planning and development of Sports Campus Ireland has already signed a contract relating to the provision of executive services and entered a commitment, leading to contracts, in relation to the architectural and environmental framework plan and other related services. The process for the appointment of project managers, currently under way, is also expected to be finalised in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, given the time frame for the legislation, it is likely that contracts may be signed in advance of the Bill being enacted. There will, of <Col N="902" /> course, be provisions for transitional arrangements in the Bill to ensure the continuity of activities initiated before its enactment.</P>

      <P>From what the Minister has said, I understand that until the independent audit has been completed no further contracts will be signed. It had been envisaged that the Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland Bill would be published mid-year. That has now been put back to the end of the year. The fact that full contractual statutory powers are not available to the company must inhibit the progress of the project. If a totally negative independent audit result comes back, will the Government review the whole project against that background?</P>

      <P>There seems to be a continual move to dampen down the magnificent scheme of Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland. I gave a commitment to the House that the heads of the Bill would be circulated before the end of May. If that is not already done, it is in the process of being done today.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, it will not hold up the process. There has been nothing other than negative comments from the other side of the House on this sports campus project. I am delighted to have the overview because all the positive aspects of the project will also be highlighted. I look forward to receiving that report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not worth responding to the Minister throwing negative darts at this side of the House. There is no substance to that. The Government has agreed to review the project, so there must be doubts within Government as to its viability. I hope a proper audit will be carried out which should include items like the add ons, as Paddy Teahon calls them. These include the cost of the land, the relocation of the laboratories of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Marine Institute. Is the Minister satisfied that an 80,000 seat stadium is appropriate for the project? Is there a national requirement for a second 80,000 seat stadium?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I do believe we need another 80,000 seat stadium. We certainly need another stadium. It has been clearly pointed out that we cannot possibly use Croke Park as a national stadium. It is impossible to play soccer, rugby and Gaelic games there so we certainly need another stadium. Soccer has no home of its own at the moment. The IRFU cannot possibly manage all its rugby games. For the match against Portugal on Saturday, we could fill a stadium for 70,000 people, if we had it, and that is only a qualifying match for the world cup. Negotiations are also in progress with Scotland with regard to the European championship in 2008. Many things are possible if we have the infrastructure, but if we do not provide that now when times are prosperous, we will never do it.</P>

      <P>The new tourism product investment scheme will be implemented by Bord Fáilte, in line with sub-measures 1 to 3 of the tourism measure within the regional operational programmes. The overall objective of the scheme is to develop the tourism product in a sustainable way that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from the highly developed areas and increases the under-performing regions' share of overseas tourism revenue.</P>
      <P>Tourism sub-measures 1 and 2 are to be co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund and their operation must, according to the Community Support Framework document (paragraph 2.5.1), for Ireland be fully compliant with the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community, all instruments adopted under it, and with Community policies and actions, including the rules on competition.</P>
      <P>Detailed guidelines for project promoters have been drafted by Bord Fáilte in consultation with my Department. They will be finalised once state aids clearance of the scheme, by the Competition Directorate of the European Commission, is secured. While this is the &ldquo;third round&rdquo; of European Regional Development Fund and Exchequer capital investment in the tourism sector, it is the first occasion on which formal state aids notification and clearance has been required for each individual measure before the scheme can be launched. Under the new state aid arrangements, Ireland changes from being a single &ldquo;A&rdquo; region to being composed of one &ldquo;A&rdquo; region &ndash; the BMW Region &ndash; with aid limits of 40%, plus 15% for small and medium enterprises, in the 2000-06 period, and five &ldquo;C&rdquo; regions &ndash; in the S&amp;E region &ndash; where, by 2004, the maximum aid limits will range from 17.5% to 20%, plus 10% for small and medium enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the time scale of developments to date, and with due regard for the European Com<Col N="904" /> mission's guide to the Community rules on state aid, my Department has contributed to the development of the regional operational programmes &ndash; approved by the European Commission last December &ndash; the programme complements, that is, the documents setting out the detailed elements at sub-measure level which are currently being finalised by the regional assemblies, who are the managing authorities for the 2000-06 period, and the detailed operational guidelines referred to earlier, which are being drawn up by Bord Fáilte for project promoters.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the tourism product investment scheme is still being examined, under the state aids rules, by DG Competition of the European Commission, to whom the scheme was formally notified as required by the relevant regulation in October 2000. A meeting at official level is scheduled for next Wednesday, 6 June, and I am hopeful that these discussions will enable the Commission to give the necessary clearances to allow for early publication and implementation of this scheme.</P>

      <P>The Minister may need to clarify what he said. I understand that the measures in question are now applicable from 2002 to 2006 rather than from 2000. Can the Minister explain why, some 18 months after the announcement of sub-measures 1, 2 and 3 in the national development plan, funding has not yet been allocated for those measures and cannot be drawn down to date? Does he agree that the development of major attractions, the special interests pursuits and the tourism environmental management programmes are of fundamental importance to the development of tourism in this country? In view of the damaging impact of the foot and mouth crisis on the tourism sector, does he agree that these three sub-measures should now be expedited and funding made available as soon as possible? When will the funding be made available and why has it taken so long? Other Departments have got approval from the EU in relation to other measures in the NDP. Why is there such a delay on the tourism measures? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. I would like to see those measures brought forward and implemented as soon as possible. There is a meeting on 6 June which may, I hope, clarify some of the matters to which the Deputy has referred. In order to get these measures up and running, particularly the large measures, developers need an adequate time frame to draw down funding and put plans in place. On the State aids issue, it is a matter for the EU to make inquiries with regard to the specific details. For example, I have been trying to have a provision included for grant aiding small family run hotels. The Commission has a period of two months within which to reply but if, in the interim, we submit additional information, or they request further details which we have to forward to them, the two months period then runs from the date of that new communi<Col N="905" /> cation. Correspondence, or perhaps red tape, can therefore delay the process. That is how it is set out in EU law, which I can read out if the Deputy wishes. I hope I have explained some of the reasons for the delay. At the meeting on 6 June, I am hopeful that we will come close to finalising the entire package.</P>

May I also ask the Minister what is the status of the agri-tourism and marine tourism budgets which are of fundamental importance to certain sectors? </P>

Also, in the last budget, we brought in a measure whereby hotels which were grant aided could not have the double capital loans arrangement. All those matters had to be discussed in great detail. I am as anxious as the Deputy to get the programme up and running. Funding for the tourism sector is partly under European Regional Development Fund funding and we have to abide by that set of regulations also.</P>

      <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, provides funding to voluntary sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national levels throughout the country towards the provision of sport and recreational facilities. Under the 2001 sport capital programme I have received 1,467 applications and these are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines for the programme. As soon as the assessment of the projects has been completed, I will be in a position to finalise the overall budget for this year's allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past three years, 1998 to 2000, this Government has allocated grants to the value of approximately £62 million to more than 1,300 projects. Compared with the three year total of £18 million in allocations by the previous Government in the period 1995 to 1997, the commitment <Col N="906" /> of this Government to the provision of funding for sport and recreation facilities nationwide is clear.</P>

      <P>In my colleague, Deputy Ryan's area, £46 million was spent on young people from the youth and facilities fund. As I pointed out to the Deputy, since we came into office, the amount of money going to sport is phenomenal. The average grant in 2000 was £52,700 compared to between £10,000 and £12,000 when the Deputy's party was in Government. Under the sports capital programme from 1998 to 2002, the number of projects funded increased by 176% from 246 to 679. The amount of money allocated to these capital programmes increased 500% and the average grant by 118%.</P>
      <P>These included major indoor facilities. We put £4.8 million into Santry stadium. We put athletic facilities in Cork, Galway, Castleisland, Navan and Ringsend. We contributed £1.3 million to the national boxing stadium and £500,000 to the national rowing centre in County Cork. In the Eircom soccer league, nine clubs got support. Shamrock Rovers were given £500,000, while Dalymount and Tolka Park got £550,000 each. Out of the 26 county grounds, 15 received support during my term in office. In 2000, the GAA received £10.82 million, soccer £5.45 million and rugby £706,000. Under this Government, £20 million went to Croke Park. We put £45 million into the swimming pool programme, to which the Deputy's Government gave £3 million a year. We financed a 50 metre national swimming pool in Limerick by £6 million and £85 million is earmarked in the national development plan.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's leader says that he would spend £0.5 billion on small facilities. We are half way there already. As I pointed out to the Deputy, it is all right to promise these things but there are not enough developers and construction people to build these facilities. Projects, which some regard as little, of £200,000 or £300,000 are a drop in the ocean compared to the type the developments developers are involved in today because the economy is such that they make millions building houses and other projects. It is difficult to get them. One can promise all one wants, but at the end of the year, I still must hand back funding. I intend to announce shortly this year's allocation of the national lottery funds. We will continue to do approximately 500 to 700 more projects this year.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on dodging the question I asked. It is a simple question and maybe he will give me a simple answer. How much money will he make available this year in the sports capital grant? Is it virtually half of what he made available last year? Is it true what he told Deputy Owen, that he will make it £19 million this year and gave £36 million last year? Is it also true that on those figures, we will be approximately £200 million short of applications nationally? There is a huge demand for our infrastructure to be upgraded. Why is he halving the amount of money of the sports capital grant? The Minister had this question in plenty of time. Why is he dodging a reply? It is a written question that was in his Department long enough. Will he reply to the question asked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I will. In responding to Deputy Owen, we worked off the Estimates, as the Deputy's colleagues can inform him. The answer to Deputy Owen of £19 million was worked out from the Estimates for last year. This has been explained. We estimated £19 million and because of all the extra applications that came in, I explained to my colleague, Deputy McCreevy, that we need more money. We increased it to £36 million. The same will happen this year. There are requests in every year for over £200 million. They exist on paper. There are some very poor applications and some counties' applications dropped this year. In previous years we gave out £10,000 and £15,000 like snuff at a wake. We gave 10% or 20% of a grant and asked the community or club to get the rest. I changed that around and now I ask them to raise a minimum of 20%. Unfortunately, many clubs have no planning permission or funding. Many wrote in willy-nilly seeking to build little Wemblies. Some of the applications do not stand up. It is easy to say that we are looking for £220 million but at least £120 million is pie in the sky because there is nothing to back it up. That is the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the implementation of national tourism marketing and promotion policies is best undertaken by a dedicated executive body working in concert with the tourism industry. Bord Fáilte serves the interests of the country well in this regard. Since I took office, visitor numbers have increased by an average growth of 8% from 5.2 million in 1997 to 6.4 mill<Col N="908" /> ion in 2000 more than twice the European average growth rate over the same period.</P>
      <P>A number of developments have taken place over the past year or so which will further refine our overall effort in tourism marketing. Tourism Ireland Limited, established under the North-South Ministerial Council, is expected to be fully operational for the 2002 season and will have responsibility for all island international tourism marketing. This development, involving enhanced North-South co-operation, will bring significant, tangible benefits to our international tourism promotion effort. The new body will work closely with Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, which will continue to have responsibility for promoting and developing tourism products and regions. The establishment last year of the tourism marketing partnership involving Bord Fáilte and the Irish tourism industry, was designed to bring about a greater level of synergy between industry and the board in international tourism marketing, planning and implementation. It is a good example of co-operation and partnership between the State sector and the private commercial arm of the tourism industry which is contributing to a more dynamic approach to promoting Ireland abroad. It is envisaged that similar partnership arrangements will operate under the aegis of Tourism Ireland Limited.</P>

      <P>I do not have the figure for the number of Bord Fáilte offices. There is a large number overseas and if the Deputy tables a question for written answer, I will get the information for her. Bord Fáilte has been a tremendous success. Deputy Higgins is correct, it is very popular to be Irish in the world today. Australia, a large continent in the Antipodes, only attracts approximately four million visitors. Although it is a long distance away, it has the huge population of Asia on its doorstep. As a small island in the north Atlantic, we attract 6.4 million visitors. Therefore Bord Fáilte must be doing something right. The figures for 1997-98 were up 10.5%. In 1998-99 they were up 7.4% and in 1999-2000, 8%. Those are phenomenal figures.</P>

I am not for redrawing the boundaries in order that a single tourism board would <Col N="910" /> be responsible for each county. The regions can be best developed under the regional tourism authorities. To have, as Deputy Naughten pointed out, five bodies marketing the Shannon is quite a number. Differentiating between counties Roscommon, Mayo and Galway would also be a problem. The rationalisation problem will continue. There is undoubtedly overlap and a lot of money is spent on flashy and glossy brochures. Recent research points out that 80% of brochures end up in the bin while other research indicates that there are enough brochures in the country to fill&mdash;</P>

      <P>I imagine with the advent of Tourism Ireland Limited that the regional tourism authorities will probably have to take on board the drawing of different boundaries, in other words, certain counties would be better off attached to other areas. This should be part of the remit of TIL. As we are taking in Northern Ireland, we will have to think about redrawing the boundaries of the regional tourism authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, 13, 14, 17, 22, 51, 54, 148, 156 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>Official CSO figures are not yet available for overseas visitor numbers and revenue earnings in 2001, nor are there any reliable figures available on the number of cancellations or bed nights lost due to the foot and mouth crisis. Bord Fáilte originally estimated a potential loss this year of 14% in the number of overseas visitors on the basis of initial assessments of the possible impact of foot and mouth restrictions on tourism, when compared to the 2000 outcome of 6.4 million, equivalent to a reduction in revenue of 13%. It will be some time before the board will be in a position to confirm those estimates and the impact on them of Ireland being able to announce that it was fully open for business well in advance of the peak season.</P>
      <P>More recent reports from the industry and through a survey commissioned by CERT suggest that while there has been an improvement in business and forward bookings in recent weeks after the lifting of the internal foot and mouth disease control measures, business could still be down this year on 2000. The CERT survey showed that the majority of establishments indicated no change in numbers employed, with operators preferring to reduce the number of hours worked by staff rather than letting them go. Bord Fáilte's projections of industry losses may well prove to be pessimistic as they do not take into account the impact of the incremental marketing activities being undertaken and the extent to which business may rebound later this year.</P>
      <P>Since the onset of the foot and mouth emergency I have taken a range of measures together with my Department and Bord Fáilte to help offset the adverse impact on the tourism industry. In the interests of time I will not go through the measures which I have stated previously. The measures proved successful and the country has now returned to normality in terms of its attraction to visitors. All the State's cultural and heritage sites have reopened and there is an open welcome to visitors from home and overseas, subject to appropriate precautionary measures being taken to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>A major tourism marketing reassurance campaign, with a total budget of £10 million, has been designed by Bord Fáilte in consultation with the industry and is under way in key markets. The campaign consists of special media advertising, trade reassurance measures and special promotional visits, including my own recent visit to the United State. Details of the campaign and the actions envisaged in key source markets are available directly from Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reassurance campaign has been put together with the assistance of an additional special Exchequer contribution of £7 million. <Col N="913" /> These actions are incremental to the 2001 budget previously approved for Bord Fáilte which represented the largest ever level of State funding for tourism marketing and brings the total 2001 Exchequer provision for tourism marketing and promotion to £67 million. When the reassurance campaign is taken into account the tourism marketing budget in 2001 represents an increase of approximately £17 million on last years' budget.</P>
    <P>At the last North-South Ministerial Council in tourism sectoral format held in Letterkenny on 30 March, I and my northern counterpart, Sir Reg Empey, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, had a discussion on the implications of the FMD emergency for the tourism industry, North and South. We agreed to keep the situation under review and to consider the possibility of joint marketing promotions in the future.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the measures announced in Northern Ireland on 21 May, from which certain tourism operators adversely affected by the foot and mouth disease crisis, could benefit. While there have been some calls for similar relief measures here, the main focus of industry attention has been to secure extra Exchequer marketing funds and the removal of the more damaging foot and mouth disease advice-control measures. My appeal to the banks drew a welcome response from the Irish Bankers' Federation on 30 March indicating their commitment to give careful and sympathetic consideration to requests for support from those business customers who encounter financial difficulties. The Department of Finance has also confirmed that in so far as particular cash flow problems arise for individual businesses, the Revenue Commissioners, as part of normal arrangements, will look sympathetically at payment arrangements on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>I will keep the overall market under close review with the objective of ensuring that no unnecessary medium to long-term damage is done to the tourism industry, which is now so important in economic terms. The tourism industry has dealt successfully with crises in the past and is a resilient industry. With the help of the actions I have taken and through the industry's efforts, we can overcome this temporary setback and return to a growth pattern again next year.</P>

        <b>: </b>Is the Minister living in the real world? I ask him to walk down Nassau Street when he leaves here. The left half side of that street as one walks towards Merrion Square would be normally chock-a-block at this time of the year with buses carrying Americans who would go into Kilkenny Design and the other shops that sell ethnic goods along that street. There are no buses there except the odd one that has brought people up from rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister disputing the figure given by Bord Fáilte reported this week in <i>The Irish Times</i>? Bord Fáilte estimates that at this stage about £250 million has been lost to the economy by way of tourism revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> In terms of where we go from here, does the Minister accept that irretrievable damage has been done? I welcome marketing in the sector, but at this stage people have made up their minds whether they will come here, go to other parts of Europe or stay at home. Will the Minister accept that what we are involved in at this stage is a salvage mission and that what is required is long-term rather than short-term investment? Will he also accept the figures for this year will not be far more optimistic than the pessimistic ones given by Bord Fáilte, that they could well be catastrophic and many enterprises will go to the wall because the Minister and the Government did not put in place any salvage measures in terms of supports to assist people in the industry who have borrowed to keep their businesses up and running? </P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept certain sectors, such as the coach sector, have been damaged by the foot and mouth disease crisis, but I cannot imagine what the Deputy is suggesting. Is he suggesting I take a fleet of ships to the United States and fill them with buses full of Americans? Could he possibly have done anything more than I have done already? I went on a reassurance campaign to the United States, from where most of the coach business would normally come. Is the Deputy suggesting I should go over there and drag people by the scruff of the neck over here to line the streets of Dublin?</P>
      <P>I am not as pessimistic as the Deputy. If I were to say to him there is nothing happening in Letterkenny or elsewhere in County Donegal having heard that elsewhere, I would not be inclined to go there. I cannot understand where being pessimistic about all this can possibly lead us. As a matter of fact, Donegal is alive. The night life in Letterkenny, Donegal town and Buncrana has been fantastic in recent weeks. There has been perfect sunshine there&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appeal to Ministers and Deputies to adhere to the one minute allocated for supplementary questions and replies to enable as many Members as possible to ask a supplementary question.

      <P>It is not only Opposition members who are pessimistic about the figures, Bord Fáilte deals with people involved in the tourism industry and has heard from those in the industry that they are pessimistic about the numbers coming.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, a helpful business scheme has been set up in the North. Areas of this country, such as the Cooley Peninsula, have been devastated by this crisis. There is no proof in the books of the people involved in the tourism industry to whom I have spoken that the position will be good in the autumn. We all hope it will be. I ask the Minister not to close the door on providing assistance for people involved in the industry. I ask him to reconsider the position in September, because if the bookings are not in by September, they will not be there before the end of the year. Many businesses will need assistance, if the figures for the autumn are not as good as we hope they will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken in the past regarding compensation, but I do not think that is what the Deputy was speaking about. Measures regarding rates review, VAT returns, etc., have been implemented in the UK, but the uptake of them has been unusually low. They do not seem to have worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Cooley Peninsula, £250,000 has been put into that area alone and the people there were grateful for that extra cash from the Government.  I am not saying figures will not be down, but Bord Fáilte's figures are a worst case scenario and have not taken into consideration the advertising campaign hotels and others in the industry have been running in local newspapers. Terrific value for accommodation is being advertised for June, July and August. No one knows what the summer will be like. There were many cancellations for the summer, particularly coach tours. Some Americans told me they wanted to be sure about the position and put off their visit until the autumn or next year. I expect figures for the autumn to be much higher than they were for last year and that figures for next year will make up for much of what we will have lost this year. The figures will be down for this year, but if we <Col N="916" /> could only recover close to the last year's figures, I would be satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that many entrepreneurs are in trouble? Why will the Government not put in place a package similar to that which was put in place in the North and in Wales? Has he had any discussions recently with the ferry companies to ascertain the level of their bookings? Will he make funding available to those companies to enable them to carry out marketing, given that the marketing they carried out earlier this year has been nullified by the foot and mouth disease epidemic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect some businesses will be in a bother, but I saw media coverage of farmhouses that were empty and women in tears and more recent coverage showed those places were bustling again. I am optimistic they can recover. Certain businesses will be affected. The measures that have been in place on a piecemeal basis in the UK and, more recently, in Northern Ireland have not been a success. They were not a success in the UK because it handled the matter completely different from how we handled it. We adopted a damage limiting approach and won that battle. Many people throughout the world admire the way the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development handled the foot and mouth disease threat and the tourism industry in general.</P>
      <P>The ferry companies have been badly hit. I spoke to representatives of those companies recently and they estimate that their figures could be down 30%, which is not good news. I do not intend to give special funding to each of the ferry companies.</P>
      <P>The ferry companies have indicated that it would be much better if I channelled more funding towards the UK market. This would also benefit rural Ireland because the car ferries transport people who travel throughout the country. I will be targeting the UK from now on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister met with Sir Reg Empey in Letterkenny, did he discuss the background to the assistance being provided by the Northern Ireland Executive? Does he feel the tour operators and tourism sector in this country had to first deal with the foot and mouth crisis and then with the challenge from competitors who are receiving assistance in Northern Ireland? Both Bord Fáilte and tourism operators throughout the country are extremely pessimistic at this time and there needs to be some positive development from the Minister in regard to assistance and ensuring the numbers of tourists coming to the country increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister think that the best way to market tourism is to give companies such as Aer Lingus, Irish Ferries and so on a specific budget so that they can target specific elements of the market and encourage people to come to this country? These companies have a good record in <Col N="917" /> that regard and they are the people with the expertise and experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to Aer Lingus and the other companies, last year we set up the tourism marketing partnership to bring the industry and State agencies together so that there would not be an overlap of marketing and there would be clearly defined areas of funding. There was a meeting recently with the tourism marketing partnership on which Aer Lingus and the ferry companies are represented. That aspect has not been asked for, nor do I believe it would work. I am optimistic that we can recover from this setback &ndash; Deputy Higgins used the word &ldquo;salvage&rdquo;. I have always said this is a salvage operation. We are trying to get back to the £6.4 million figure of last year. I am not saying we will achieve this but we will make every effort to do so. This is just the end of May and we have already spent £17 million extra on marketing this year. In regard to our competitors in Northern Ireland, the whole area of rates and so on is different in the UK, and this has not worked.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that we were very unlucky to be so geographically placed in regard to the serious foot and mouth outbreak in the UK and suffered the type of damage raised in the questions, does the Minister think that between now and the end of the year he will be able to take sufficient initiatives abroad &ndash; I am mindful of the points he already raised &ndash; so that they will percolate down through the various services here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">

      <P>We can take initiatives and the industry has taken many initiatives in terms of the value being given in local advertising campaigns. I am currently in the process of trying to work out a date for a visit to the UK, following which I will travel to Europe. Undoubtedly, we have taken a loss here. As the Deputies opposite have pointed out, people have made up their minds. We must decide whether throwing money at the problem at this stage is correct if people have made up their minds about this country or if it would be better to concentrate on next year. I am more inclined to go for the latter. We will continue with this initiative to which we are contributing £17 million. The Minister for Finance is aware that the tourism industry represents 5% of GDP while the agricultural industry represents 4% of GDP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a framework for implementation of strand I of the RAPID programme, catering for urban centres with the greatest concentration of disadvantage, is well advanced. Initial work has been undertaken in each of the 25 areas designated under the programme to put the delivery structures in place. Recently, a national co-ordinator and liaison team of three were appointed following public competition. Local co-ordinators are being recruited by relevant local authorities at present. Once these co-ordinators are in place, area implementation teams already being established will formally commence work on the preparation and drawing together of area action plans which are expected to be completed before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The design of strand II of the programme, catering for rural areas and provincial towns is also under way. The identification and selection of disadvantaged areas in the provincial towns will proceed along lines similar to the process used for strand I and is currently being progressed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Funding for both strand I and strand II will be available under the national development plan, and will be front-loaded to the targeted areas before the end of 2003, according to the priority of needs identified in each of the areas.</P>
      <P>In addition, the selection of disadvantaged rural areas, which will be targeted for special support, is being led by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I welcome the programme, particularly the fact that it will be extended to rural Ireland. I would like to know the progress being made on strand II. I received a reply to a recent parliamentary question that stated it was hoped the parameters would be set for rural areas by the end of the year. Will the Minister of State clarify when applications from the different areas should reach the Department? Given that a working group has been set up under the auspices of the Minister's Department, what progress has been made in this regard? What communication will the Department have with area partnerships, leaders, local authorities and so on in regard to rural areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The rural areas will be covered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. That communication is ongoing and is reasonably well advanced in regard to how the programme will be structured. I will only deal with the 25 areas covered under the RAPID programme for urban areas. Given that there is one <Col N="919" /> national body, perhaps a case could be made for it to look after both rural and urban areas. As far as my Department is concerned, we have not been told we will be dealing with rural areas. At the moment, we will only be dealing with urban areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is confusion at local level in relation to the programme. Is the Minister of State saying the local authorities should deal with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development if they want information on the programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the confusion. There is also a certain amount of confusion in regard to the RAPID programme. That confusion will only be catered for when the local co-ordinators are in place and bring groups together to put a plan together. Once that happens, much of the confusion will disappear. However, until that happens, it will be difficult not to have confusion. In areas where I launch the programme, I find people are still a little bit confused. Once people understand the potential of the programme, they will realise that if everyone works together it can have a huge impact on exclusion, whether in urban or rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there any plans to expand on the 25 locations after they are up and running? While no one disputes that the areas which have been targeted have been badly ravaged over the years, some of which are in the Minister of State's constituency, will he agree that additional areas should be included in the programme, otherwise he will have the same difficulty in 12 or 18 months or two years? It is a pity the Minister with responsibility for tackling the problem of disadvantage in this instance has no responsibility to rural areas. Is it the case that in order to keep Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, happy this element of the budget was passed on to him? Will the Minister of State agree that one Department should have overall responsibility to answer questions rather than be divided between two Departments as it is at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of having 25 areas was to keep the whole programme focused. The general feeling is that if we increased it to 50 areas the focus would be watered down and that at the moment it should not be extended. In my own constituency there are areas that feel they should be included. If we do not keep it focused we will not really tackle the problem. Disadvantage is very concentrated and we have an opportunity to crack and break it with this programme. If we spread it out it will not have the effect we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Focus is a key part of it and the areas chosen are the ones that clearly emerged as the most disadvantaged. The selection was independent and there was no interference in it. As far as the rural areas are concerned, there are discussions going <Col N="920" /> on and we should see some announcements in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that this programme, which is now split into two strands, should be under the responsibility of one Department where experience can be gathered, the programme can be co-ordinated and what has been learned in urban areas can be used to develop the project in rural areas? Is it the case that the reason this budget was given to the Department was to keep the former Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Ned O'Keefe, happy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what my colleague has said. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is also involved. There will be more confusion as a result of this. If we put down parliamentary questions with regard to the RAPID programme we must table one question to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, another to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and another to the Minister here today. It will be very difficult for us to get information through parliamentary questions because we will not know to whom to address the questions. The programme should be under the auspices of one Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The rural end of it will be under the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development but it will not be called RAPID. There is a difference between urban and rural exclusion. When we started this programme we decided just to look at the 25 worst areas regardless of whether they were urban or rural. It soon became clear that they would all be urban areas because we were using the Trutz-Haase deprivation index. That is why we decided we could not confine it to urban areas as there were rural areas with the problem. We decided then that it should be set up independently because&mdash;</P>

      <P>As part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse, the young people's facilities and services fund was established in 1998 to assist in the development of preventative measures in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem existed or had the potential to develop. The aim of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and divert them from the dangers of substance misuse. The national assessment committee for the fund is chaired by my Department and includes a representative of Dublin Corporation. To date, approximately £46 million has been allocated by Government to support over 340 facility and services projects under the fund.</P>
      <P>An external evaluator was recently appointed to examine the overall impact of the fund at national, plan and project level against the targets, objectives and performance indicators agreed. The report of the evaluator, which is expected in September 2002, will identify models of best practice, which will inform the next phase of allocations under the fund.</P>

        <b>:</b> I thank the Minister for his reply and commend him on the work he is doing. What is the current statistic in relation to the number of drug addicts, particularly heroin addicts, within the greater Dublin area? Two years ago it was estimated at something in the region of 14,000. The local task forces were extremely pessimistic in relation to their success in dealing with the issue on the ground. What is the current position in terms of the challenge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is estimated at 13,500 heroin/opiate abusers in the Dublin area. Last year we set up the national advisory committee on drugs and one of their jobs is to try to give us a real assessment of what is happening. They have four sub-committees, one of which is investigating treatment. A number of people felt that the Comiskey figure of 13,500 included some numbers that should not be there. It is likely that it is in or around that figure but we expect to have a harder figure later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister used the term &ldquo;significant risk&rdquo;. What is the definition of substance abuse or drugs we are talking about? Does this include the use or abuse of aerosols which is a growing problem? Does the Minister not agree that there is a broader range of substances of abuse today than there was ten years ago and that the term needs to be broadened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many areas have already drawn down funding and where are those areas? I presume most of them are in Dublin, Cork and the major population centres. Has any work been done to <Col N="922" /> review it in the regional centres where there are also significant substance abuse problems? Even a town such as Athlone has a problem with opiates and it is the same in many other places. Have those problems been addressed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Naughten has asked my question. Has any assessment been done outside the areas where the task force works? There is a major problem. Does the Minister agree that an assessment of the problem needs to be done all over the country and particularly in the schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we did the review of the national drugs strategy which we launched recently we went all round the country. We had eight public fora, some 190 people wrote to us and we met about 34 groups from that. Aerosols did not emerge as a major issue although we had expected them to. They are extremely dangerous but they do not seem to be popular abuse substances. There is a broad range of substances abused, apart from opiates.</P>
      <P>The reason attention comes back to opiates is that heroin is the drug that does most damage to the individual, the family and the community. The drug problem changes dramatically once heroin gets into a community. That is why it always comes back to opiates and why people ask what is happening with other drugs. The review showed clearly, especially in rural areas, that people were far more concerned about the abuse of alcohol and problems of under age drinking than they were about drugs. That was very clear.</P>
      <P>The new regional structures we have set up will identify the problems in their own areas. They will then be able to tap in to the national advisory committee on drugs. That committee will become a very important part of the country's drug policy. It will work on four pillars, supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. Members of this House and people in the media will, no doubt, make much use of the national advisory committee. It has undertaken a huge amount of research, much of which will stand the test of time and will be extremely important for Members of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 19 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to engage independent consultants to undertake an overview of the cost of the proposed Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland project and to assist in determining final Exchequer allocations for the project and the sensitivity of such allocations to variations in the scale of each element of the project.</P>
      <P>The first term of reference set by Government for the consultants, which my Department is in the process of engaging, will be to review the overall approach and contracting strategy adopted to date in securing the development of Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland and associated infrastructure, with regard to risk identification, management processes and structures, timing and overall cost effectiveness. The second term of reference is for the consultants to advise on the assessment of the contract awarding authority for the project, CSID, of the gross cost range and of the Exchequer funding requirements for each facility proposed for the Campus emerging from the outline bid phase due for completion on 21 June, the tendering process for which is now under way.</P>
      <P>The third term of reference is to advise on CSID's assessment, at the end of the outline bid process, of operating costs and revenues likely to be associated with Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland, and the likely net impact on the Exchequer. The fourth term of reference is to assess the estimated costs of relocating existing facilities from the Abbotstown site arising directly from the decision to establish Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland there. The fifth term of reference is to assess the estimated costs of access infrastructure directly attributable to the development of Stadium and Sports Campus Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sixth term of reference is to establish the extent and timing of the likely Exchequer liability associated with the above developments. The seventh term of reference is to ascertain the direct and indirect benefits from the developments outlined above, including the impact of physical development and access on the hinterland of Abbotstown and on the Dublin region and the positive impact of infrastructure development <Col N="924" /> and make recommendations to me as appropriate in the context of the overall purpose of the overview.</P>
    <P>The consultants will liaise with and be guided by a steering group of senior officials, drawn from my Department and the Departments of the Taoiseach, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance. They will be required to deliver a report not later than three months after the date of commissioning. In response to the notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 11 May 2001 inviting expressions of interest to undertake the overview, 15 such expressions were received from consultants by the closing date of 22 May 2001. My Department, in consultation with the steering group, shortlisted eight qualified candidates who have been invited to tender. The closing date for submission of tenders is Friday, 8 June. As the Government decided this overview would be carried out in the manner I have outlined, the question of requesting the Comptroller and Auditor General to undertake the study does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the lengths to which the Government is prepared to go to press ahead with this project, I am concerned. It is difficult to imagine any commercial consultants retaining true independence. The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is the only body that can guarantee constitutional independence when assessing this project. The Government continually complains that the Opposition and others do not share its support for this project. Does the Minister agree that people are entitled to be concerned about the use of such a large amount of public funds?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister is about to appoint consultants to review this project following a decision on 8 June, will he give a commitment that no contracts will be signed until the review has been completed? Will the entire campus be reviewed, or will the review focus on the stadium, which is by far the most controversial element of the project?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Moynihan-Cronin's question, we are all concerned about costs. I look forward to the overview as there have been nothing but negative vibes from the other side of the House. We are all concerned about the costs of projects. Deputies have spoken of millions being poured into the stadium, despite the fact that only 0.4% of Exchequer funding goes to sport. This country's traditions have made its people averse to risk, but we have tried to reposition our thinking in the past ten or 12 years. All investment involves a form of risk, but it is not necessarily a total gamble. Millions of pounds have been invested in research and every research project is a step into the unknown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit we must be prudent and reduce risk but the only way to eliminate risk is to do absolutely nothing. This country has not been built on such <Col N="925" /> an attitude in the last ten to 12 years, as there has been an entrepreneurial spirit here in that time. Thankfully, Fianna Fáil has been in Government for ten of the 12 years, seven with the Progressive Democrats and three with the Labour Party. To be fair to Fine Gael, we cannot enter coalition with that party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology, <Col N="926" /> Deputy Treacy. The Volex Interconnect Systems limited plant is located on Breaffy Road in Castlebar. It was built in the past few years and cost more than £8 million. It has been a good employer in Castlebar since it was first sited there by the Cable Products company, making computer terminal connections.</P>
      <P>I visited the factory recently following the lay-off of a number of short-term contract workers to express my concerns to the managing director and members of the workforce. It is obvious that the computer industry is subject to international pressures from competitive elements. It is necessary that skills be upgraded, that research and development take place and that we move on to new niche markets in specialist areas.</P>
      <P>I understand from the managing director of Volex Interconnect that the company intends to make the Castlebar plant their global research and development centre and that the company is planning to move into fibreoptic communications. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, knows that both technological companies and call centres operating from the west are severely disadvantaged by a lack of capacity. The fibreoptic cable which will be manufactured in Castlebar has the range and capacity to take all calls made in Ireland at any given time. It is ironic that a plant manufacturing such a product, and that will be shifting the emphasis of its workforce to do so, is limited by a lack of capacity, as are other plants in the west. I am sure the Minister of State will deal with this in his reply.</P>
      <P>Volex Interconnect applied for a specialist research and development grant which has been processed for over 12 months without coming to fruition. That should not be the case. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said in a recent Dáil reply that Ireland will continue to be at the leading competitive edge and that the Government will do whatever is necessary to ensure we remain there. The Government and the State agencies should support the company given that it has spent money on a new plant, intends to make an Irish location its centre of research and development and plans to transfer its workforce into a new area of competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I express my concern about this sensitive issue to the Minister of State. Although it has been agreed with unions, it is worrying that 130 workers are on short-term work. The company, union and workforce involved are all made up of good people. I invite the Minister of State to visit the plant at his leisure so he can see the pristine laboratories that are waiting for research and development to begin. I hope the grant application made by the company will be processed favourably and quickly. If the Minister of State has time in the next four or five weeks, he should go to Castlebar to see what the company manufactures and to assure workers that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the rest of the Government will assist and encourage them to continue to be a leading edge company in the technological area. The workers will <Col N="927" /> be delighted to hear such an assurance from a Minister of State responsible for science and technology.</P>

      <P>Volex Group plc is a public company quoted on the London Stock Exchange which designs, manufactures and markets a wide range of interconnect-cable assemblies to original equipment manufacturers globally. Volex's customers include the world's leading electrical and electronic manufacturers. The company is a global supplier with manufacturing facilities in Ireland, the UK, Croatia, Estonia, USA, Canada, Mexico, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and China. More than 10,000 people are employed in the group.</P>
      <P>The Irish operation is Volex Limited in Castlebar which was established as Cable Products in 1987, a manufacturer of cable assemblies. Its original focus was on targeting local customers in the IT hardware sector. As the IT hardware industry developed, Volex refocused on the networking-server and telecommunications segment of the IT industry. Castlebar is the headquarters for Volex Europe.</P>
      <P>Due to recent fall in demand because of the turbulence in the telecommunications and networking industries and a slow-down in the installation of third generation telecommunication equipment, the company has been experiencing a reduction in orders from the telecommunications sector. This is not just a local issue but an international problem. As a result, yesterday 30 May 2001, the company put 100 people on short-term working for approximately one month.</P>
      <P>The company experiences increases and decreases in demand for its product from time to time and the recent short-term working is a normal reaction to changes in the pattern of demand for its product. Volex Limited has delivered a strong financial performance in recent years. While currently the whole group is experiencing a softened market, it is anticipated that when the market recovers strong growth will return.</P>
      <P>There are a number of positive developments in relation to employment in County Mayo in recent years. IDA Ireland has had significant success in attracting new projects to the county. In 1998, Lionbridge Technologies established its European software test centre in Ballina and currently employs 51 permanent employees. In 2000, Dekko Heating Technologies established its European manufacturing operation at Bunree Industrial Estate and at full production will create 80 jobs. Coca-Cola has completed the construction and commissioning of its facility in Ballina which employs 178 people. In 2000, the German company, Schutz, established an industrial packaging manufacturing operation at the Asahi facility in Killala to supply the needs of Coca-Cola and other customers in Ireland. It will provide 25 new jobs at full production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> In 1999, the Cedar Group plc, a UK company, established a call centre in Castlebar. The centre already employs 61 people. They have also established a software development centre in Castlebar which employs 56 software developers.</P>
    <P>Over the past 18 months IDA Ireland has radically changed its policies with the aim of delivering half of all new green field jobs into Objective 1 regions, which include Mayo, in the coming years. This involves doubling the proportion of green field jobs negotiated for these regions. In 2000, 50% of all jobs negotiated by IDA Ireland during the year in green field investment projects were secured for Objective 1 regions.</P>
    <P>The processing of a research and development grant is a day to day matter between the company and IDA Ireland. However, I understand that IDA Ireland responded directly on the matter to the Deputy on 18 May last. As Minister of State responsible for science, technology and commerce and for research, technological development and innovation, I can tell the House that we have put £2 billion into our national development plan for these areas of activity. We want to create world class research centres in information communications technology and biotechnology. With our corporation tax and the investment environment in Ireland, and the highest rate of return in the modern world for international companies, we warmly welcome this application for a grant from this company. If the company wants to communicate directly with me on the matter, I will be delighted to assist it in collaborating on behalf of the company with this application. The Deputy can be certain that IDA Ireland will give this a definitive response as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Rail Network.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the matter of investment in the rail service, including the lines and rolling stock serving large provincial towns, and in particular the line between Portlaoise and Dublin. Greater investment is needed in the rail line to Portlaoise. Recently it was proposed to increase the line to Kildare town to a four-track line. It is essential that this four-track line be extended to Portlaoise.</P>
      <P>There is also a proposal to invest in the rail line between Portlaoise and Dublin and to reopen the railway station in Monasterevin. That is very welcome. I also note that there is a plan to improve the Arrow service in nearby Athy in the near future. However, County Laois &ndash; and Portlaoise town is the county town of County Laois and the nearest county capital in the Border-midland region to the capital city &ndash; is not getting sufficient investment in its rolling stock and track network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is highlighted by the frequency of trains leaving Portlaoise in the morning during the rush hour when four trains leave the town, and the fact that only two trains make the return journey from Heuston Station to Portlaoise. There is a good <Col N="929" /> service in the morning but only half a service in the evening. I am critical of Iarnród Éireann and its management of its network in terms of how it affects County Laois. All monopolies are wrong, and the worst kind of monopoly is a State monopoly, which Iarnród Éireann is. It sees itself as a train company, not as a company providing a service for customers.</P>
    <P>It is ludicrous that there are inter-city trains from Dublin to Cork and Dublin to Limerick and that some of these stop at Templemore but not at Portlaoise. That means it is often possible to travel from Dublin to Templemore much more quickly than from Dublin to Portlaoise. At 5.10 p.m. an inter-city train leaves Heuston Station, passing through but not stopping at Portlaoise, and usually there are empty seats on that train. At 5.20 p.m. another inter-city train leaves Heuston Station for Limerick City with empty seats on most occasions and it does not stop in Portlaoise. At 5.30 p.m. a train leaves Heuston Station which does stop in Portlaoise and up to 120 people regularly stand due to lack of seats. This is unsafe, and from a health and safety point of view it is not acceptable to commuters in County Laois. That there are empty seats on two trains and people have to stand on the train leaving shortly afterwards is clearly a management issue. It is unsatisfactory that Iarnród Éireann is aware of the situation but is not dealing with it.</P>
    <P>A great deal of money is being invested to ensure we have a motorway to Portlaoise. We need parallel investment in the rail network to Portlaoise. If we do not have it, people will be driven off the train and on to the new motorway and we will have a 20-mile tailback at Newlands Cross every day for the rest of our lives. We need an upgraded rail service for Portlaoise. It makes no sense in terms of the national development plan to improve the road network and leave the rail service to be the poor relation. We must have equality of service and if we have a good, reliable and safe train service, it is the best way to commute between places like Portlaoise and Dublin on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>The problem is that Iarnród Éireann does not know whether Portlaoise station is a commuter station or a long distance station. It offers a commuter ticket service but not a commuter train service. We are paying for the service from Portlaoise on a daily basis but we are not getting a regular service. All the towns on the way up from Portlaoise have an adequate and frequent service. However, the people of Portlaoise are not being adequately served. It is essential, as part of the overall national development plan, that additional funding be provided to improve the rail network servicing Portlaoise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that continuing growth in the economy has resulted in increasing pressure on our infrastructure, including the rail network, to cope with this growth. It is readily acknowledged that the rail<Col N="930" /> ways in particular have historically suffered from under-investment under successive Governments and have not kept pace with the demands placed upon them. Faced with this the Government, since coming to power in 1997, has intensified the vital national task of revitalising the country's public transport system. We are now urgently addressing the deficiencies caused by the many preceding years of neglect. The Government plans to spend £2 billion over the next seven years on public transport. We have not seen that level of investment in public transport since the peak of the railway development in the late 19th century. A total of £500 million will be spent on revitalising the mainline rail network. Of this, £350 million will be spent on completing the five year railway safety programme. A total of 490 kilometres of track will be renewed across the network. A sum of £150 million will be spent on railway renewal, especially on new rolling stock and the refurbishment of stations.</P>
      <P>The national development plan also provides for investment of over £185 million in the suburban rail network in the greater Dublin area. Provision has been made in the plan for the purchase of new diesel railcars and the quadrupling of the rail track between Hazelhatch and Sallins to separate long distance and suburban services on the Kildare rail corridor.</P>
      <P>The Government has always acknowledged that the country is coming from behind in terms of railway investment. It must be noted that there is a significant lead-in time required, especially in terms of the putting into place of such things as new trackwork and rolling stock. This must be allowed for. The delivery timescale for trackwork and rolling stock is as short as is prudent.</P>
      <P>Progress has already been made in delivering the ambitious targets contained in the national development plan for suburban rail services in the greater Dublin area. Two of these projects will have a significant impact on services into Dublin from the south and west, Portlaoise and the new station being built at present in Monasterevin. Plans to quadruple the trackwork on the Kildare corridor are at an advanced design stage. This project will allow the separation of long distance and suburban trains and will significantly increase the carrying capacity of the route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant work is also under way at Heuston Station, which will result in more platforms and more efficient track layout on the approaches to the station. This, too, will serve to increase the number of arrivals and departures that can be handled at the station. In addition, 80 new diesel railcars are due to come into service on Ireland's railways in 2002 and 2003. The new railcars will provide substantial improvement in the quality of long distance commuting services. This development, combined with the plans to provide substantial additional capacity for suburban trains on the track network into Heuston Station, is designed to provide a substantial improvement in <Col N="931" /> the quality and frequency of rail services from towns such as Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked me to apologise to Deputy Fleming for not being present for the debate this evening.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the Minister and the House for my tardiness in arriving for this debate and I thank the Chair for allowing me to take it now. Malahide Community School currently has approximately 1,050 second level students. The building was constructed in the 1970s when the school changed from a convent school to a community school. It was one of the first community schools. Since then it has been providing excellent education for the students of Malahide. I must declare a personal interest in the school. My three sons went to the school and I served on its board of management for a number of years.</P>
      <P>The school is extremely popular and has a great record of results. The parents of the students in the feeder national schools wish to send their children to Malahide Community School. As a result, the school has become one of the largest in the country. Last year the board of management informed the Minister that it would be unable to take in all the students applying for entry and would have to refuse entry to some. The Department of Education and Science pleaded with the board to accept all the students on the basis of its providing temporary accommodation, that is, prefabricated buildings. The management, anxious to accommodate the local students, agreed to take the temporary accommodation and to accept all students who sought entry.</P>
      <P>That was done on the firm understanding that progress would be made in providing a new school on the campus. The school campus contains the school building and the nice old original school building which is supposed to function as a concert hall or theatre for the students and the local community. However, it is currently divided into three classrooms. The school is bursting at the seams. A design team has been appointed for the school and I hope its recommendation will be for a new school rather than an extension.</P>
      <P>There are serious problems with the existing flat roofed building. Many schools were built with flat roofs in the 1970s. The roof of Malahide Community School is constantly leaking and the windows and heating system need to be replaced. If the Department decides on an extension, it will mean 1,100 students will be on campus while builders are trying to stitch a new building to the existing building. That would probably not be permitted under the health and safety regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to agree to the construction of a new school. The previous Minister, Deputy Martin, met with the parents and the board and appears to have given an undertaking that a new school will be built. The current Minister has <Col N="932" /> written letters about it. What progress is being made? Will this building be ready in 2002? If not, students will have to be refused entry. The school will not accept more prefabricated buildings unless building is commenced on a new two storey school on the site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the provision of additional accommodation at Malahide Community School.</P>
      <P>In June 1998, the school authority made an application to the Department for an extension of the school accommodation. The Department requested the school authority to provide information on the internal arrangements it would propose for a projected long-term enrolment of 1,050 pupils. On receipt of this information a schedule of overall accommodation was prepared by the Department for agreement by the school authority.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, the school authority indicated it considered that a long-term projected enrolment of 1,200 pupils in the school was more realistic and appealed to the Department to revise the figure of 1,050 to 1,200. This has been done and a revised schedule of overall accommodation has been prepared based on the higher figure. The Department commissioned a feasibility study on the school in April 2000. The study is based on the original long-term projected enrolment of 1,050 and consequent schedule of overall accommodation.</P>
      <P>This study put forward three options for the provision of additional accommodation at Malahide Community School. Option 1 proposed renovation and extension of the existing accommodation at an estimated cost of £3.85 million inclusive of VAT; Option 2 proposed demolishing the existing building and building a new two storey school on existing school lands at an estimated cost of £5.686 million inclusive of VAT; Option 3 was a variation of Option 2 and also proposed demolishing the existing building and rebuilding on unused school lands at an estimated cost of £5.835 million inclusive of VAT.</P>
      <P>Upon examination of the feasibility study, Option 1 appeared to be the most cost effective option, particularly taking into account the recently completed re-roofing and drainage projects at the school. The re-roofing project was carried out at a cost of £287,871.55. The drainage works were carried out at a cost of £229,981.50. However, I am aware that the preferred option of the school community is a new building. Officials from the Department have met with representatives from the school authority to discuss this project and to agree an approach that will lead to the delivery of additional permanent accommodation for the school at the earliest possible date, in view of accommodation pressures at the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An advertisement seeking applications for inclusion on a full design team &ndash; that is, a suitably qualified architect, quantity surveyor, struc<Col N="933" /> tural engineer and mechanical and electrical engineer &ndash; for this project has been placed in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The closing date for receipt of applications in response to this advertisement is 12 June 2001. The intention is to have the design team appointed by 31 August next at the latest. As soon as the applicants have been short-listed, representatives from the school authority will be invited to partake in the selection process for the design team.</P>
    <P>The design team will be engaged to re-develop the school. This means that a decision as to whether additional accommodation will be provided by means of refurbishment and extension of the existing premises or whether there will be a completely new building will be incorporated into the design process. This avoids setting parameters for the design team which may impact on the early delivery of the additional accommodation. Issues such as value for money, the projected lifespan of a refurbished portion of the building and the availability of outdoor play space for the school must also be considered. The design team will also be asked to explore the possibility of a phased delivery of the project. If this is possible, it may result in some additional accommodation being available to the school prior to the overall completion of the project.</P>
    <P>Possible interim solutions to the difficulties regarding the shortage of accommodation have been discussed with the school authority. The school authority has agreed to revert to our Department if they require temporary accommodation during the construction of the new permanent accommodation.</P>
    <P>Our Department is undertaking to make every effort to complete the architectural design of this project, up to and including the obtaining of planning permission, in order to be in a position to invite tenders for a construction contract as quickly as possible. It is envisaged that this will involve all of the parties involved in the project &ndash; the school, the Department of Education and Science and the professional design team &ndash; working in close liaison throughout the life of the project. I trust that this information is to the satisfaction of the Deputy, the House and the people of Malahide.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Drumconrath (Meath) Water Supply.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment and welcome the fact that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who also represents the constituency concerned, is here to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past six weeks a serious problem has arisen with the water supply in Drumconrath, County Meath, due to algae on the lake. This lake supplies some 900 households, including farms. Many of the extensions to the scheme provided by the local authority to the village of Drumconrath took place through local involvement in <Col N="934" /> group schemes on the outskirts of the village and this water supply is availed of by people, some of whom live as far away as Nobber and a substantial way along the Carrickmacross road and other roads out of the village.</P>
    <P>The council has had this problem for the past six weeks and has tried to no avail to sort it out. A month or five weeks have passed and while the supply is deemed okay for drinking, were it not for the increased fluoridation I do not think this would be the case. That said, I believe that because the supply is coming mainly from a stagnant lake, where there is no through-flow of water, there is a need to find a new supply.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter on Monday at the county council meeting, I was informed that the local authority was in the process of starting to look for an alternative ground water supply. It will probably take more than one or two of these boreholes to solve the problem. I have also been informed that it will cost well in excess of £100,000.</P>
    <P>The local authority has a small schemes' programme and has money in that particular kitty, but I am afraid that other schemes, for which that money has been earmarked in 2001, will be put on the backburner because the money is required immediately for the improvement of this scheme. I am asking, therefore, that the Minister, who I know has been in contact with the local authority on the matter, should inform me today that moneys will be made available by the local authority, if and when required, so that no stone will be left unturned to ensure the improvement of the supply and that money will not be an obstacle.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that if there is the possibility of providing a system of new filters, they would come at an enormous cost, and that there is no guarantee such improvement of the filters will actually solve the problem. I believe that the real solution to the problem lies in finding new sources and ensuring that his Department makes money available to the local authority, if and when required, to pay for the necessary improvements.</P>
    <P>As our colleague stated this week, the water is worse in colour than any dose ever given to cattle years ago or even nowadays. People continue to inform me through my constituency office on a daily basis that the smell of the water is unbelievable and outrageous. No doubt the Minister will give some comfort to the people dependent on this supply. The fact that it is in our own constituency should make it that much easier to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought when we lost Deputy John Bruton as leader of the Fine Gael Party that perhaps the new leader would not give as much attention to matters in Meath but I was delighted to see him as concerned about this as Deputy Farrelly obviously is. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter which is a cause of grave concern to the people of Drumconrath and a wide region around that village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" /> As the Deputy will be aware, the source of the Drumconrath water supply is Lough Bracken, which is situated about one mile from the village. The treatment system, which is near the in-take from the lake, consists of filtration, disinfection with chlorine, and fluoridation. The treatment plant produces 850 cubic meters &ndash; approximately 187,000 gallons &ndash; of water per day, serving a population of nearly 1,000, which is slightly larger than Deputy Farrelly stated.</P>
    <P>In February last, the lake was affected by an algal bloom. This is a rare occurrence and at the time the cause was not determined. It is, however, generally associated with certain weather conditions combined with nutrient levels in the lake water. The emergency treatment for this condition is the use of barley straw, which kills off the algae. This treatment was applied in this case and the algal problem was eliminated.</P>
    <P>However, the residue of the algae is still in the lake and the filtration system is unable to deal effectively with this residue, resulting in an unpleasant taste and colour. It is important to state that the results of regular monitoring by Meath County Council and the health board did not deem the treated water unfit for human consumption. Nevertheless, I understand that Meath County Council began providing tankered water to the village early this week as a short-term solution to the problem. As Deputy Farrelly made clear, I know that, no matter what we say, when there is a smell similar to the one involved here, one will not convince people that the water is safe but it is important that we say it is safe.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the national development plan, which runs from 2000 to 2006, promises unprecedented investment in our water services infrastructure. Last year I announced a £2.1 billion investment programme for the period 2000 to 2002. Under this package, 28 schemes were approved for Meath costing almost £77 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> The Water Services Investment Programme, 2000-2002, took into account the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Meath County Council in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake a fresh assessment of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals. The Deputy will appreciate that no proposals regarding the water supply to Drumconrath were included in the list submitted by Meath County Council. However, the Water Services Investment Programme is a rolling programme which is sufficiently flexible to allow new schemes to be introduced as other imperatives emerge, for example, social, economic or environmental issues requiring the fast tracking of individual projects needed for particular purposes. Meath County Council, as the Deputy stated, is investigating the causes of the algal bloom but as it may prove difficult to isolate and eliminate these factors, the council is also investigating other possible sources of supply. I understand that the council will commence, today or tomorrow, the drilling of boreholes in the vicinity of the lake, to establish if alternative groundwater sources are available. The possibility of upgrading of the treatment plant to cater for these conditions will also be examined by the council.</P>
    <P>If my Department receives any submission from the council in the context of the Water Services Investment Programme the Deputy can take it that it will be dealt with immediately it comes to hand. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 20, 41, 48, 150, and 157 together.</P>
      <P>I have had two formal meetings with the Olympic Council of Ireland since the Sydney Olympics. The meetings took place on 8 November 2000 and 8 March 2001. The main items discussed were Ireland's participation and performance at the Sydney games, how the Irish team prepared for the games, the levels of care and management available to Irish competitors during the games and how the relevant organisations, agencies and resources might be more effectively utilised in the future in achieving and maintaining high levels of performance in the Olympics. My Department has also acquired a copy of the Olympic Council of Ireland's official Sydney report.</P>
      <P>In the four years leading up to the Sydney games the Government allocated more than £10 million to the national governing bodies of Olympic sports. In the year of the games alone, a further special allocation of £1 million was made to assist with Olympic preparation costs. Since 1998 £4.5 million approximately has been allocated to our top competitors for their individual development.</P>
      <P>Because of my concerns in relation to the performance of so many of our competitors in Sydney, I requested the Irish Sports Council to carry out an indepth review of Ireland's preparation for and participation in Sydney, including the supports, programmes and schemes which where put in place leading up to Sydney. The report of the review, including recommendations for Athens 2004, was published on 6 February 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Sports Council, in co-operation with the other relevant bodies, is well under way in the implementation of the recommendations con<Col N="939" /> tained in the report. A meeting of the key agencies, including the OCI, national governing bodies and the National Coaching and Training Centre has taken place and all parties have committed themselves to the recommendations and to the spirit of co-operation required in the lead up to Athens 2004 and beyond.</P>
    <P>The council has also established a high performance committee to assist and advise it in the development of a high performance strategy for Irish sport. Among the members of the group are the OCI, the Paralympic Council and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland. The review of the future role and structure of the NCTC is also under way and a new board of management, as well as a new memorandum of agreement and terms of reference for the centre's operation, are in place.</P>
    <P>A number of Olympic governing bodies have already commenced the development of performance plans for their sports and a liaison group has been established between the Sports Council and the OCI to help maintain liaison and co-operation between both bodies and. very importantly, to drive and monitor the implementation of the Sydney review recommendations.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget, the Government announced its intention to double the annual budget for the sports council over the next four years to £20 million to assist it in its work. I am satisfied that the preparations for future Olympic success are well under way and that satisfactory co-operation is being achieved thus far in the process from all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 16, 18 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>As I have set out in the House on previous occasions, Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Limited estimate the cost of the sports-campus Ireland project to be £550 million. This includes the cost of the 80,000 seat stadium as estimated in the PricewaterhouseCoopers feasibility study entitled A Stadium for the New Century, namely £230 million.</P>
      <P>The other facilities included in the tender competition for bids now under way for sports-campus Ireland include a 15,000 to 20,000 seat multi-purpose indoor arena; indoor-outdoor training facilities for all sports; a sports science and medical centre; headquarters accommodation for the national governing bodies of sport; accommodation for athletes; a tennis centre; a golf academy; a velodrome; a 100 acre parkland; a major children's play area-educational facility; and hotels, restaurants and parking. The national aquatic and leisure centre, to be known as the Pool @ Abbotstown, was the subject of a separate tender competition and which is now complete.</P>
      <P>CSID estimated that the private sector will contribute £150 million to the cost of the project and a further £50 million has been offered as a private donation. This leaves an estimated Exchequer requirement of £350 million. These costs do not provide for infrastructural works in the Dublin 15 area, which have already been provided for in the national development plan and which are being considered by a high level group set up by the Government and chaired by the secretary generals of the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>The outline bids for stadium and sports-campus Ireland, which are due to be received by CSID on 21 June, will be the first response from the market to the costs of building the proposed facilities. I am happy to await the outcome of this process and the report of the independent cost overview, which my Department is currently in the process of commissioning, so that the Government can determine the best way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures I have quoted are best estimates. The figures, which were quoted in an internal minute from a senior officer in the Department of Finance to his Minister were his personal estimates, as far as I understand, and not based on any detailed analysis of which I am aware. As the Deputy is aware, there have been many estimates provided by commentators and even by Members of the House. It is in order that the best information possible on the likely cost of the project is made available that the Government has decided that my Department should commission the above mentioned independent cost overview, which will be managed by a steering group com<Col N="941" /> prising the secretaries general of my Department, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the second secretary of the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte was the implementing body for tourism product development under the Tourism Operational Programme 1994-99, with decisions on grant approval being made by an independent product management board. A similar arrangement will be in place for the period of the current national development plan under which I was able to obtain a commitment of £100 million, to be co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, for tourism product development. The remaining £250 million that I secured for tourism under the NDP is for marketing and human resource management.</P>
      <P>The new tourism product investment scheme will be administered via the tourism measures of the regional operational programmes. The overall objective of the scheme is to develop the tourism product in a sustainable way that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas and increases the under performing regions' share of overseas tourism revenue.</P>
      <P>There is a general consensus that the focus of public investment in tourism projects must be to enhance the potential of less developed tourism areas by supporting the development of significant attractions or clusters of attractions in such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hotels continue to benefit from the capital allowance scheme under which capital expenditure on any building or structure in use as a hotel <Col N="942" /> or holiday camp, registered with Bord Fáilte, may qualify for capital allowances. Beneficiaries are entitled to claim a maximum 15% capital allowance in years one to six and 10% in the final year. As recently as February last, the Irish Hotels Federation, in its document Blueprint for the Future &ndash; A strategic Review and Recommendations for the Irish Hotel and Guesthouse Industry, affirmed that capital allowances remain the most important form of incentive available to hotels.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the contribution that small accommodation providers, including small hotels, have made to tourism and I recognise the need to encourage and develop the sector. An initiative, targeted primarily at the small accommodation provider, has been launched whereby Bord Fáilte carried out a fundamental review of how the various groups in this category were branded and marketed overseas &ndash; with a view to increasing business overall and particularly in off season and in rural areas. Almost £1.4 million has been set aside for this initiative to date and it has considerably expanded the range of support offered to the sector, thereby developing the marketing capabilities of the operators themselves.</P>
    <P>Detailed guidelines for project promoters on the new tourism product investment scheme have been drafted by Bord Fáilte in consultation with my Department. Meanwhile the scheme is still being examined under the State aids rules by DG Competition of the European Commission, to whom the scheme has been formally notified as required by the relevant legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 38, 44 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The new National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 was launched by the Taoiseach and myself on 10 May. Prepared and published by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, it is the most comprehensive analysis and assessment of the drugs problem in Ireland ever undertaken and it provides the basis from which all those involved in addressing the drug problem can work for the next seven years.</P>
      <P>Copies have been lodged in the Oireachtas Library and further copies are available from the Government Publication Office at Molesworth Street, Dublin 2.</P>
      <P>The objective of the review was to identify any gaps or deficiencies in the strategy, develop revised strategies and, if necessary, new arrangements through which to deliver them. As part of the review, the latest available data on the extent and nature of drug misuse in the country as a whole were identified. To be as comprehensive as possible the review also looked at international trends, developments and best practice models.</P>
      <P>An extensive consultation process was also undertaken. Approximately 190 submissions were received from a range of individuals and organisations and a series of eight regional consultative fora were held in June 2000. This gave individuals and groups an opportunity to outline their views on how the existing strategy might be improved or adapted. Approximately 600 people attended these fora. In addition, I met, separately, 34 interested groups, Departments and agencies. I also visited Sweden, Australia and Switzerland to examine how the drugs strategies of those countries operated.</P>
      <P>A variety of issues were raised during the consultation process centering mainly around the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</P>
      <P>The new National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 is the first time that all elements of drugs policy in Ireland have been brought together into a single framework with responsibilities clearly assigned. Around the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, a series of objectives and key performance indicators have been set with specific targets that Departments and agencies are required to meet. A series of 100 individual actions have also been developed which the relevant bodies have to carry out in order to deliver the strategy and meet its objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation will have responsibility for the co-ordination of the implementation of the strategy. The interdepartmental group on drugs, which I will chair, will establish an evaluation framework against which progress on the strategy will be measured. The IDG will report on progress to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion every six months. These reports will form the basis for an <Col N="944" /> annual report on progress implementing the strategy which I intend to have published each year. A mid-term evaluation of the overall strategy will be carried out in 2004 to determine its overall effectiveness. This will allow priorities to be identified and a re-focusing, if necessary, of strategic objectives for the remainder of the strategy up to 2008.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations in the new strategy is that regional drugs task forces be set up throughout the country to develop appropriate policies for their regions. While heroin misuse remains predominantly a Dublin phenomenon, drug misuse is occurring throughout the country. The regional drugs task forces will have a key role to play in the area of prevention and will also be responsible for identifying and addressing any gaps in service provision to tackle the drug problem in their areas. The new strategy will, therefore, be a national policy and will cover the entire country.</P>
    <P>The regional drugs task forces will be established in all the ten health board areas by the end of 2001. The cost of implementing the various actions outlined in the strategy is currently being examined by Departments with a view to seeking funding through the upcoming annual Estimates process and in future years.</P>

      <P>The current position in relation to the replacement pool proposal in Cobh is that approval has been given to Cobh UDC to seek tenders for the work involved.</P>
      <P>In relation to the pool proposal for Youghal, additional documentation has been received from the council in connection with the preliminary report, which will now be considered by our technical advisors. Subject to the satisfactory completion of this stage of the process, consideration will then be given to approval of the preliminary report thus allowing the council to proceed to the next stage, that is the preparation of detailed contract documents.</P>

      <P>An amount of £220 million has been provided under the social inclusion and child care sub-programme of the Regional Operational Programmes to support the local development work of area based partnerships and ADM community groups over the life of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. A sum of £122 million has also been provided for the national drugs strategy under the sub-programme for this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local development measure required that local action plans were drawn up by partnership companies and ADM community groups, in consultation with the director of community and enterprise of the relevant city and county development boards. These plans were submitted to ADM Limited by December 2000 and were <Col N="946" /> evaluated by ADM's appraisal committee for the southern and eastern region and for the Border, midlands and western region. The allocation of funding for the period 2000 to 2003 has now taken place.</P>
    <P>Allocations are subject to an annual review and the amounts allocated may be varied and decreased on the basis of the effectiveness of groups in carrying out their plan.</P>
    <P>In 2000, more than £16 million was drawn down under the new local development measure. Completion of work under the previous local development programme, OPLURD, also took place in 2000 which amounted to funding of a further £6 million. In 2001, £34.5 million has been allocated to ADM for partnerships and community groups to implement their action plans. Of this amount £15.17 million has already been drawn down by ADM between January and April 2001 in relation to the January-June period.</P>
    <P>Under the drugs initiative more than £9 million was drawn down under the NDP in 2000. This amount relates to expenditure under the existing local drugs task force plans. The final evaluations of these action plans was completed last year as a result of which 140 projects were mainstreamed and are now being provided as part of the mainline services by relevant State agencies. The task forces are currently in the process of submitting new plans for assessment by the national drugs strategy team and for approval by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. To date 11 plans have been approved and £6.9 million has been earmarked in respect of these plans to provide, by way of pilot, a wide variety of new initiatives in the areas of supply reduction, treatment, rehabilitation and prevention, as well as awareness and education. The remaining plans are expected later in the year. Only £60,000 has as a result, been drawn down to date, relating to administrative and operational expenses and expenditure is expected to accelerate considerably as soon as the projects provided for under the approved plans are up and running.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 29 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>Among the main functions of the Irish Sports Council, which was established on a statutory basis from 1 July 1999, is the promotion of increased participation in recreational sport and the achievement of excellence in sport in Ireland. The council supports and assists a wide range of programmes and initiatives through the national governing bodies of sport and other organisations and agencies in meeting its responsibilities in these areas.</P>
      <P>The Government and the social partners in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness supported the establishment of local sports partnerships as a further means of creating sustainable sports development infrastructure at local level and in increasing participation in sport. I am pleased that eight pilot local sports partnerships were announced by the sports council earlier this month. An immediate priority for each partnership will be the creation of a local sports strategy. All of the key agencies, which resource and sustain local sport, will be involved in the development and delivery of the local sports strategy. Agencies that have already contributed to the development of this initiative at national level include: vocational education committees, local authorities, health boards and FÁS. Their representatives will engage at local level with the third level sector, commercial interests, sports clubs-organisations, schools, facility operators and voluntary-community groups to ensure that each local sports partnership delivers quality opportunities to everyone at local level. I expect that involvement of local sports stars as role models will be amongst the initiatives to be considered.</P>
      <P>The sports council is also co-operating with the Department of Education and Science in relation to improving the position of sport in schools in conjunction with the development of new physical education curricula being introduced.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department continues to provide substantial funding under its capital programmes to assist organisations, clubs, community groups and local authorities in the provision of sport and recreational facilities to cater for a broad spectrum of sports and activities, for all levels of participation, at national, regional and local levels throughout the country.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, has established a cross-sectoral task force on sport at primary school level. The Departments and agencies identified by Deputy Keaveney are represented on this group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>In giving effect to the commitment outlined in the review of An Action Programme for the Millennium I have secured £45 million funding for an accelerated programme of investment over the three year period 2000 to 2002 in the refurbishment and provision of new pools under the local authority swimming pool programme. The package effectively increased the annual budget from £3 million per annum to £15 million per year over the period.</P>
      <P>Under the swimming pool programme grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. There are four stages in the approval process for a swimming pool project and my Department gives consideration to progressing each proposal to the next stage in the context of funding available.</P>
      <P>A total of 51 proposals were submitted to my Department by local authorities under this accelerated swimming pool programme by last year's closing date of 31 July 2000. Decisions have been made in the case of five proposals and the remaining 46 proposals are at various stages of the approval process. As many as 26 of these proposals relate to the construction of new or replacement pools while a further 20 relate to the refurbishment of existing pools.</P>
      <P>While no project has been completed to date under the 2000 programme, the Deputy should be aware that under the local authority swimming pool programme new pools have been built already or are under construction at Ennis, Dundalk, Navan, Gorey-Courtown, Wicklow town, Renmore and Enniscorthy. Refurbishments have been completed or are currently being undertaken in Arklow, Monaghan, Roscommon, Waterford Tipperary, Newcastle West and Mullingar.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply to Question No. 415 on 3 April 2001, responsibility for promoting the regions rests with Bord Fáilte, the relevant regional tourism authorities and the industry in each region.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte is currently providing funding for a series of marketing initiatives by the regional tourism authorities. Meanwhile the new tourism product investment scheme under the national development plan, which will also be implemented by Bord Fáilte and which I expect to launch shortly, will have a strong focus on less developed tourism areas. It cannot be emphasised often enough that successful realisation of the tourism product development strategy and achievement of its redistribution objective is dependent on, and directly linked to, the delivery by relevant local and other authorities of the necessary infrastructure, facilities and controls.</P>

      <P>The latest survey by the Forfás EMU Business Awareness Campaign, which was <Col N="950" /> carried out in December 2000 and which included the hotel and restaurant sectors among those covered by its scope, found that while less than half of all firms had formal plans for the changeover to the euro at that point, a substantial majority, 72%, had received information on what is involved in the changeover and expressed high levels of satisfaction with the information received.</P>
      <P>To address the issue in the tourism industry, CERT has designed and is delivering a series of workshops at regional locations to help tourism operators identify key issues and to develop phased action plans aimed at addressing these. The workshops are being run for the Restaurants Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation and the Licensed Vintners' Federation. CERT estimates that by June a total of 500 industry personnel will have attended the workshops and that there will be an increase in demand for the programme in the latter half of the year.</P>
      <P>Apart from its own preparations for the introduction of the euro, which include the commencement of staff training in April 2001 and the dual currency display in all print material for 2001, Bord Fáilte has used the opportunity of its regional roadshows to heighten awareness in the industry of the implications of the euro.</P>
      <P>Industry is also playing its part. Last September the Irish Hotels Federation, in conjunction with the Restaurants Association of Ireland, recommended to all members that they should subscribe to the IBEC-EAN Ireland code of practice regarding the changeover. This code, which has been approved by the Director of Consumer Affairs, will provide a framework for self-regulation by the industry with regard to pricing, currency display and conversion and consumer information.</P>
      <P>While I have had no direct discussions with the tourism sector on this subject, I am satisfied that the tourism agencies under the aegis of my Department and the professional associations within the tourism industry are making careful preparations for the introduction of the euro and that they, in co-operation with other organisations such as the Euro Changeover Board, Forfás and IBEC, are doing all possible to exhort and prepare the industry for changeover. It is now up to each individual business to work to ensure it is ready in good time for the changeover.</P>

      <P>There have been no meetings to date of the NSMC in sport sectoral format as sport is not an area specifically referred to in the Good Friday Agreement for North-South co-operation and implementation.</P>
      <P>The funding levels for Tourism Ireland Limited have not yet been formally determined by the NSMC, although it has been decided that a North-South funding balance of 1:2 will apply for the programme costs of the company. The southern contribution to programme costs will be financed out of the tourism marketing fund, B9 of the Department's Estimate, in line with the commitment for tourism marketing funding given under the national development plan, to be supplemented by additional funding from the North. The proposed marketing programmes of TIL will be determined in due course by the board of the company. The objective is that the company will be fully operational for the 2002 season.</P>

      <P>The decision earlier this year by the board of the festival company to defer the original St. Patrick's Day festivities due to the foot and mouth disease crisis was a particular blow, both to the country as a whole and to the tourism industry in particular. The worldwide reaction following the postponement of the parade and celebrations on 17 March demonstrated the value of the St. Patrick's festivities to our image abroad and the vital contribution it makes in the marketing and promotion of tourism to Ireland at the start of the traditional tourist season. For this reason I look forward to the festivit<Col N="952" /> ies in 2002 being held over the weekend of 17 March, as is normal.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the restrictions put in place by the Government to ward off the threat of the foot and mouth disease, and the overwhelming public support for those restrictions, worked so well to achieve that end. As a result it was possible to reschedule the festival and to celebrate it, albeit belatedly, in May. The rescheduled event helped to reassure our tourists, both at home and abroad, that Ireland is now fully open for business, that it is a safe place to visit and that it offers some of the best tourist attractions, festivals and activities to be found anywhere in the world.</P>
      <P>Given the, hopefully, once-off nature of the foot and mouth disease crisis, and the fact that there are many other events to celebrate at this time of year, I do not believe it will be necessary to reschedule festivities from March to May next year.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has committed the Government to target investment under the national development plan on a priority basis to the 25 areas with the greatest concentration of disadvantage in the country. The areas were selected using criteria such as unemployment levels, income levels, family and social structure, educational disadvantage and high levels of rented local authority housing. On this basis no areas in County Kilkenny qualified to be among the 25 most disadvantaged areas here.</P>
      <P>There are many other initiatives which have been put in place by Government to tackle problems associated with social inclusion for which an overall budget of £15 billion has been included in the NDP. Local authorities have also been given a wide social inclusion remit and one of the priority areas for the recently established county-city development boards is to address such matters at local level on an ongoing basis. Furthermore my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is developing a second strand of the RAPID programme targeting provincial towns while the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is developing a programme targeting rural decline entitled CLAR.</P>

      <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, provides funding to voluntary sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level towards the provision of sport and recreational facilities. Under the 2001 programme I have received 1,467 applications requesting total funding of £221.6 million. They are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria which are outlined in the guidelines for the programme. As soon as the assessment of the projects has been completed, I will be in a position to finalise the overall budget for this year's allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past three years, 1998 to 2000 inclusive, this Government has allocated grants to the value of £62 million approximately to in excess of 1,300 projects. Compared with the three year total of £18 million in allocations by the previous Government in the period 1995 to 1997, the commitment of this Government to the provision of funding for sport and recreation facilities nationwide is clear, particularly when consideration is made of other sports facilities funding administered by my Department. These include the local authority swimming pool programme &ndash; under which the Government has provided £45 million funding over the three year period 2000 to 2002, effectively increasing the annual budget from £3 million per annum to £15 million over the period; the national 50 metre swimming pool at the University of Limerick &ndash; currently under construction and due to be opened later this year. The total cost of the pool is £5.95 million. Provision to enable capital grant payments to be made to <Col N="956" /> develop the pool in 2001 is £5.097 million which includes £197,000 towards annual running costs associated with the pool; and sports-campus Ireland &ndash; provision to enable capital payments for campus and stadium Ireland in 2001 is £32 million, consisting of £30 million capital and £2 million current.</P>
    <P>The greatly increased funding for sport provided by this Government has resulted in a considerably enhanced quality and range of top class facilities from national level to local community clubs and centres. The further increase in the sport budget in 2001 to £83 million from a figure of £13.5 million in 1997 will, <i>inter alia</i>, enable me to continue the work of providing a network of high quality, appropriate and sustainable sport and recreation facilities countrywide.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The competition for the stadium and sports facilities, excluding the aquatic and leisure centre, is at the outline bid stage, the closing date for which is 21 June next. Expressions of interest have also been received in relation to the compe<Col N="959" /> tition for the commercial facilities and consideration of these will take place following receipt of the outline bids for the sports facilities. The designing, building, financing, operating and maintaining of the aquatic and leisure centre has been the subject of a separate tendering competition, now complete, and draft heads of agreement have already been signed with the preferred bidder.</P>
    <P>CSID will report back to me, and through me to the Government. An independent cost overview, which is currently being commissioned by my Department, will enable Government to assess the future path of the project, and this report will be considered prior to any decision to enter into contracts with any preferred bidder for the stadium, sporting and commercial facilities.</P>
    <P>CSID announced last week that it had completed a series of constructive meetings with five of the bidders pre-qualified to tender for the contract for the sports facilities, including stadium Ireland, planned for Abbotstown. The five bidders have all indicated that they will be participating in the bidding process.

      <P>The Irish Sports Council, with funding allocated to it by my Department, is working closely with the national governing bodies of sport to help them improve their organisational capacities and structures, to enhance their <Col N="960" /> administrative systems and to introduce more effective planning processes within their organisations.</P>
      <P>The council, based on clear criteria, allocates funding towards the core activities of the governing bodies, including administration, strategic planning, coach education, training and competition. Over the last few years a number of individual governing bodies in sports such as gymnastics, hockey, basketball and athletics have merged resulting in more effective, focused organisations, and the council will continue to facilitate the amalgamation and rationalisation of smaller organisations who consider that their structures and sports would benefit from such mergers.</P>
      <P>The Sports Council is also putting in place measures to improve the development, promotion and co-ordination of sport at local level. It is currently piloting eight local sports partnerships which, with the active involvement of a wide range of statutory and voluntary bodies, including sports organisations and clubs, would help create greater opportunities for participation by all in sport and ensure that resources are utilised and co-ordinated to best effect at local level. In this year's budget, the Government announced that it intends to double the annual budget for the Sports Council over the next four years to £20 million to assist it in its programmes and activities.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the Sports Council has a total budget of £8.5 million available for national governing bodies, which represents a doubling of the national governing bodies budget over the last two years. Under my Department's sports capital programme it is open to sports organisations, clubs and community groups to apply for funding for the provision of sport and recreation facilities. Under last year's programme, I allocated £36 million to some 679 projects throughout the country. I intend to make allocations under this year's programme shortly.</P>

      <P>Since July 1997, out of a total of 394 advertisements placed by the Department in the written media, 111 referred to me in name or title. There is a record of one radio advertisement in which reference was made to me &ndash; Establishment of the Interdepartmental/ Agency Review Group on Public Safety. I did not personally appear or speak in any radio or television adverts placed by the Department. Notices placed in <i>Iris Oifigiúil </i>are not considered as media advertising and thus are not included for the purposes of this response. Neither are advertisements placed by agencies of the Department, as this is considered a day to day matter for the agencies.</P>
      <P>Given the short time scale for the response it has not been possible to isolate the precise costs of the advertisements that contain a reference to me. However, extrapolating from the Department's annual advertising outturn as reported to the Department of Finance, the estimated cost over the four year period was £124,000 or £157,000.</P>
      <P>No instruction issued to the Department's agencies or to companies to include a reference to the Government or myself, unless there was a statutory requirement to do so.</P>

      <P>Weatherdial is updated three times daily, at 6 a.m., 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. As this is a commercial service, any decision to increase the update frequency would have to take into consideration both the demand for such a change and the extra resources required. The current assessment is that an increase in frequency is not called for.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to ensure that updates take place on time. However, technical difficulties and the higher priority attached to the issue of severe weather warnings in extreme situations occasionally result in delays.

      <P>Arrangements for the provision of a taxi service at Dublin Airport, including the issue of permits to taxi operators, are matters for the day to day administration of Aer Rianta in the context of the operation, management and development of the airport. Regulation of the issue of permits to taxi operators derives from section 42 of the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act, 1998 and the Airport Bye-laws 1994 (S.I. No. 425 of 1994). The rationale for the regulation of taxi operations is for the purposes of the proper management, operation and supervision of the airport, and to ensure the effective management of the taxi service.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta informs me that all taxi drivers with a valid taxi plate issued by Dublin Corporation and holding a current public service vehicle badge &ndash; licence &ndash; are eligible to apply for a permit to operate at Dublin Airport. Prior to the national deregulation of the taxi industry approximately 2,000 permits were issued by Aer Rianta for operation at Dublin Airport. Post-deregulation that number has risen to approximately 4,500 permits, i.e. the number of permit holders has more than doubled. Although 4,500 permits have been issued, the number of taxi operators who operate out of Dublin Airport on a regular basis is in the range 1,500 to 2,000. Aer Rianta is still accepting applications for permits.</P>

      <P>It was necessary in the context of the foot and mouth crisis to ask a number of organisations including the Irish Kennel Club to suspend or postpone events. This was the case in respect of the St. Patrick's Day Dog Show which was to take place in the IKC grounds in Cloughran, County Dublin.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to this and to assist the staging of future shows later in the year, a protocol for dogs travelling from the UK for dog shows was developed by the IKC in conjunction with the expert group established by me. This protocol has been in place for some considerable time and will remain in force as long as there is an overhang of risk from foot and mouth disease in Great Britain where further cases are still arising and a degree of uncertainty exists in relation to the situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>However, it is possible to stage dog shows subject to compliance with the relevant protocols in place.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> On 12 April, in accordance with EU procurement procedures and prior to the Government decision of 1 May 2001, to commission an independent overview of the sports campus at Abbotstown, the Commissioners of Public Works placed an advertisement in the EU Journal, seeking expressions of interest from contractors for the construction of new laboratories at Backweston, Celbridge, County Kildare. Similar advertisements followed in the national newspapers, in accordance with standard practice.</P>
    <P>The receipt of expressions of interest will not create any binding or contractual obligations on the state nor will the process cut across, in any way, the independent overview commissioned by the Government.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works has received a report from South Dublin County Council regarding the unprecedented flooding at Lucan in November 2000, which has been estimated to be in excess of a 100 year flood event. The contents of this report, are being reviewed with a view to determining what assistance, if any, Office of Public Works might be able to offer to South Dublin County Council in this matter. In view of the complex matters raised in the report, some of which are outside the functional remit of the Office of Public Works and some of which are being investigated further by the consultants for the local authority, it is not possible at this stage to indicate what action(s) might appropriately be taken to prevent a reoccurrence.</P>

This invoice has not been received by this Department yet. Brindley Advertising Limited hold the current Government advertising contract.

    <P>When advertising a particular scheme or project sponsored by this Department in many cases a reference will be made to the Minister for Finance using the title alone. In a small minority of cases, where this has been recommended by the advertising agency, reference has been made to the Minister by name.</P>
    <P>Under EU regulations, agencies involved in the <Col N="973" /> implementation of EU co-funded measures under the NDP are required to put in place appropriate arrangements to promote the measure and the fact that it is receiving support from EU structural funds. As part of this process, and in order to promote and raise awareness of the measures under the national development plan among potential beneficiaries and the public at large, the Government approved a communications strategy for the NDP which includes the use of an NDP logo and of the EU logo where appropriate. In this regard, the detailed identity guidelines for the National Development Plan Logo, page 2, approved by the Government, require that &lsquo;the phrase &lsquo;Funded by the Irish Government under the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006' must be included prominently in all relevant publicity materials, advertisements, information leaflets and application forms'. Reference to the EU structural funds must also be included where a measure is co-financed by the EU. At this time, my Department has not placed any advertisements in relation to NDP measures and, as such, no such instructions have issued to advertising agencies or companies.</P>

      <P>The issue of the tax treatment of cohabiting couples was discussed most recently in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes. The group, which was established by the Minister for Social Welfare in May 1997, reported in August 1999 &ndash; the report is available from the Government Publications Sales Office. The group was sympathetic, in principle, to changes in the tax legislation to address the issues raised relating to cohabiting couples and reported that the options that it set out should be considered further in the context of budget 2000.</P>
      <P>Since the report was published, I initiated in budget 2000 the process to reform the standard rate income tax band. When the process is complete the position of all couples will be the same with respect to the standard rate tax band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of married couples in relation to income tax is accorded recognition through the married person's tax credit and the home carer's tax credit. I have no plans to change the arrangements in that regard. The working group acknowledged that a key issue in relation to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples is whether tax law <Col N="974" /> should proceed ahead of changes in the general law on the matter. For that reason, and while I am cognisant of the issues faced by cohabiting couples, I have no plans to extend the married person's tax credit to such couples at the present time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 51 of the Finance Act, 2001, provides for the new scheme of capital allowances for expenditure incurred on the cost of taxi licences acquired on or before 21 November 2000. The allowances are effectively backdated with the cost being deemed to have been incurred on 21 November 1997 where the licence was purchased prior to that date.</P>
      <P>The actual cost of the licence can be written off over five years at the rate of 20% per annum. The write-off will be allowed against the trading income only of the licence owner who drives the taxi. However, if additionally, the same vehicle is rented out on a part-time basis, then the cost can be written off against both the trading income and the rental income from the vehicle in question.</P>
      <P>On the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill 2001, I introduced some further refinements to the provision as it then stood and these are now also reflected in section 51 of the Act. The objective was to address certain &lsquo;hardship' cases that had been brought to my attention. Accordingly, section 51 also provides that: where a licence was inherited from a deceased spouse who carried on a taxi trade the licence holder may offset the capital expenditure incurred on the original acquisition of the licence against the rental income from the licence, even if there is no trading income from the licence. This measure will only be available in respect of one licence; in cases where inheritance tax or probate tax was paid in respect of a taxi licence, the value used for such tax purposes may be used instead of the actual capital expenditure cost, if that value is higher.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage I further extended the provisions of section 51 to cater for the situation where a widow or widower, who has inherited the licence from his or her spouse, lets the licence to a third party who provides the associated vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allowances for the tax year are deducted <Col N="975" /> from the profits of the taxi trade for that year. Where the allowances exceed the profits in a year, the excess is carried forward to the following year. Claims for the relief should be made to the individual's tax office. A claim should include the date the licence was acquired, the date the trade commenced and the cost of the licence. If a return of income has already been submitted in respect of any of the years the above details can be forwarded in support of a claim. Otherwise the details should be included with the return of income.</P>
    <P>The value of the tax refund in respect of each of the amounts of expenditure mentioned will depend on a person's marginal rate of tax for each of the five tax years over which the allowance is claimed and the amount of income exposed to tax at that rate. The following table gives the refund of income tax available for the marginal rates of tax 22% and 44%, respectively, for 2000-01. A similar approach would apply for other relevant years up to the total of five years.</P>

    <P>It must be borne in mind that marginal rates of tax will vary with the particular year and the individual's circumstances. These refunds only apply where the full amount of the allowance is relieved at the marginal rate.</P>
    <P>In relation to taxi plate holders being allowed to purchase cars free of vehicle registration tax, VRT &ndash; VRT is an important source of revenue for the Exchequer, especially given this Government's strategy of reducing other taxes &ndash; I have no plans to allow taxi plate holders to purchase cars free of VRT. There is the substantive problem in that any VRT concessions for taxis and hackneys would itself be costly and could lead to further revenue losses in respect of private cars, as vehicles could be passed through the taxi/hackney fleet to avail of any tax concession. VRT is paid on initial registration and does not require the retention of a vehicle for any time period.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>I am committed to addressing the issue of providing an appropriate and structured general practice out of hours service. Accordingly, two major general practitioner out of hours co-ops have been formally established by my Department on a pilot basis in the North-Eastern Health Board and South-Eastern Health Board. Both of these are currently being evaluated and the results of the first stage of the evaluation will be available in late June.</P>
      <P>At that time, I propose to hold a rescheduled national conference on this important subject which will allow all interested parties to have their say on how precisely the out of hours response can best be framed. In that regard, I have to make it clear that the co-op model is only one type of out of hours structure. Other models may well be feasible and even preferable in particular locations throughout the country. For example, in Dublin, DUBDOC already operates from St. James's Hospital as an out of hours GP project.</P>
      <P>From the outset, my Department has made it clear that no further out of hours projects could be formally sanctioned until the pilot evaluations were concluded. This is wholly consistent with a logical approach to ensuring that the matter is effectively and properly addressed from the perspective of ensuring working models that provide quality patient care on an equal basis between urban and rural communities. The process is also intended to be an incremental one with structures being developed strategically throughout the country building on experience gained and the optimum utilisation of resources. The next scheduled operational development is in the Southern Health Board area and that is due to commence this year.</P>
      <P>All health boards received some funding this year to allow them, at the very least, examine the infrastructural and other issues relevant to developing appropriate out of hours structures in their particular areas. The details are set out below:</P>

      <P>The provision of an air ambulance service for emergency cases which cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance continues to be provided by the Air Corps and the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>The possible introduction of a dedicated air ambulance service is being examined at present with a view to developing a policy position in the context of pre-hospital care.</P>
      <P>The Pre-hospital Emergency Care Council PHECC at my request, is presently considering the issue, including the need for targeted research on the use of helicopter emergency medical services. I have received a submission from the PHECC on the nature and extent of the study or research which needs to be carried out in this regard. This submission is currently being examined by my Department. In addition the issue is being examined in the context of North-South co-operation by a working group on emergency planning and pre-hospital care established on foot of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge that an air ambulance service is only one element of an effective emergency medical care system. Since the publication of the report of the review group on the ambulance service in 1993 approximately £45 million has been provided for the implementation of the reports recommendations with well over half this funding being provided by this Government. This has resulted in major improvements in the service including: the training of <Col N="979" /> ambulance personnel; the specification and age profile of the ambulance fleet; the development of command and control centres; the opening of additional ambulance stations; and the provision of training and equipment to general practitioners in remote rural areas, on a pilot basis, to enable them to deal with emergencies in advance of the arrival of an ambulance.</P>
    <P>I remain committed to the continued development of the pre-hospital care system identified both in the review group's findings and in the report of the cardiovascular health strategy group, Building Healthier Hearts. Proposals for the development of an air ambulance service fall to be considered in the wider context of developments in emergency medical services generally. Any initiative in this area needs to complement other pre-hospital services such as the ambulance service, first responder schemes and other emergency response schemes.</P>

      <P>Children aged 16 to 18 years are currently treated by the adult psychiatric services. However the placement of children of this age in adult psychi<Col N="980" /> atric facilities is increasingly seen as inappropriate.</P>
      <P>I established a working group on child and adolescent psychiatry to review services and make recommendations on how these services should be developed in the short, medium and long-term. In its first report, published in March 2001, the group recommended that a total of seven child and adolescent inpatient units for children ranging from six to 16 should be developed throughout the country. A sub-group of the working group is now being established to examine the service needs of persons between 16 and 18 years. This sub-group consists of experts from the fields of adult and child psychiatry and it will examine how the needs of 16 to 18 year olds should be addressed in the context of future service developments.</P>

      <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme commenced in February 2000. BreastCheck has reported that the uptake of invitations to screening is now approaching the target level of at least 70% set by the programme, with current uptake at 66%. It is anticipated that this figure will rise by between 6% to 8% on second invitation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the successful development of the programme is dependent on the availability of highly skilled radiographers being available for screening. Because of a current shortage of suitably skilled radiographers, BreastCheck has taken a number of initiatives to address this issue, including running an international advertising campaign, offering an attractive employment package to suitably qualified radiographers and developing a joint initiative with the school of diagnostic imaging at the Faculty of Medicine, UCD to set up a post graduate diploma in mammographic imaging. BreastCheck has an agreed complement of 16 radiographers and at present have eight full-time equivalent radiographers, which is currently impacting on the programmes ability to screen the targeted number of women per annum. However, as outlined for the Deputy, BreastCheck are actively addressing this issue.</P>
      <P>BreastCheck report that the targets achieved in all other areas are exemplary in comparison with European breast screening programmes in Holland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of my Department that phase two of the programme, which will involve the extension of BreastCheck nationwide, should follow phase 1 as soon as is practicably possible. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice.</P>

In addition, a project team with an experienced Departmental and health board membership is responsible for co-ordinating the work and preparing a final draft of the strategy.</P>
      <P>I have established a series of working groups to make recommendations on key themes that will inform the strategy, such as those relating to funding, eligibility, service delivery and human resources, e-health, health promotion-population health, quality, futures and the interface between voluntary and statutory providers. There are also groups dealing with primary care and the public-private mix of health care services.</P>
      <P>I have initiated a wide-ranging consultation process in relation to the strategy. This involves representatives of all of the key stakeholders in a broadly based National Consultative Forum, as well as targeted consultations with members of the public, staff of the health services, health boards and other agencies. In addition to its deliberations in plenary sessions, the National Consultative Forum has been working in individual sub-groups, advising on the themes that are currently being considered by the working groups.</P>
      <P>The next plenary session of the National Consultative Forum will take place at a special two day meeting on 10 and 11 July. By that stage, I anticipate that the major issues and themes proposed for the new strategy will be ready for consideration by the forum.

The forum was established to facilitate the development of a medical manpower policy relating to improved service delivery for patients in hospitals and enhanced training and career structures for doctors.</P>
      <P>I received the final draft of the report of the Medical Manpower Forum following the final meeting of the forum on 28 November 2000. The report of the Medical Manpower Forum was brought to Government with the report on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors on 27 March 2001 for the consideration of the Government.</P>
      <P>In regard to medical manpower, the Government has noted the recommendations in relation to a consultant delivered public hospital service and will consider these proposals again in the light of the results obtained from a costing study on the matter which is also to be undertaken by the newly established national task force on medical manpower. The Government has also approved the commencement of negotiations with the relevant parties on core issues arising from the report, including flexibility cover arrangements, teamworking, etc.</P>
      <P>The report of the forum on medical manpower sets out proposals for the restructuring of the medical workforce both in the context of changed work patterns and a consultant delivered service. The next stage is to quantify the costs, following which the Government will reconsider the proposals. A detailed quantification of the resource implications will now be undertaken. This assessment will form part of the functions of the national task force.</P>

      <P>In order for any item of medicine to be included in the common list of items reimbursable by the State under the community drug schemes it must comply with a list of criteria. These range from the uses for and licensing of medicines to the pricing of products. One of the criteria stipulates that the product must hold a current product authorisation. In this regard, Eltroxin is the only thyroxine product with a current Irish product authorisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manufacturers of Eltroxin notified this Department of their intention to introduce a 28 pack size in respect of Eltroxin 50mcg and 100mcg as a substitute for the 1,000 pack size. <Col N="985" /> From 1 June 2000, there were no more bulk packs of Eltroxin 50mcg and 100mcg, 100s and 1,000s, available on the Irish market. This method of dispensing is a direct result of a European directive which changed the method of dispensing from a bulk pack to a dispensing patient pack. This directive made it a requirement that all prescriptions must be supplied with a label and a patient information leaflet. The manufacturers of the product have confirmed that, in the main, the increase in price is due to the cost of packaging materials and labour. The pricing is in line with the currency converted UK price from where Eltroxin is imported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Eastern Regional Board Health Authority, ERHA, that the issue of carrying out assessments in the region by social workers from the three adjacent health boards ie South-Eastern Health Board, Midland Health Board and the North-Eastern Health Board was looked into late last year and that none of the boards were in a position to carry out assessments due to their own waiting lists. Voluntary agencies were also contacted and all indicated that they could not help, with the exception of PACT, who agreed with the health board to carry out a limited number of assessments for couples who have an affinity with the Church of Ireland and associated churches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> I am very conscious of the need to reduce time spent by couples on waiting lists for assessment for intercountry adoptions. The number of applications for assessment has been increasing steadily over the last five years. One of the main findings of the report &ldquo;Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures&rdquo; published in July 1999 was the variations in time to complete assessment of couples for intercountry adoption in different health board areas. Over the past three years I have allocated additional funding aimed at reducing time spent on waiting lists by couples awaiting intercountry adoption assessment in all health board areas.</P>
    <P>I understand from the ERHA that the additional funding it received has enabled a number of initiatives to take place that have resulted in a noticeable decline in both the projected waiting time for assessment and a decrease in the numbers waiting to commence assessment.</P>
    <P>These initiatives have included increasing the number of whole time equivalent social workers staff increased from eight at end of March 2000 to 12 at end of December 2000; efforts are being made to employ more social workers for which sanction has been received from my Department; the introduction in January this year of a one-stop-shop facility in Dartmouth House to increase capacity for holding office based interviews and reduce the time that social workers spend travelling to and from client visits; assigning five new administrative personnel in 2000 to provide support for social workers with regard to administrative tasks. This has freed social workers to concentrate on assessments, post placement reports and other appropriate work.</P>
    <P>Last year I launched a standardised framework for assessment that is now being used in all health boards. The purpose is to streamline assessment processes so that resources are used effectively and to provide a transparent system that can be understood by all of the parties.</P>

      <P>Since July 1997 my Department has placed numerous advertisements in the print and broadcast media. They comprise a very wide range; some are placed on foot of a variety of statutory <Col N="987" /> notification requirements, some relate to recruitment issues and some are associated with the day-to-day business, schemes and other activities pursued by my Department and/or offices and agencies under its aegis.</P>
      <P>Long standing practice, which I have continued during my term as Minister, is to include as appropriate, in such advertisements or notices the name and/or title of the Minister or relevant Minister of State.</P>
      <P>Records of this very wide range of advertisements and notices are not in a format that would readily permit, in the time available, compilation of the information sought by the Deputy. Compilation of such information would involve considerable time and work. I am, or my officials are, available to discuss with the Deputy the sheer logistics of engaging in this process.</P>
      <P>I have no recollection of appearing in or speaking on any advertisements on behalf of my Department that were broadcast on radio or television.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to note that under EU Regulations, agencies involved in the implementation of EU cofunded measures under the NDP are required to put in place appropriate arrangements to promote the measure and the fact that it is receiving support from EU Structural funds. As part of this process, and in order to promote and raise awareness of the measures under the NDP among potential beneficiaries and the public at large, the Government approved a communications strategy for the NDP which includes the use of an NDP logo and of the EU logo where appropriate. In this regard, the detailed &ldquo;Identity Guidelines for the National Development Plan Logo&rdquo;, approved by the Government, require that &lsquo;the phrase &ldquo;Funded by the Irish Government under the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006&rdquo; must be included prominently in all relevant publicity materials, advertisements, information leaflets and application forms. Reference to the EU Structural Funds must also be included where a measure is co-financed by the EU. My Department and the agencies operating under its aegis are implementing these guidelines in respect of NDP related measures. I have no information on the specific cost of including the NDP logo and text. However, as the particular advertisements would be placed anyway, the added cost of including the NDP logo would be negligible.</P>

      <Quest>if there is a set of standards or criteria for waiting time in accident and emergency departments in hospitals generally and specifically for the Mater and Beaumont Hospitals; if details of target waiting time can be given for the different degrees of patients; if there is any measurement of actual targets; and if any details of occasional or constant surveys can be given.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16449/01]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Hospitals providing accident and emergency, A&amp;E, services operate a triage system whereby each patient attending an A&amp;E department is assessed and treated in accordance with his/her medical priority. The objective is to ensure that people requiring treatment at A&amp;E departments have access to a senior clinical decision making service and are treated without undue delay.</P>
      <P>As a general rule, the categories of assessment in the eastern region, which includes the Mater and Beaumont Hospitals, are as follows: category 1 &ndash; patient seen by medical staff immediately; category 2 &ndash; condition requires medical attention within ten minutes; category 3 &ndash; condition requires medical attention within one hour; category 4 &ndash; condition requires medical attention within two hours; category 5 &ndash; condition requires medical attention within four hours.</P>
      <P>The majority of patients waiting to be seen but not requiring admission to hospital are in categories 3-5. Details of occasional or constant surveys of target waiting times are not routinely collected by my Department. I have, therefore, asked the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to compile the information requested and to forward it directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It must be stated that levels of attendance at A&amp;E departments are complex and cannot be predicted accurately in advance. In this regard periods of exceptional demand may be experienced and waiting periods for treatment may vary particularly during the winter period. However, I would like to assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to keep waiting times to an absolute minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures which I have taken to improve our A&amp;E services include the provision of a £32 mill<Col N="989" /> ion investment package aimed at alleviating anticipated service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector, over the winter period. The investment package has been targeted at a number of key service areas, including the recruitment of an additional 29 A&amp;E consultants. The recruitment of additional consultants to this key area is designed to reduce any unnecessary delays experienced by patients attending A&amp;E Departments and to ensure that patients have improved access to a prompt senior clinical decision-making service. Additional funding was also provided for the contracting of additional private nursing home places by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards. These places are for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed but who require additional care in an alternative setting. The ERHA and the health boards contracted 761 beds under the initiative and this helped to free up acute beds for patients awaiting admission to hospital.</P>
    <P>I have also provided funding to support a range of further initiatives at hospitals in the eastern region which are designed to improve patient services. These include: funding of £300,000 towards the enhancement of security cover in A&amp;E departments; £5.19 million towards the development of A&amp;E facilities at St. James's Hospital; approval for the recruitment of an additional ten temporary A&amp;E consultants; the provision of a minor injuries unit in Beaumont, Mater, James Connolly Memorial, St James's and Tallaght Hospitals; development of pilot services for deep venous thrombosis in Beaumont Hospital and for chest pain management at St. James's Hospital; the provision of a pilot discharge lounge in Beaumont Hospital; the recruitment of discharge planners at nine adult A&amp;E sites.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks funding of £3 million has also been provided to the Eastern Regional Health Authority for the enhancement of acute hospital services within the region, including the appointment of patient liaison personnel in eight A&amp;E departments across the region.</P>
    <P>I have also requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to review the structure, operation and staffing of A&amp;E services and departments with the aim of improving the provision and quality of patient care. The review, which is now under way, will take into account the report of the Medical Manpower Forum, policies of the Irish Accident &amp; Emergency Association and the Institute of Orthopaedic Surgeons, international best practice, the views of health authorities, management, medical practitioners and other relevant matters. The findings of this review will inform future policy decisions in relation to the development of A&amp;E services. I am satisfied that the initiatives which I have outlined above will help to relieve some of the pressures although I accept that that there is a need for additional targeted investment to the A&amp;E service to allow for future improvement in services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> Finally, I have initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute settings, on foot of the commitment by this Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The bed review, which is at an advanced stage, is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review involves the development of a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors and is specifically examining the need for acute beds on a national basis.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that responsibility for the provision of services to private patients is a matter for each individual hospital, in this case, the Rotunda Hospital. While my Department approves the designation of hospital beds as either public or private and determines the level charge to be levied for private and semi-private accommodation the standard of facilities in private and semi-private units is an issue for the hospital concerned and the private health insurer in the context of providing acceptable standards of accommodation for insured persons.</P>
      <P>The eight major academic teaching hospitals, MATHs, including six hospitals in the eastern region have developed and are introducing an accreditation programme for hospitals. My Department fully supports this initiative and funding of £2.4 million has been made available to date for that purpose. The accreditation programme will formalise standard setting and measurement across many aspects of a hospital's operations. The focus of the standards is on the patient as he/she moves through an episode of care in the hospital. Standards have now been developed around five interrelated functional areas applicable to each participating hospital: patient service groupings; leadership and partnership; information management; environment management; human resource management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Development work on the accreditation scheme is now complete. Irish standards have been drafted, field-tested and approved by the participating hospitals and the national steering group. These standards have also been validated <Col N="991" /> internationally by the International Society for Quality in Healthcare. A team of Irish surveyors has been assembled and trained. The scheme will operate initially in the eight MATH's hospitals and, subsequently, will roll out to other acute hospitals, including maternity hospitals. The first hospital survey is planned for early 2002, with the remaining seven hospitals to be surveyed in the following six months.</P>
    <P>I am bringing proposals to Government with a view to establishing an accreditation body on a formal basis. In the interim, an implementation steering group, ISG, has been established to roll-out the scheme to the participating hospitals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A common list of reimbursable medicines was introduced for the general medical services scheme and the drug payment scheme from 1 July 1999. Previously, medicines which were not available to medical card holders under the general medical services scheme were being reimbursed under the community drugs schemes. The introduction of the common medicines list ensures equity between the general medical services, GMS, and the drugs payment scheme in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State under both schemes. Apart from products delisted in 1982 and routine deletions due to product discontinuations, I am not aware of any products being deleted from the common list of reimbursable items.</P>
      <P>In order for any item to be included in the common medicines list it must comply with certain published criteria. These range from criteria on the uses for and licensing of medicines to the pricing of products. In addition, the product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public. However, if a medical card holder is suffering undue hardship obtaining a medicine which is not covered under the common list, he or she may apply to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board for assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another criterion for reimbursement is that the product must be the subject of a current product authorisation from the Irish Medicines Board <Col N="992" /> with regard to the quality, safety and efficacy of the product.</P>
    <P>The list of drugs, medicines and appliances available to GMS patients, as specified in the current GMS code book, including all updates, and with some additions, forms the common list of items for both the GMS and drugs payment schemes. This common list of items is of course subject to ongoing review and is amended on a monthly basis as new items which conform to the published criteria are added to the list.</P>
    <P>In regard to the specific product referred to by the Deputy, one category of product which is reimbursable is medicinal products authorised and recommended as phosphate-binding agents in the treatment of renal failure in patients on renal dialysis. Should the manufacturer of the product be in possession of the required product authorisation and the marketing of the product is otherwise in compliance with the published criteria, it is a matter for that company to make application to my Department to have the product included.</P>

      <P>The National Car Testing Service, NCTS, is required by the contract with my Department to operate to specific performance standards, including customer service standards. These provide for an average lead time for a test at an individual test centre of less than three weeks with a free test in the case of an individual lead-time that is greater than four weeks. The overall average test lead-time for all test centres must be two weeks or less.</P>
      <P>The test scheduling approach to operations is necessary for the orderly conduct of testing and to support compliance measures. Additionally, it would not be practicable or cost-effective to provide testing on demand on an ongoing basis because of the need to reserve staff and other testing resources to meet unpredictable levels of demand for tests.</P>
      <P>The company recommends that new applicants for taxi licences would make an appointment for a test whenever they are making an application to the licensing authority for a licence. In the case of tests for licence renewals, owners would generally be aware of the renewal date and would consequently be in a position to make timely test arrangements.</P>
      <P>In the event of an urgent requirement for a test, such as in the event of a replacement vehicle following an accident, NCTS will make every effort to accommodate an owner with an early test when it is informed of the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998 requires local authorities in carrying out their statutory assessment of needs, under section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988, to include a separate assessment of the need for caravan sites for Travellers. The need for the provision of sites with limited facilities normally referred to as transient sites, to take account of the annual pattern of movement of Travellers, is therefore seen as an integral part of the provision of Traveller accommodation. No distinction is made between categories of Traveller, such as traders, which may avail of the use of transient sites provided by local authorities.</P>
      <P>Guidelines, prepared in consultation with the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, which were issued by my Department to local authorities on the provision of transient sites recommend that generally such sites should not be designed to cater for more than 20 bays. In light of this it is clear that a co-ordinated approach between adjoining local authorities to the provision of transient sites provides the best means of ensuring that identified needs are met. Any approach that focuses on the provision of transient sites in co-ordinated way is therefore to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1998 Act provided new powers for local authorities to deal with incidents of unauthorised Traveller encampments on public land and on the roadside. Briefly, section 32 of the Act empowers local authorities to act where: an unauthorised <Col N="996" /> temporary dwelling is within five miles of a serviced site provided by any housing authority or voluntary body with the assistance of a housing authority where the dwelling could be accommodated on such site; an unauthorised temporary dwelling is in poor condition or interferes with amenities or is likely to be a risk to personal or public health or safety where the dwelling could be accommodated on another serviced site, an unauthorised temporary dwelling is within one mile of any Traveller accommodation provided by the housing authority or approved voluntary body.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these provisions is to protect residents in Traveller accommodation and those resident in the vicinity of that accommodation. Guidelines have issued to local authorities in relation to these provisions.</P>
    <P>There are other powers available to local authorities such as those available under the Planning Acts in relation to unauthorised development and under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, in relation to the prohibition of temporary dwellings in certain areas. Controls under environmental, litter, public health legislation and the legislation relating to the control of dogs and horses are also available to local authorities to deal with unacceptable behaviour which may arise from the use of temporary dwellings. A local authority's powers to make bye-laws in relation to the use of temporary dwellings under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, have been strengthened under the Local Government Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>Under the Roads Acts vehicles must not be parked in a manner which interferes with the normal flow of traffic or which obstructs or endangers other traffic. The Road Traffic Act, 1961, expressly prohibits the parking of a vehicle in a dangerous manner. Enforcement of these provisions is generally a matter for An Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Committee to Monitor and Co-ordinate the implementation of the Recommendations of the Task Force on the Travelling Community recommends, in its first progress report, that the operation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998 Act should be reviewed in 2002, two years into the delivery of the Traveller accommodation programmes. Any review would, therefore, include the arrangements for the preparation and implementation of all elements of local Traveller accommodation programmes as well as provisions for dealing with unauthorised encampments. Arrangements for carrying out such a review will be considered in due course and will take account of experiences such as those referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The total advertising expenditure in each year is as follows: July 1997-December 1997, £172,676.71; 1998, £197,910.33; 1999, £120,212.80; 2000, £162,392.98; 2001, to date, £71,424.56.</P>

      <P>In order to encourage the provision of cycle lanes, my Department, in association with the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, has published a design manual for cycle facilities entitled, Provision of Cycle Facilities: National Manual for Urban Areas, 1998, which has been circulated to local authorities. The manual was prepared with the assistance of international consultants and reflects good international practice in relation to the provision of quality cycle facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of cycle facilities on non-national roads may be funded from local authorities' own resources or from the discretionary <Col N="999" /> Improvement grant made available by my Department. The discretionary improvement grant allocated in 2001 is £15.111 million which is a 35% increase on the 2000 allocation of £11.192 million and a 48.4% increase on the 1997 provision of £10.18 million.</P>
    <P>Within the greater Dublin area, grants are paid to local authorities by the DTO for specific traffic management projects. An amount of £26.35 million is available to the DTO in 2001 for such projects of which £3.8 million has been allocated for cycle facilities.</P>

      <P>The Cobh landslide programme involves the provision of financial assistance by my Department to Cobh urban district council to undertake remedial works to strengthen areas susceptible to landslips. Consistent with the enabling powers in the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964, the criterion for assistance is that works undertaken must be necessary in order to avert danger to the public. As the reinstatement of private vehicular access does not meet the criterion, it is not possible to provide financial assistance for this work.</P>
      <P>The consulting engineers engaged by the local authority on the landslide programme estimated the road restoration work cost in excess of £430,000 at March 2000.</P>

      <P>Under its contract with my Department, the National Car Testing Service Ltd. operates a formal customer complaints and appeals procedure, which is closely monitored on behalf of my Department. Last year, complaints accounted for 0.17% of all tests, including retests.</P>
      <P>I understand that the case referred to in the question was dealt with by the National Car Testing Service within one day of receiving the complaint and that a refund cheque has issued.</P>
      <P>Road Traffic Regulations made in 1991 made it compulsory from 1 January 1992 for all new cars to have seat belts fitted to the rear seats. It now transpires that certain models of new cars with seating capacity for five adults were sold after that date without a rear middle seat belt and in contravention of the above requirements. In accordance with the National Car Test Regulations, a test certificate cannot be issued in any case where the required seatbelts are not present.</P>
      <P>I am informed that in view of this situation, the importer in question is willing to fit a middle seat belt now at no charge to the car owner in certain circumstances. The person concerned was advised of this by NCTS and a middle seat belt has since been fitted at no charge. The car has now received a NCT certificate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear, BSCF, allowance scheme is designed to assist certain recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year. It is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding individual cases.</P>
      <P>There is no automatic entitlement to the BSCF allowance. A person may qualify for payment of the BSCF allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare, including family income supplement, FIS, or health board payment or participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain prescribed levels. These income levels vary depending on the composition of the household and they are increased each year in line with budgetary increases in weekly social welfare payments. Details of the income limits for 2001 are shown in the following tabular statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> There are special provisions in place which allow people participating in an approved employment scheme to retain their entitlement to the BSCF allowance as long as their household income is less than £250 per week. Also people in low paid employment who are in receipt of FIS are entitled to apply for a BSCF allowance. An estimated 2,500 families in receipt of FIS qualified for the BSCF allowance last year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that I established a working group to undertake a review of the BSCF scheme as part of my Department's series of programme evaluations. The review examined all aspects of the scheme including the rates of payment, the income limits, the means test, time of payment, the eligibility criteria and other issues. I understand that the working group's report is being finalised and I expect to receive the report in the near future.</P>

      <P>The person in question is in receipt of disability benefit at the maximum weekly personal rate of £85.50. His daughter is in receipt of disability allowance at the maximum weekly personal rate of £85.50, while his wife, who is caring for the daughter, is in receipt of carer's allowance at the maximum weekly rate of £88.50. Therefore, the combined weekly income from social welfare payments to this household is £259.50.</P>
      <P>In addition to these weekly payments, the free electricity allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence are being paid to the household. Both the wife and daughter have free travel passes and the husband is also entitled to free travel, when accompanying his wife. An annual respite care grant amounting to £400 will also be paid to the wife on 7 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the husband has been in receipt of disability benefit since October last year and is over 60 years of age, he may qualify for the invalidity <Col N="1005" /> pension. This pension is paid at a higher rate than disability benefit, £89.10 a week. If he qualifies for invalidity pension, he will also be entitled to a free travel pass in his own right. The household may also qualify for the fuel allowance during the winter months. An application form has been issued to the person in question and his entitlement to invalidity pension will be examined on receipt of the completed form.</P>
    <P>A claim for disablement benefit under the occupational injury benefit scheme was received from the person in question on the 14 May 2001. Further details on the accident have been requested from his employer and his claim for this benefit will be considered as soon as the necessary information has been supplied.</P>
    <P>On the wider question of the sufficiency of the levels of social welfare payments, a working group has been established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to examine the range of issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of social welfare payments. In particular, this group is examining the issues involved in developing a benchmark for adequacy of adult and child social welfare payments, including the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing up-rating or indexation of payments, having regard to their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications, in light of trends in economic, demographic and labour market patterns.</P>
    <P>The group, which comprises representatives from each of the pillars of social partnership as well as representatives from the Departments of Finance, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, produced an interim report in April. It is intended that its final report will be published later this year in time to feed into the budgetary process.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability. I am pleased to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that this week the highest ever increases in child benefits are coming <Col N="1006" /> into effect &ndash; an increase of £25 on the lower rate and £30 on the higher rate. In addition, this year the implementation date for payment of the increases has been brought forward by three months.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to child benefit in respect of children who are over 18 years is not contingent on whether their parents are working, as the scheme is neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents.</P>
      <P>In the case of child dependent allowances, CDAs, which are payable with social welfare payments, distinct criteria for entitlement to CDAs apply depending on whether the child is over or under 18 years. Briefly, CDAs are payable in all cases up to the age of 18 years. In addition, where a parent is receiving a pension or other long-term payment from my Department, CDAs are paid up to age 22 where the young person remains in full-time education. In the case of short-term payments, CDAs are only paid up to the age of 18. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Government is committed to extending child dependent allowances to all social welfare recipients where the child is under 22 and in full-time education in the lifetime of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, the wide and extensive range of services, schemes and supports available from my Department requires regular contact with a broad range of voluntary and community organisations working with disadvantaged groups. Funding to support those organisations is provided in a number of different ways. The community development support programme provide funding of £17.2 million this year while the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations provides a further £2.185 million in support this year. In addition, the money advice and budgeting service supports some 50 projects around the country at a cost of £6.66 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department also funds a variety of organisations under its grants scheme for the development of information and welfare rights. Organisations such as the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, the ICTU Centres for the Unemployed and Coolock Community Law Centre benefit under the scheme. Those organisations produce publications on a regular basis which are <Col N="1007" /> primarily designed to disseminate information on social welfare schemes and services to their particular target groups. In that regard, my Department works with the organisations involved to ensure the highest possible standards of information, particularly in relation to accuracy and comprehensiveness. An example is the very successful &ldquo;welfare to work&rdquo; booklet published by the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed with which my Department was closely involved in the preparatory stages.</P>
    <P>Under the back to work and education programmes, my Department funds or co-funds a number of small projects designed to assist unemployed people and lone parents to return to work, education and training and works closely with the organisations involved in providing those services with particular reference to information giving and promotion.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that, in so far as information provision by voluntary and community organisations is concerned, my Department adopts a pro-active approach in ensuring that the funding provided is allocated to its specified purpose and that the information content of social welfare schemes and services meets the highest possible standards.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1999, each planning authority must, for the purpose of protecting structures, or parts of structures, which are of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, include in its development plan a record of protected structures within its functional area.</P>
      <P>This legislation places a duty of care on the owners of protected structures and also gives planning authorities enhanced powers, not only to deal with development proposals affecting them, but also to safeguard their future. This is the proper framework for the protection of our architectural heritage. I am advised that the St. Alphonsus monastery is included in Dublin Corporation's record of protected structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protection afforded under the planning Acts covers both the interior and exterior of the monastery and in the absence of a declaration <Col N="1008" /> from Dublin Corporation, outlining any works which are exempted development, any future building works will require planning permission. Planning applications received by local authorities relating to any protected structure must be forwarded to my Department for observations. I believe that the strength of these provisions will be sufficient to safeguard the architectural integrity of the monastery.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy has noted, the monastery was extensively damaged due to a fire on the night of 19-20 May. An official of my Department visited the location during the outbreak of the fire on 20 May and observed that the chapel and the adjoining hall appear to be the only parts of the building complex to escape the fire, although there may be smoke damage. The question of assessing any proposed restoration is a matter for Dublin Corporation. The cause of the fire is unknown and is the subject of a Garda investigation.</P>

    <P>I have not appeared or spoken in any advertisements. No instructions have been issued to companies or advertising agencies of the nature referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Under EU regulations, agencies involved in the implementation of EU co-funded measures under the NDP are required to put in place appropriate arrangements to promote the measure and the fact that it is receiving support from EU Structural Funds. As part of this process, and in order to promote and raise awareness of the measures under the national development plan among potential beneficiaries and the public at large, the Government approved a communications strategy for the NDP which includes the use of an NDP logo and of the EU logo where appropriate. In this regard, the detailed Identity Guidelines for the National Development Plan Logo approved by the Government, require that the phrase &ldquo;Funded by the Irish Government under the National Development Plan 2000-2006&rdquo; must be included prominently in all relevant publicity materials, advertisements, information leaflets and application forms. Reference to the EU Structural Funds must also be included where a measure is co-financed by the EU. My Department and the agencies under its aegis are implementing these guidelines in respect of NDP related measures.</P>

      <P>On the assumption that the person referred to by the Deputy obtained Irish citizenship through naturalisation, I have set out below the legislative position regarding the naturalisation of the spouse of a naturalised Irish citizen.</P>
      <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956 as amended in 1986, provides that I may, in my absolute discretion, grant a certificate of naturalisation if I am satisfied that the applicant: is of full age; is of good character; has had a period of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and has made, either before a justice of the District Court in open court or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
      <P>Section 16 (d) of the said Act further provides that I may, in my absolute discretion, grant a certificate of naturalisation, although the conditions for naturalisation, or any of them, are not complied with in the case of an applicant who is married to a naturalised Irish citizen. It will be necessary for the spouse to complete the statutory application form and submit some supporting documentation. The application form can be obtained from the citizenship section of my Department.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in Irish immigration law for permanent residency but I understand from officials in the immigration division of my Department that long-term permission to reside in the State as the spouse of an Irish citizen will usually be granted.</P>

      <P>The Sentence Review Group, which was set up initially in 1989, is expected to conclude its work within the next couple of months. The Deputy will be aware that I announced the membership of the parole board last month. It is hoped that the board will be operational in the autumn. In the meantime, premises for the parole board have been provided and are being fitted out, staff are in the process of being provided and I also intend to provide training for members of the board. The board, when operational, will replace the Sentence Review Group. I would like to take this opportunity to place on record my deep appreciation of the dedicated service and invaluable contribution made by all of the members of the Sentence Review Group in advising me and my predecessors on the administration of long-term prison sentences over a 12 year period.</P>
      <P>The outgoing members of the Sentence Review Group are Ms Alice Leahy, Chairperson appointed in March 1996 and founder and director of TRUST, an organisation that works with homeless people; Ms Gisela Whyte, appointed in December 1989 and Secretary of PACE (Prisoners Aid through Community Effort); Mr. Frank Crummey, appointed in March 1996 and is a retired member of An Garda Síochána; Mr. Martin Tansey, appointed an <i>ex officio</i> member of the group in December 1989 and principal probation and welfare officer, probation and welfare service; Dr. Charles Smith, appointed an <i>ex officio</i> member of the group in December 1989 and Medical Director of the Central Mental Hospital; and Mr. John Kenny, appointed an <i>ex officio</i> member of the group in November 1999 and principal officer in the prisons operations division of the Irish Prison Service. All of the current members of the Sentence Review Group reside in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of the new parole board were appointed on 4 April 2001. The parole board is being established on an administrative basis initially pending statutory provision in due course. Appointments have, therefore, also been made on an interim basis pending the enactment of the necessary legislation. The members of the parole board are as follows: Mr. Gordon Holmes, Chairperson, who lives in Limerick and is a senior partner in Holmes O'Malley, Solicitors, Limerick. He is a former State Solicitor for Limerick; Ms Lillian McGovern who lives in Dublin and is the chief executive of Victim Support; Ms Daisy O'Reilly who lives in Roscommon and is a member of the board of management of Harristown House, Castlerea, County Roscommon, an alcohol treatment centre for persons referred to it by the courts; Mr. Tim O'Donoghue who lives in Kerry and is the project manager of the Kerry Diocesan youth service project; and Mr. Frank McCarthy who lives in Cork and is the Governor of Cork Prison. The <i>ex-officio</i> members include Dr. Charles Smith, medical director of the Central Mental Hospital, Mr. Martin Tansey, princi<Col N="1013" /> pal probation and welfare officer, probation and welfare service, Mr. John Kenny, principal officer in the prisons operations division of the Irish Prisons Service and Ms Anne O'Gorman, principal officer in the prisons and probation and welfare policy division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate my Department deals with a wide range of issues and as such would have placed a number of advertisements since July 1997. While some of the advertisements may have contained a reference to me, particularly by title, the Deputy will appreciate that records are not maintained by my Department in a way which would enable the information requested by the Deputy to be made readily available and that the information could only be compiled by diverting substantial staff resources from other important work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under EU regulations, agencies involved in the implementation of EU co-funded measures under the NDP are required to put in place appropriate arrangements to promote the measure and the fact that it is receiving support from EU Structural Funds. As part of this process, and in order to promote and raise awareness of the measures under the national development plan among potential beneficiaries and the public at large, the Government approved a communications strategy for the NDP which includes the use of an NDP logo and of the EU logo where appropriate. In this regard, the detailed &ldquo;Identity Guidelines for the National Development Plan Logo&rdquo;, approved by the Government, require that the phrase &ldquo;Funded by the Irish Government under the National Development Plan 2000 to 2006&rdquo; must be included prominently in all relevant publicity materials, advertisements, information leaflets and application forms. Reference to the EU Structural Funds must also be included where a measure is co-financed by the EU. My Department and the agencies operating under its aegis <Col N="1014" /> are implementing these guidelines in respect of NDP related measures.</P>
    <P>I have no information on the specific cost of including the NDP logo and text. However, as the particular advertisements would be placed anyway, the added cost of including the NDP logo would be negligible.</P>

However, it is a public place within the meaning of the Public Order Act, 1994, and as such is catered for within the policing plan for the city centre. Policing of the boardwalk is specifically covered by Operation Boulevard and a community policing beat. The boardwalk also forms part of normal foot patrols between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 a.m. To date, there have been no major incidents specific to the boardwalk.</P>
      <P>I have also been informed that recently a number of complaints were received about begging and undesirables using the boardwalk. The Garda authorities assure me that the Garda acted swiftly and firmly in response to these complaints and will continue to do so in the future.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 151 on 31 January 2001 concerning the regulations governing the operation of horse drawn carriages in Dublin. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the regulations governing horse drawn carriages in Dublin are the Dublin Carriages Acts, 1853 &ndash; 1855. The following controls are in place: (a) Carriage Drivers: All drivers must be in possession of the following &ndash; carriage drivers licence; carriage drivers badge; and a copy of the Dublin Carriage By-laws 1846 (SI 198 of 1946), (b) Carriage Licences: All carriages must display at all times the following <Col N="1015" />&ndash; carriage licence; Dublin carriage plate; and a plate containing owner's name and address. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that while licensing of the drivers and carriages is a matter for the Garda Commissioner there is no legal obligation to have insurance on these vehicles, nor is it mandatory. The Garda recommend to operators that they should have public liability insurance. The question of insurance relating to vehicles damaged by carriages or injury to persons would be a matter for the parties involved and open to civil suit.</P>
      <P>In relation to the need for compulsory insurance as proposed by the Deputy, the present position is that my Department is in correspondence with the Garda, the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to this matter. I will keep the Deputy informed of developments.</P>
      <P>In relation to the situation in Killarney, I am informed by the Garda authorities that Killarney Urban District Council license the operation of jarveys in Killarney and the Garda have no statutory involvement.</P>

      <P>The feasibility study, &ldquo;A Stadium for the New Century&rdquo;, was commissioned from PricewaterhouseCoopers. A stadium steering committee was appointed to oversee the study. Both the study and details of the composition of the steering committee were placed in the Oireachtas Library in January 2000.</P>
      <P>The Sports Campus Ireland project envisages the development at Abbotstown of a centre of excellence in sporting facilities for a wide range of sports men and women as well as a family destination in its own right, providing a major health and leisure amenity for the local community as well as the general public. Campus and Stadium Ireland Development, CSID, the company established last year to oversee the planning and development of the project, has initiated a tender competition which is seeking bids for the designing, building, financing, operating and maintaining of sports facilities including an 80,000 seat state of the art stadium, aquatic and leisure centre, 15,000-20,000 seat multi-purpose indoor arena, indoor/outdoor training facilities for all sports, tennis centre, golf academy and velodrome.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated previously, the cost of the Sports Campus Ireland project is estimated by CSID at £550 million. This includes the cost of the 80,000 seat stadium as estimated in the PricewaterhouseCoopers feasibility study, &ldquo;A Stadium for the New Century&rdquo;, namely, £230 million. CSID estimate that the private sector will contribute £150 million to the cost of the commercial aspects of the project and a further £50 million has been offered as a private donation. This would leave an exchequer requirement of £350 million.</P>
      <P>These figures are best estimates and it is in order to have the best information possible on the likely cost of the project that the Government has decided to have an independent overview, which is currently being commissioned by my Department. This will be managed by a steering group comprised of the Secretaries General of my own Department, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Second Secretary of the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, provides funding to voluntary sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country towards the provision of sport and recreational facilities. Under the 2001 sports capital programme I have received 1,467 applications requesting total funding of £221.6 million and these are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines for the programme. As soon as the assessment of the projects has been completed, I will be in a position to finalise the overall budget for this year's allocation. Regarding the 2002 sports capital programme, I will be publicly advertising it later this year. My Department's Estimates for 2002 will reflect the estimated level of funding required for grant expenditure in relation to works on approved projects under the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past three years, 1998-2000, this Government has allocated grants to the value of £62 million approximately to in excess of 1,300 projects. Compared with the three-year total of £18 million in allocations by the previous Government in the period 1995 to 1997, the commitment of this Government to the provision of funding for sport and recreation facilities nationwide is clear, <Col N="1019" /> particularly when consideration is made of other sports facilities funding administered by my Department, which include the local authority swimming pool programme, under which the Government has provided £45 million funding over the three year period 2000-02, effectively increasing the annual budget from £3 million per annum to £15 million over these three years; the national 50 metre swimming pool at the University of Limerick currently under construction and due to be opened later this year. The total cost of the pool is £5.95 million. Provision to enable capital grant payments to be made to develop the pool in 2001 is £5.097 million which includes £197,000 towards annual running costs associated with the pool. The only costs projected for 2002 for the pool are for a provision of £202,000 towards running costs; and Sports Campus Ireland &ndash; provision to enable capital payments for Campus and Stadium Ireland in 2001 is £32 million, consisting of £30 million capital and £2 million current. A capital and current provision of £80 million is projected for 2002.</P>
    <P>The greatly increased funding for sport provided by this Government has resulted in a considerably enhanced quality and range of top class facilities from national level to local community clubs and centres. The further increases in funding will enable me to continue the work of providing a network of high quality, appropriate and sustainable sport and recreation facilities countrywide.</P>

      <P>I wish to reply to Questions Nos. 158, 161, 162 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme for 2001 was advertised in mid-December 2000 with a closing date of 9 February 2001 for the receipt of completed applications. In excess of 1,450 applications were received, of which 58 were from County Kildare, including one from the North Kildare Club. All Applications are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines which accompanied the application form for the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>
      <P>Applications to the sports capital programme administered by my Department are classified geographically on a county basis and so it is not possible to provide information for a region within a county. I received 51 applications from County Kildare for the 2000 sports capital programme and 61 applications from the county for the 1999 programme.</P>
      <P>Under the local authority swimming pool programme, I secured £45 million funding for an accelerated programme of investment over the three year period 2000-02 for the refurbishment of existing pools and provision of new pools. Currently, proposals for funding for pools in Naas and Athy are under consideration in my Department.</P>

      <P>The hugely increased investment in sport by the present Government has resulted in a considerably enhanced quality and range of top class facilities from national level to local community clubs and centres.</P>
      <P>In the past three years, 1998-2000, this Government has allocated grants to the value of £62 million approximately to in excess of 1,300 projects for parishes, towns and cities. Compared with the three year total of £18 million in allocations by the previous Government in the period 1995 to 1997, the commitment of this Government to the provision of funding for sport and recreation facilities nationwide is clear.</P>
      <P>The main objectives of the sports capital programme are to develop an integrated and planned approach to the development of sport and recreational facilities; assist voluntary and community organisations with the development of appropriate facilities in appropriate locations that will maximise use in terms of participation in sport and recreation; prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities; and encourage the multi-purpose use of facilities at national, regional and community level by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications under the programme are assessed in accordance with several detailed criteria, which include the following: the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will increase the levels of active participation in sport/recreational sport and/or result in improved standards of sporting performance and how such increases can be measured; the extent to which the project, in terms of growth targets, will serve to increase participation in disadvantaged areas; the financial viability of the project, i.e. in addition to lottery funding, has the club/organisation sufficient funds or firm commitments for funding to complete the project within a realistic time frame the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area as defined by ADM Ltd's indicators and the current and planned levels of sport and/or recreational sport facilities in the area; the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county; the extent to which applicants have consulted with other clubs, community groups, schools and the local authority in developing their proposals and the outcome of these consultations; the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds among different sports and community groups; the <Col N="1022" /> priority of proposed improvements/facilities in relation to the club's or organisation's existing facilities; and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the national governing bodies.</P>
    <P>Applicants are required to consult with other clubs and community groups, including schools with sport and recreational facilities in their area, and with their local authority before making an application for funding and are also requested to show the outcome of such consultations. The purpose of this is to ensure that regard is had to identified needs of the area and that the proposed development does not result in an overlap with and/or duplication of existing facilities.</P>
    <P>Prior to deciding on the funding for national and regional facilities, my Department, in addition to normal assessment criteria, consults with all the national governing bodies of the organisations in question with a view to establishing their present and future priorities. Where appropriate my Department also consults with other Departments, the local authorities and with the Irish Sports Council, in relation to their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>In addition to the sports capital programme, a sum of £85 million has been allocated for the provision of community sporting and recreational facilities under the National Development Plan 2000-06; specifically provided under the culture, recreation and sports measure of the local infrastructure sub-programme of the regional operational programmes of the NDP. The facilities will be located at gateway towns to be identified in the national spatial strategy currently being undertaken by the Department of Environment and Local Government. Once the gateway towns have been identified, proposals will be sought from local authorities and where appropriate voluntary and community organisations for the provision or upgrading of sport and recreational facilities. Work on the identification of regional gateways is scheduled for completion later this year when implementation of the measure can begin.</P>
    <P>In 1999 my Department commissioned ILAM (Ireland), a consultancy firm specialising in sports facilities, to prepare a report on the condition of local authority swimming pools built between 1966 and 1981. Thirty pools around the country were identified as being in need of refurbishment. Under the local authority swimming pool programme, I secured a £45 million funding package for the period 2000-02, an increase in the annual budget from £3 million to £15 million per annum over these years. Grants of up to £3 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost.</P>
    <P>Applicants seeking funding for major sports and recreation facilities under my Department's <Col N="1023" /> sports capital and local authority swimming pool programmes are required to provide a feasibility study setting out detailed assessments on such areas as the types of facilities planned, their potential utilisation, viability, appropriateness to local, regional and national requirements and policy directions and their sustainability over a long period of time.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's overall sports policy, my Department has also committed a grant of £5.95 million towards the construction of the national 50 metre swimming pool in Limerick. Construction of this pool is under way and is expected to be completed later this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to national sports facilities and their role in my Department's integrated sports policy, Sports Campus Ireland will, of course, cater for a large number of sports, providing a range of top-class facilities for their training and competitive needs.</P>

      <P>Until the end of 2000 an educational psychologist employed by my Department in the national educational psychological service, NEPS provided a psychological service to all post-primary schools in County Cavan. This psychologist also had responsibilities in County Dublin. The area based partnership in Cavan also employed a psychologist to serve approximately 2,000 pupils in the county.</P>
      <P>The new NEPS agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 with the 42 psychologists already employed in the service. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of a competition through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions there are now 82 psychologists in NEPS and by the end of this school year there will be 100 psychologists in the service. I also intend to proceed with the recruitment of a further 28 psychologists before the end of this calendar year. This will raise the staffing to 128 and greatly improve the service. This has allowed NEPS to enhance considerably the psychological service in the north-eastern region.</P>
      <P>Two NEPS psychologists have recently been assigned to join the Cavan team and are based in Cavan town. They are continuing the service to post-primary schools and have taken responsibility for the schools previously served by the Cavan partnership. By June 2001, NEPS will be offering a psychological service to 27 primary schools in County Cavan. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to include schools in the Belturbet area in the current phase of expansion but this area will be included in the next phase.</P>
      <P>When primary schools in the county have access to the NEPS service there will be five psychologists serving Counties Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of the case referred to by the Deputy. However, I am mindful of the difficulties that have been experienced in gaining access to psychological assessments in urgent cases, pending the appointment of the full quota of psychologists for NEPS. I have recently announced funding of IR£1.25 million for an important new initiative aimed at addressing these difficulties. NEPS will be communicating details of the new scheme to all schools in June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of requests by voluntary secondary schools for increased funding. The funding arrangements for our post-primary schools have evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and reflect the sectoral division of our second level system.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial assistance in secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978/79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. This scheme is being phased out, as posts become vacant. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional per-capita grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard per capita grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme by its nature is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial services are provided. Secretaries employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
      <P>I have already made it clear in the House that I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post-primary schools and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach. The recommendations made in the steering group's report for the future funding arrangements of second-level schools are under review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels.</P>
      <P>Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am conscious of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, and I am committed to bring greater equity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. The introduction of this support fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants as to how this additional funding is best <Col N="1027" /> utilised in the interests of their pupils. In addition, schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard per capita grant. I increased the grant to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity raised by the voluntary secondary schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978/79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries in primary and secondary schools, and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. However, this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are created. It has been superseded in the PESP agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary and secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. These grants are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grants. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the additional <i>per capita</i> grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme by its nature is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. Secretaries and caretakers employed by schools are employees of the individual schools and my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
      <P>At primary level, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. These improvements mean that for the first time all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, in addition to the funding arrangements outlined above, schools now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil, with a minimum payment of £4,000 per <Col N="1031" /> school under the school services support fund. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to second level schools each year. Provision for secretarial and caretaking support is a particular focus of this fund. The introduction of this additional annual funding is a significant contribution towards enabling schools to meet their commitments.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, officials from my Department are currently in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the phasing out of community employment schemes in schools. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as CE schemes in schools are phased out, funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes would be made available to my Department, thereby ensuring an equitable and uniform system of funding for such services.</P>

      <P>The home-school community liaison scheme was established in 1990 and is a key element in my Department's strategy to combat educational disadvantage. Under this scheme, co-ordinators are assigned to schools in disadvantaged areas to work with school staff, parents and relevant community agencies in advancing the educational interests of children. A national co-ordinator oversees the day-to-day operation of the scheme and promotes its development with the help of two assistant national co-ordinators.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 176 co-ordinators serving the 311 primary schools that are included in the home school community liaison scheme. Of these, 57 primary schools have their own co-ordinators and the remaining 254 schools share co-ordinators with other schools.</P>
      <P>The home-school community liaison scheme was last expanded in September 1999. This expansion included any remaining schools designated as disadvantaged that did not have a home-school community liaison service. There are no plans at present to further expand the home-school community liaison scheme at primary level.</P>
      <P>At second level, 211 second level schools that are designated as disadvantaged have been invited to participate in home-school community liaison scheme and have been allocated additional teaching resources to facilitate their participation. There are no plans at present to further extend the home-school community liaison scheme at second level.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</P>
      <P>The enrolment at the school in question has decreased from 367 pupils on 30 September 1999 to 350 pupils on 30 September 2000. This latter enrolment will entitle the school to a staffing of a principal and 12 mainstream class teachers for the 2001-02 school year. In addition, the school has a learning support teacher.</P>
      <P>The only deviation from the agreed schedule to which I referred is in the case of schools that are experiencing a large increase in enrolments. In such cases an additional staffing post may be sanctioned by my Department if the school meets the defined criteria.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, at this time, it is not possible to sanction the retention of the 13th mainstream teaching post for the school year 2001-02 as the school's September 2000 enrolment does not meet the retention requirement of 360 pupils.</P>

      <P>The reckonable income limits, for the purpose of the award of a maintenance grant in respect of the 2001-02 academic year are not as yet available.</P>
      <P>The practice of recent years has been to increase the reckonable income limits at least in line with movements in the average industrial wage and to increase third level maintenance grants at least in line with inflation.</P>
      <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants and other student supports to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review, which is at present in progress, is wide ranging and covers many topics. These include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation.</P>
      <P>Some of these topics are, of their nature, complex and require detailed research. For example, costings of the effect of changes in the income limits below which applicants become eligible for a grant have been commissioned and carried out for the special review. Notwithstanding this, however, I expect that the review will be completed in the near future.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>

    <P>There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period 2000 to 2006, aimed at tackling under-representation by students from disadvantaged backgrounds; mature students and students with disabilities in third level education. <Col N="1034" /> The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries while improving their long-term employability.</P>
    <P>Last September, I established the action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from the three target groups. I have received the report of the group and I am at present considering its recommendations. The action group's report contains recommendations on the eligibility criteria governing the category of students who should qualify for the special rate of grant, which I announced last September, and on the appropriate rates to be paid. My Department is finalising the administrative arrangements necessary to ensure that the special rates of grant will be made available as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The special rates of maintenance grant will be applied retrospectively to qualifying grant holders with effect from the 2000-01 academic year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The educational needs of primary pupils with specific learning disability, dyslexia, are generally capable of being met within the mainstream school system with the assistance where appropriate of a remedial teacher. There are currently 1,480 remedial teachers in place in the primary sector.</P>
      <P>Children of primary school age whose condition is of a more serious nature may attend their local primary school where they can be supported by the special resource teacher service. There are now 689 full time resource teachers allocated to support children with special needs, including those with specific learning disability.</P>
      <P>For some children, the severity of their condition can be such that placement in a special school or in a special class attached to a mainstream school is the required response. There are four such special schools and 19 such special classes in place at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is continuing to support the work carried out by the Dyslexia Association of Ireland to assist in providing support for the <Col N="1035" /> classes that they provide outside school hours. An allocation of £50,000 was made in both 1999 and 2000 to support their services. A similar level of funding will be made available in the current year. A further sum of £14,000 was also allocated in the last school year to assist CHILD, the Limerick based organisation established to provide care and help for individuals with learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>In past years, psychological assessment of national school children, including those suspected of having dyslexia, has been the responsibility of psychologists employed by the health boards and by voluntary agencies under their aegis. The new NEPS agency came into existence on 1 September 1999 with the 42 psychologists already employed in the service. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of a competition through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions there are now 82 psychologists in NEPS and by the end of this school year there will be 100 psychologists in the service. I also intend to proceed with the recruitment of a further 28 psy<Col N="1036" /> chologists before the end of this calendar year. This will raise the staffing to 128 and greatly improve the service.</P>
    <P>In those schools served by NEPS, an important part of the psychologist's work is to assist principals and teachers to develop procedures for identifying and prioritising those students who are most in need of help. I am aware of the difficulties experienced by schools in gaining access to psychological assessments in urgent cases, pending the appointment of the full quota of psychologists in NEPS. I have recently announced funding of IR£1.25 million for an important new initiative aimed at addressing those difficulties. NEPS will be communicating details of the new scheme to all schools in June.</P>
    <P>Resource teaching posts are sanctioned to schools either on a full or part-time basis depending on the assessed level of need. My Department has sanctioned two resource teaching posts for the area referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>In October 2000, I established a task force on dyslexia to examine provision for children with dyslexia. I understand that this task force has now completed its deliberations and I look forward to receiving this report in the very near future.</P>
