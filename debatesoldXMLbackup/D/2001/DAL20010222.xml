      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the need to establish a code of discipline for the Judiciary given the reported comments of a judge who implied that it is permissible for a man to beat a woman without fear of sanction. The judge also commented on the use of alcohol when a man &ldquo;drinks like a man&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 22 shall be decided without debate and that the proceedings on Second Stage of No. 5 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 2.30 p.m. and that any division demanded thereon shall be postponed until immediately before the Order of Business on Tuesday, 27 February 2001. It is further proposed that the proceedings on No. 49<i>a</i>, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. and that the following arrangements shall apply: the opening statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for Fine Gael and the Labour Party shall not exceed ten minutes in each case, the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes, and Members may share time.</P>

      <P>No, Sir. Yesterday I asked the Tánaiste if the Taoiseach would be prepared to make a statement to the House on the circumstances surrounding the resignation of the former Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe. I am surprised that provision is not made for this on today's Order Paper. Has the Tánaiste conveyed my request to the Taoiseach and, if so, why is the Taoiseach not present? </P>

      <P>There is a contradiction between Deputy Ned O'Keeffe's version of his resignation and that given by the Taoiseach to the House. That contradiction can only be explained by the <Col N="268" /> Taoiseach by making a formal statement and taking questions from the Opposition. This matter will not go away. We will continue to raise it on the Order of Business until the Taoiseach comes into the House to which he is accountable. He will not dodge this issue in the way he has dodged so many others. We have seen it with respect to Deputies Burke, Lawlor and others.</P>

      <P>We should not make light of such matters. The Deputies have tabled questions for next week. I have not discussed with him the remarks made at yesterday's Order of Business. The outcome is the important thing &ndash; Deputy O'Keeffe is not the Minister of State with responsibility for food safety. That was sought by Deputies Quinn and Noonan. They are not satisfied with that.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Sargent's concerns, but I have other concerns that perhaps the Tánaiste could accommodate. There will be no reality to the debate unless the remit is widened to include statements on the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. In the interests of the relevance we are trying to establish in the Dáil, perhaps the Whips could modify No. 49<i>a</i> by agreement during the morning? This would enable the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to inform the House of the up-to-date position on the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise with the Tánaiste the issue of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom, the consequences of which could be devastating for our industry. I wish to raise two issues and suggest a possible way forward. I understand the original source of the infection has not been established, but that there are indications as to its source. Other than the United Kingdom, does the Government have in mind the banning of the importation of food products from certain third countries? Will the Tánaiste bring us up to date on the Northern Ireland registered lorry which visited the abattoir where the original outbreak occurred, which on its return to Northern Ireland was loaded with sheep which were delivered south of the Border in County Cavan? Has there been full tracing? Has everything which can be done been done? It is impossible to seal the Border in the way it was sealed when there was a major outbreak of the disease in the United Kingdom a generation ago. We should, therefore, adopt an all-island approach. The best strategy is to proceed, with the co-operation of the Northern authorities, on an all-island basis to prevent importation through ports, North and South.</P>
      <P>I draw to the Tánaiste's attention the strand two arrangements of the Good Friday Agreement, the North-South Ministerial Council. The Agreement states that the Council should make its best endeavours to reach agreement on the adoption of common policies in areas within the competence of both Administrations where this would be of mutual benefit. If there was ever a situation which jumped from the pages of the Agreement which fulfilled that mandate, it was the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.</P>
      <P>I refer the Tánaiste to the annex to strand two which specifies that the areas for North-South co-operation and implementation may include agriculture, and animal and plant health. I understand preliminary announcements have been made about establishing, under the Council, one of the modules in Cork to deal with food safety and animal health. An all-Ireland strategy should be adopted within the ambit of strand two of the Good Friday Agreement. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should be instructed to make immediate contact with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Bríd Rodgers, MLA, with a view to putting in place an all-island strategy to ensure the agriculture industry, North and South, is protected.</P>
      <P>It is impossible in modern times to stop the virus from crossing the Border. Viruses do not respect political boundaries. This is an infectious disease which can be transmitted by air for 60 kilometres over land and 300 kilometres over sea. I advocate strongly that the Tánaiste use the Good Friday Agreement to place a cordon around ports, North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support and endorse the comments of Deputy Noonan, particularly his call for the adoption of an all-Ireland approach. I am sure the SDLP Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Bríd Rodgers, MLA, would be sympathetic to such an approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an infectious disease which has the potential to cause serious damage to agricultural production. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has been in touch with the authorities in Northern Ireland and London and he will respond in the debate scheduled at the good suggestion made by Deputies Noonan and Quinn. This issue should be approached on an all-island basis. Even in difficult times it was possible to have an all-island approach in the area of agriculture.</P>
      <P>It is not clear whether the vehicle in question which is under examination, crossed the Border and visited a premises in Virginia, County Cavan. That premises has been restricted as a precautionary measure and is under observation. The Minister will deal with the specific detail of that in the debate. It is important we take precautionary steps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste revert to one of my original questions? Reports in the British newspapers suggest the virus is of Asiatic origin and that it may have entered the United Kingdom through an EU country. I understand significant quantities of meat are imported into Ireland from Asia and I would like clarification of the policy position in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on a possible ban on imports from countries in which the virus may have been originally sourced, in addition to the ban applied to the importation of UK meat and food products.</P>

      <P>I urge Opposition Deputies to participate in an all-party process if they really want to resolve this issue as opposed to playing politics with it.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Quinn's question, I will discuss his letter with the Taoiseach. The matter has been dealt with on the Order of Business on a number of occasions. I do not believe there is a conflict of interest between the role of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, in his party and his role as Minister. If that were the case and one had any role in a political party, one probably could not serve in any ministry. I am sure the Taoiseach will respond to Deputy Quinn in writing if that is what the Deputy wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for her reply. The Taoiseach stated on a number of occasions that he will respond. However, there is a precedent irrespective of the content of the letter. It is not acceptable for the Taoiseach not to reply to correspondence from the leader of an Opposition party. It is bad practice and bad manners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <P>That concludes the leaders' questions. I point out that these are for brief questions. Owing to the nature of the first <Col N="277" /> subject, the Chair was tolerant and allowed an unusually long time for it. Normally the questions would be brief. I will now take relevant questions on the Order of Business on promised legislation.</P>

        <b>:</b> In recent months, we have expressed concern that the country is facing a major electricity crisis. A newspaper report today carries details of a confidential Government report which predicts that we are about to have a major power collapse on the same scale as that in California. We are on the brink of an economic catastrophe, in terms of generating and transmission capacity. Deputy Naughten referred earlier to two Bills, namely the Electricity Bill to give effect to the restructuring of the electricity industry and the Gas Regulation Bill to give effect to the restructuring of the natural gas industry. The Tánaiste said those Bills would be published in 2002. That is hopelessly inadequate and much too late. The delay will put paid to Ireland's aspirations to be the e-commerce capital of the world. Why is this matter not being treated with greater urgency? Why is the legislation not being front-loaded? We are not facing up to the crisis which is imminent.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It is generally agreed that Ireland is now one of the wealthiest countries in the European Union. Our position relative to other countries has changed dramatically over the past 10 years. We now have an unprecedented opportunity to genuinely share the wealth which <Col N="284" /> our economy has produced under successive Governments. I regret the economic benefits which we now enjoy are not shared equally by all sectors of society.</P>
      <P>Although a certain degree of cynicism attaches to the political process, we can point to many successful policies with which all political parties have been associated in recent years. Developments in Northern Ireland illustrate the value of the political process particularly well.</P>
      <P>The recent transformation of the Irish economy and the availability of new resources, also has its origin in politics. We need to set a new national objective to completely eradicate poverty here over the next five years. People are concerned about the widening gap in our society.</P>
      <P>The measures outlined in the Social Welfare Bill will do nothing to lift families out of the poverty trap. The measures put forward by the Government are simply &ldquo;more of the same.&rdquo;  The improvements in social welfare payments are small in the context of a budget surplus of £3.990 billion. This highlights the mean-spirited and fundamentally conservative approach of this Government. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and senior Ministers have been telling old age pensioners that their pensions will increase over the next two or three years. It was most insensitive to tell people that they will get £100 per week if they live for another while. This approach does no credit to any Government.</P>
      <P>The social welfare increases in the budget of last December have not adequately compensated people on social welfare benefits for the effects of inflation. Whenever such payments are increased, local authority rents are immediately increased also. If the Government is serious about helping people on social welfare benefits, such increases in local authority rents should not automatically follow. Under present arrangements, local authorities have no choice but to increase the rent, because it is based on income. I call on the Government to change that situation immediately, so that local authority tenants will not have their social welfare payments eroded by rent increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will also refer to the carers' allowance. I know of a lady who spends four to five hours daily caring for her mother who has the required medical certification, and her father, who is not so certified. The Department of Social Welfare decided that the lady would need to spend seven or eight hours per day on caring duties for her mother, in order to qualify for the allowance under present guidelines. That would amount to some 56 hours per week. I reminded the Department officials that this person is a human being, not a machine. I now call on the Minister and the Department to introduce a humane set of regulations for the carers' allowance. The scheme should make allowance for situations where carers do not live with their elderly parents and have to travel some distance to care for them. These people are not intent on defrauding the Department, they are merely trying to cater for their needs and those <Col N="285" /> of their families. If the Department is adopting the type of approach to which I refer, particularly in light of our booming economy, it is a sad development. I am disgusted about the treatment received by the person to whom I referred. The case is currently under appeal and I hope that appeal is successful. If not, I will raise the matter again in the House.</P>
    <P>Another issue of concern to me is that of free travel. In most rural areas there is no transport available for people with free travel passes. The Department should introduce a system where elderly people, particularly those who must travel to nearby towns to collect their pensions, etc., can avail of transport, for example, taxis or some other form of public transport. There is no point in having a free travel pass when there is no method of transport of which to avail. The Minister should reconsider the position which obtains in rural areas in particular because there is no transport available to elderly people who are obliged to travel to nearby towns to collect their pensions and do their weekly shopping. People in the private sector should be encouraged to provide transport in rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first time in the history of the State we have a great opportunity to honour the social contract. The budget went some way towards doing so but it did not honour in full the commitments that had been given to various organisations before its introduction in respect of social welfare rates of payment, etc.</P>
      <P>There are more people living in relative income poverty today than there were ten years ago. Ireland has a worse rich-poor gap than any other EU country. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, became very excited when describing what he has done to bridge that gap but he exaggerated somewhat. He should reconsider the position and look at how policies in recent years have widened the gap between the rich and the poor. Everyone agrees with tax reductions and rewarding people at work, but we must ensure there is a balance for people at the other end of the scale. That balance has not yet been introduced.</P>
      <P>Ireland spends a lower proportion of GNP on social welfare than any other EU country. Its contribution is 17.5% of GDP compared to an EU average of 28.2%. At his first press conference as leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Noonan emphasised the differences between the Berlin and Boston models. He pointed out that America is a nice place to live but that the social welfare benefits on offer there do not compare with those paid out by some of our European partners. We must try to achieve that European social model as soon as possible, otherwise people in Ireland will become disaffected and there will be glaring gaps between the rich and poor in society. As already stated, we have a great opportunity to do something for everyone living in Ireland. That opportunity never arose in the past due to lack of resources but, now that it exists, we must take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> In considering the social contract, there are a number of factors which must be taken into account. For example, the housing waiting lists include many people who are in receipt of various forms of assistance. There are now 50,000 on the lists and that number is continually increasing because of the high cost of housing and people's inability to purchase houses because they cannot afford to do so or they cannot obtain a loan.</P>
    <P>There is then the problem of young people who do not have any qualifications. The most recent OECD report indicated that 26% of young people in Ireland under 17 years of age do not possess useful qualifications and that almost one in five 18 year olds are not in full-time education. These figures were also presented to us in many pre-budget submissions by organisations such as CORI and others which provide extremely accurate information in respect of the qualifications deficit.</P>
    <P>When one considers the third factor, namely the number of people on hospital waiting lists &ndash; approximately 30,000 &ndash; one realises this country will face major difficulties in the future. The direction suggested by Deputy Noonan will be embraced by the people. We must have a social contract. People who paid out money in the past in order to provide services in the future, when they will be old and vulnerable, must be rewarded. As far as I am concerned, the budget has not met the expectations of several groups of people throughout the country.</P>

      <P>What about the £5 billion pension fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should allow me to conclude. However, I am glad he is listening to my contribution and reacting to it. The £5 billion pension fund was squandered in the past.</P>
      <P>The Government decided to raise social welfare payments, for example, by only £8 per week, an increase the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs lauded, whereas the commitment given in the PPF was for a £14 per week increase. I understand the cost of increasing payments for everyone on social welfare by £14 instead of £8 would have been £150 million. I have no objection to decreasing the amount paid by people on the top rate of tax &ndash; that includes Members of this House &ndash; but a balance should have been introduced in respect of people on social welfare. What the budget has done is widened the gap between rich and poor. The relevant figures, which speak volumes, show that this is the case. The poorest people could have had their social welfare payments increased by £14 per week for a single person and by £24 for a couple for less than it would cost to reduce the top tax rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we provide increases for one section of the community, we should try to counter-balance matters by providing proportional increases to the other section. In the past there may, perhaps, <Col N="287" /> have been an opposite balance when we took too much in tax from wage earners and provided too much in the way of benefits to the poorer sections. Now, however, we have the ideal opportunity to get the balance right and bridge the gap.</P>
    <P>A number of people on blind pensions contacted me &ndash; perhaps the officials from the Department will bring this matter to the Minister's attention &ndash; because they believed the rate of blind pension should be linked to that which obtains in respect of the old age pension. I understand this would mean little in terms of costs, etc., and consideration should certainly be given to creating such a link. Blind people are very vulnerable. Members will know people who are blind and will be aware that they live a precarious existence. They worry continuously about their safety and welfare. They need someone to look after them. They are vulnerable. The extra few pounds they would receive if they were on the same rate as old age pensioners would help. Perhaps the officials will bring this to the attention of the Minister. I will await his response.</P>
    <P>The linking of social welfare payments with forestry premium payments should be of interest to the Deputies on the other side of the House. When I was in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, in order to get the REP scheme off the ground, I proposed that the first £2,000 of payments should be exempt when assessing means for social welfare. There are large tracts of land owned by old age pensioners and other recipients of social welfare. I am particularly concerned about old age pensioners because that age group still has an affinity with the land and wants to hold on to it and, in some cases, is reluctant even to lease it. Such land would be ideal for forestry, but when it is explained to pensioners that any premium they receive will be deducted from their pension, they refuse to put their land under forestry because they do not want such payments to interfere with their pension rights or security. I ask the officials to bring this to the attention of the Minister. If the first £2,000 of forestry premium payments was exempt from assessment of means, considerably more land could be put into productive use. There is no reason the precedent set in terms of REPs payments could not be applied to forestry premium payments. It is an important issue. I have discussed it with the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Hugh Byrne, who has responsibility for forestry, and he is enthusiastic about it.</P>
    <P>The CORI Justice Commission's critique of the budget provided us with a good assessment of the budget when it stated that the poorest people in society had been betrayed by budget 2001, that it had increased the divisions in society and that when political leadership was required in order that everyone would benefit from the country's new-found prosperity and would be treated with fairness, the Government chose instead to refuse <Col N="288" /> to hear the cry of the poor. That just about sums up the budget. If the Minister has an opportunity to introduce one more budget, I hope he will rectify the imbalances and injustices he has created in this one. I hope he does not get that opportunity and that someone like Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, or even myself, will get the opportunity to undo the damage that has been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Moloney.</P>
      <P>We have all been making our annual pilgrimage to speak on the Social Welfare Bill for some time, in some cases for over 20 years. When I compare this year's Social Welfare Bill with those of earlier years, I realise how much Governments have been able to do to help people who, through no fault of their own, are dependent on social welfare payments. The benefits of the Celtic tiger in putting more people to work mean greater availability of funding for social welfare. In 1990, the amount spent on social welfare amounted to 5% of the budget; this year it is 10.3%. The reduction in the number of recipients between 1989 and 2000 has meant extra people contributing daily. Those people have a right to expect that when they retire there will be sufficient funds in the kitty to secure their pensions. For this reason the Government's action last year in placing £5 billion in the welfare funds for the future was the proper action to take.</P>
      <P>The increases provided for in the Social Welfare Bill, 2001, include an increase in child benefit from £30 per month for the first two children in 1997 to £67.50 in 2001, an increase of £37.50 a month per family. That comes to over £400 a year for a family with two children. Despite the increases, many are of the view that we will have to give more, because the cost of rearing children, in terms of education and everything else, means that parents' costs will continually increase. I agree.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised that the number of people entitled to carer's benefit has been doubled. We must, however, be realistic and acknowledge that there are still many people outside the net who should be included. I have said openly on numerous occasions that a non means-tested payment of £50 to £60 a week should be paid to every carer. In the long-term this would result in a saving for the State in terms of the cost of hospital or nursing home care because, in many cases, it could mean being able to afford to stay at home and look after an elderly parent or relative rather than going to work. That is an issue that should be looked at for the future. I hope that, in the context of the next Social Welfare Bill, something will be done about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many do not realise that it is only because of the reduction in the number of people who are unemployed that so much money is available for social welfare, particularly old age pensions. <Col N="289" /> Some on the Opposition benches laughed when the idea of increasing old age pension to £100 a week was mentioned some years ago. They said that it was an ideal and aspirational, but that the Government would never deliver it. The Government has now done it by granting a £10 a week increase in this year's Social Welfare and Finance Bills. That is a major move. Contributory pensioners and their spouses are entitled to an increase of £25 per week, bringing their weekly rate to £185.60. That is evidence that significant progress has been made in looking after our elderly.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare system has been criticised. Recently I was part of a British-Irish delegation to review the position on social welfare in the United Kingdom. When we compared the benefits available here with those available in the United Kingdom, we realised that we were a long way ahead. That is the reason people born here, but who now live in the United Kingdom want to latch on to some of those benefits. I hope we will be able to facilitate them in terms of free travel and otherwise because, as far as I am aware, being EU pensioners they may have such a right.</P>
    <P>Other social welfare payments have also been increased. There is an increase of £8 per week in disability allowance. Perhaps we should examine if welfare recipients might receive the same increase, irrespective of their category. While there is an excellent increase provided for widows this year, they still do not receive the same increase as old age pensioners. That should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>When considering the future of social welfare it might be worthwhile advising people that, although they will have their social welfare entitlements, they should consider a small private pension plan if they have surplus cash available. Retired local authority workers, for example, receive a small pension on top of their ordinary entitlements. It might be as little as £20 or £30 per week, but that is a help and it would not have cost them an enormous amount of money during their working lives. People should be advised on what they can do to arrange private pensions as well as State pensions.</P>
    <P>We should take another look at <i>pro rata</i> pensions. Last year the Minister made an enormous leap by introducing a <i>pro rata</i> system for those who did not have the required contributions to be entitled to pensions. That was much appreciated by the beneficiaries of those reduced pensions.</P>
    <P>Our welfare payments have grown to a huge extent due to the fact that fewer people are social welfare recipients. That is the reason money is available. Approximately 10% of the national budget is devoted to social welfare. This demonstrates the concern of all Members to protect the most vulnerable in society, those dependent on social welfare. They always have been and always will be our most vulnerable. In providing for them we must ensure that if there is a downturn in the economy and the numbers of unemployed <Col N="290" /> increase, the State will be in a position to fund the benefits they will need to maintain themselves properly.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bills introduced by the Minister on behalf of the Government have done an enormous amount to relieve poverty. We will only have relieved the entire poverty problem, however, when we can take into the system the young people who remain on our streets at night, who do not want to use the welfare system, but prefer to sleep rough. I hope special provisions will be made with regard to taking these young people off the streets and helping those who have hit hard times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for sharing time and allowing me to express my support for the Social Welfare Bill. The Bill addresses issues outlined in the 1997 programme for Government, such as maternity benefit, child benefit, family income support, disability allowance and so forth. These have been tackled in the last four Social Welfare Bills.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. All sides of the House should welcome the fact that the poorest in society will share the benefits of the continuing economic boom. The Bill demonstrates the Government's continued recognition of the fact that those who most need assistance with the living and other expenses of daily life will receive adequate allowances. The Bill pins that down.</P>
      <P>I am particularly happy with the pension provisions. Again, the Government gave commitments in this regard in the programme for Government and I am delighted they are being given effect in the Bill. The Bill gives recognition to the citizens who have contributed so much over many years. We often pay lip-service to what they did, but when this country did not enjoy the economic success of today, these people were putting in the effort. These increases are a welcome recognition of their input.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the extension of maternity benefit from 14 to 18 weeks and, importantly, that adoptive parents will see their benefit increase to 14 weeks. There has been an ongoing campaign to extend maternity benefit and this change is recognition of the submissions made to the Minister and Deputies on all sides. I hope the Minister will significantly increase the duration of these benefits in time.</P>
      <P>The Bill begins to address in a serious way the position of those who provide an invaluable caring service for their loved ones. In recent weeks and before the Budget Statement we met many of the carers' groups which properly and succintly made the point that the level of care they provide cannot be quantified in financial terms. In that regard, it is most important that each budget and Social Welfare Bill recognises their commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to believe all the lobby groups, the Minister could wave a magic wand and provide for huge increases in social welfare payments. He has not taken that course. Instead he has adopted the prudent economic approach that has been the <Col N="291" /> hallmark of the Government in the past three and half years and ensured the most needy and vulnerable are provided for. We must not forget that this Bill is just one of the promised five budgets to be introduced by the Government. Perhaps Members might delay their comments on the Government's policy to continue to increase significantly social welfare payments until the next budget when the full programme will have been delivered.</P>
    <P>The increases proposed in the Bill are not the only provisions made by the Government. It is fair to take into account the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy's prudent investment of moneys from the sale of Eircom and other State assets in the pension fund. This will ensure the value and security of pensions can be assured for the next 30 years and beyond. &ldquo;From the cradle to the grave&rdquo; is a cliche, but it is a hallmark of the Government in terms of its increases in welfare payments at all levels.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a number of the Bill's provisions in more detail. The most important are those relating to maternity benefit. The Constitution properly values and cherishes children. The extension of the duration of maternity benefit will be cherished by the thousands of families who will welcome a new baby into their homes this year. Many mothers have spoken about how difficult it is to leave a three month old baby with a childminder. They find it an unbelievable strain. They will welcome the extra time afforded to them. Some employers might complain, but they should acknowledge that happy and relaxed employees are more productive. The extra four weeks will give mothers cherished time with their babies. We should remember that our nation's most valuable asset is its children.</P>
    <P>It is important and welcome that adoptive parents will also benefit from an extra four weeks leave. The Government is committed to ensuring parents are supported, financially and practically, in rearing their families. I ask the Minister to consider extending maternity benefit to cover the first year and, thereafter, providing a reduced benefit for the years up to school entry. Such benefits are available in other European countries, particularly Scandinavia. Encouraging and supporting more parents to stay at home will take pressure off the overburdened child minding services which cannot cope with current unprecedented demand. Not all parents would wish to take the full year and, as a result of having more time to organise child benefit, child care and so forth, would return to the workforce at their own pace.</P>
    <P>In the rush to fill the jobs needs of the economy we might be ignoring the most important job in society, child rearing. We must be ever vigilant that we govern and legislate for a society, not just an economy. I hope the Minister will consider extending the benefit to at least one year and making it available to both mothers and fathers. This benefit extension should also be available to <Col N="292" /> adoptive parents. It could be renamed &ldquo;parent's benefit&rdquo; and would be a most welcome and important provision.</P>
    <P>Regarding child benefit, the Government is investing huge amounts of money in supporting child care. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is ensuring child care places will be increased and improved by providing up to £230 million in coming years. The number of places will be increased and made affordable.</P>
    <P>Rearing children is expensive and parents are constantly stretched to meet the needs of growing children in the areas of food, clothing and, I presume, the occasional treat. The Minister is significantly increasing child benefit by £25 for the first two children and £30 for the third and subsequent children. These increases will make a great difference to families and will ensure parents are assisted in their efforts to support their families.</P>
    <P>We must recognise the value and importance of carers. For too long the position of those who looked after relatives was ignored but the increase in the carer's allowance is a step in the right direction. Carers provide a valuable service to the State and should be recognised for that contribution. We must continue to support their work to ensure the objectives of the Carers' Association inform Government policy. I also welcome the increase from £300 to £800 in the respite care grant.</P>
    <P>The changes announced in section 18 will allow for benefits to be paid to carers for six weeks after a death and will go a long way towards ensuring those who sacrificed so much in caring for a relative will have some small comfort during their transition from carer to supporting their own lives. Carers are a valuable resource and everything possible should be done to support them. The Social Welfare Bill should recognise this and we must continue to introduce improvements in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is concern about inflation and its effects on social welfare increases. The inflation rate is continuing to drop due to Government actions, thus protecting the social welfare increases which will put more money in people's pockets. While it is important to increase welfare benefits it is equally important to ensure they are not eaten up by increases in the inflation rate.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement is a useful tool for encouraging those on low pay to re-enter the work force. It is not possible for some people on social welfare to provide for their families, particularly if they are in jobs which pay the minimum wage. FIS allows people who wish to work to do so, but perhaps those on FIS should automatically be entitled to other benefits, particularly the medical card. Many people with families are concerned that they will lose their medical cards if they take up employment.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will contribute to the lives of the most needy in society. The Bill is part of a package of measures to which Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are committed to introducing. I acknowledge the benefits <Col N="293" /> announced in the Bill and thank the Minister for listening to the submissions he received which are reflected in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 2001. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, like the Minister for Finance, gets an opportunity every year to introduce legislation in his or her area of responsibility. Unlike other Ministers, the Minister does not have to fight for parliamentary time nor does he or she have to convince Cabinet colleagues that his or her proposals ought to get priority. It is a pity that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has consistently failed to use this annual opportunity to bring about the sort of fundamental change to the social welfare system that is necessary if we are to have a fair, equal and just society.</P>
      <P>The budget and the Bill are iniquitous in the way they deal with people and, as a result, they threaten social partnership. The voluntary and community sector threatened to withdraw from partnership because it felt the budget was iniquitous and betrayed the poorest in society.</P>

      <P>The budget threatened social partnership and the voluntary and community sector threatened to withdraw. That sector includes organisations such as CORI, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and groups working with the most disadvantaged people in society. Is Deputy O'Flynn suggesting that every one of those groups got it wrong? I do not believe they got it wrong. The social welfare system does not promote equality, is not family friendly, discriminates against women, does not deal properly with people with disabilities and does not adequately recognise carers.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House has many good features but it is narrowly focused in the sense that it contains no vision of the future development of the social welfare system and does not seem to take account of other Government policies. There is no evidence of coherence with policies in the areas of equality, health or even the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> This Government's policies &ndash; if the word can be so applied &ndash; in the areas of social services, the family and equality are marked by a total absence of vision and of planning to realise that vision. The measures are <i>ad hoc</i> and provide for once-off increases without a strategy to move towards an appropriate benchmark. I wish to highlight the issue of benchmarking payments.</P>
    <P>Other changes address once-off issues, again without a coherent view of future plans. Decisions are made in one area without taking account of their effects in other areas. This is particularly the case in the area of medical card income guidelines which do not take account of increases in social welfare payments and the different arrangements made for carers in the tax and social welfare systems.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence of the Government's view of how families should be supported. There is the traditional view of, &ldquo;we will look after you with handouts,&rdquo; but there is no plan or strategy. Just as we need careful planning to implement infrastructural investment, we also need careful planning to implement coherent income support arrangements for families. We need the equivalent of the national development plan for the social services. We also need to set targets and objectives and a timetable for their achievement. We also need to critically examine all aspects of the services to ensure they promote equality and are family friendly.</P>
    <P>I accept the structural problems within the social welfare system cannot be remedied in one Bill. This is why we need a plan. We need to decide in what direction we are going and how to get there. Instead of a self-congratulatory account of what the Minister has done, I would have preferred to hear the Minister's views on how the social welfare system should develop. Has the Minister a view on the individualisation of social welfare payments? Has he any thoughts on how the in-built bias against people in stable, permanent relationships can be addressed? A recent detailed report highlighted the situation of lone parents. It is clear that there are serious problems within the social welfare system regarding many people who wish to be in stable relationships. The system discriminates against such people but what are we going to do about it? What measures will be introduced to end this bias? The current situation is unacceptable. What plans does the Minister have to address the recommendations in the report? There is no evidence in the Bill that he intends to address this issue.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister have an equality strategy for social welfare? Has he looked at the social welfare system to see how its underlying sexist and ageist attitudes can be changed? If so, he is very shy about sharing his thoughts with us. The social welfare system does not promote equality, is not family friendly and there is little in this Bill which will improve this situation.</P>
    <P>Critics of the Equality Authority who have been vocal lately regarding ageist advertising would do well to examine the sexist and ageist <Col N="295" /> aspects of the social welfare system and understand why we need an Equality Authority which is continually addressing these issues.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the issue of equality for women in the social welfare system. The overt evidence of discrimination on the basis of sex has been removed but that does not mean the system promotes equality. The social welfare system treats men and women equally in the sense that all its provisions are formally gender neutral. However, women remain at a disadvantage because of the retention of the concept of adult dependency, even if the name has been changed, and because the inequalities of the past have not been rectified. The qualified adult allowance, in spite of its name change, has the effect of keeping women as dependants. It ensures certain women do not go out to work or only work for restricted hours. This system must be phased out. What plans does the Minister have to do this? Older women were discriminated against in the past and the results of that discrimination are not being addressed. I accept there is not a simple solution but I do not accept that we should not look for partial solutions.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider extending the home care credit system to those who were carers before 1994? This would allow some older women to qualify for pensions in their own right and it would go some way towards recognising the contribution they made to the good of society. There is no doubt the prosperity of this generation has been built on the work of the older generation. The least we can do for these women is to recognise that and to try to rectify some of the past discrimination they suffered by giving them credits for the work they did in the home which is not recognised as far as pensions are concerned. I hope the new Pensions Bill will go some way towards addressing that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the intention to bring the contributory widows and widowers pension into line with the contributory old age pension. The increasing duration of maternity and adoptive benefit is welcome but I regret the opportunity was not taken to increase it more substantially. Our maternity benefit is low by international standards. We should be generous at a time of plenty and it will work to the advantage of the economy. If women have more choice and are able to spend more time at home when their babies are young and when they want to be there, it will be easier for them to make decisions about rejoining the workforce at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I regret the opportunity was not taken to introduce a payment for parental leave. We will not have genuine equality in family arrangements while parental leave remains a theoretical right because it is unpaid. I recently asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform what number of people are taking up parental leave. He was unable to give me the figures but it is clear the numbers are low because it is unpaid and people cannot afford to take it. Parental leave is <Col N="296" /> paid in many other countries and we should do the same. Plans should be put in place for the phased introduction of paid paternal leave.</P>
    <P>Why were 8,500 women excluded from the benefits of the new maternity benefit? Why did the Minister not take the opportunity to introduce maternity benefit when he introduced the budget? Why was it left until two weeks ago which meant that 8,500 women lost out on extended maternity benefit? All that was needed was a resolution to be passed in the Dáil the day the budget was introduced.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 16 which will end the restriction which applied to married and cohabiting couples where one is receiving a disability allowance and the other is receiving one of a number of social welfare payments. This means the disability allowance is being individualised to some extent, while the means test will continue to apply to the couple. Can the Minister indicate if and when he proposes to do the same for payments, such as unemployment assistance, and if he has plans to move towards a total individualisation of means testing as well as payments? People with disabilities need a cost of disability payment to allow them to compete on equal terms with the rest of society. I am aware that the issue is one of many social welfare issues being examined under the PPF. However, having an issue examined in this way under the PPF is akin to making it <i>sub judice</i>. There is nothing to stop the Minister addressing this issue even if it is being looked at under the PPF. It is a convenient excuse for not addressing issues in this House.</P>
    <P>As regards carers and how we deal with carers in our society, the major shortcoming of the social welfare system is the absence of a recognition of caring. We now have two payments for carers but neither of them constitutes a recognition that caring <i>per se </i>should be rewarded. One payment, the carer's allowance, is a means tested payment for low income carers, while the other payment, carer's benefit, is a short compensation for giving up work. The contribution of family carers is not recognised, much less rewarded. I heard a Fianna Fáil colleague say that if we were more generous in this area, we would save the State money. The cost of residential care is enormous. This is another instance where we need a plan for the introduction of a carer's payment which is not contingent on means or social insurance.</P>
    <P>There is no coherence in the Bill between social welfare and tax policies on caring. The home carer's tax credit is exactly the same whether one is caring for a healthy 18 year old or an incapacitated child or adult. This credit is not available if the person being cared for is a spouse. Yet, there is a reasonably generous tax allowance if a person can afford to employ a carer to look after an incapacitated person at home. I ask the Minister to address this in the Bill. This is evidence of a lack of coherence between the different branches of Government. Carers should be rewarded through the social welfare system and <Col N="297" /> tax allowances or credits are not an appropriate way to do this.</P>
    <P>As regards equality for older people, people aged between 65 and 66 are excluded from work if they receive a retirement pension. This is a glaring inequality but it also does not make economic sense in a society where there is a shortage of skilled workers. The removal of the restriction on working would involve a relatively small change and I ask the Minister to consider such an amendment on Committee Stage. Significant changes could also be made in the pre-retirement allowance to encourage recipients to return to work. This is not as simple as the changes needed in the retirement pension but, with a little imagination, a scheme could be devised which would allow people to retain their allowance and still have an incentive to work. This should be seriously examined, given the shortage of workers and the wish of many older people to continue to make a contribution in the workplace.</P>
    <P>It is clear it is the intention to allow child dependent allowances to wither away as they have not been increased for seven years. I agree that the best way to support children is to have an adequate level of child benefit, that is, a basic income for children. Yet we have not formulated a policy on a basic income for children or on what it should cover. It is time to examine this issue. The Government does not have a clear policy on child support. It has not stated that it intends to have a basic income for children or to abolish child dependent allowances. Why is it reticent? Why do we not have a timetable for the full implementation of this policy?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael fully supports universal child benefit as the best means of providing a basic income for children. However, there is some confused thinking about this payment. It is a basic income for children, not a means of providing for child care. It is society's contribution to the costs of rearing children. Child care is a separate issue and should be dealt with separately. Child care is a cost incurred by parents which should be addressed in a child care policy. There is confusion about what child benefit is for. It is expected to cover everything for children. However, it is clear from the costs involved in child care that it cannot do this. The Government has singularly failed to address the issue of child care costs either through the social welfare system or through the tax system in spite of its clear commitment to do so in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>It is well recognised that the current structure of social welfare payments acts as a disincentive to young couples to form stable households in which to raise children. There are many difficult issues to be addressed in rectifying this but we are avoiding the issue at present. It has been clearly identified in the recent report on one parent families that we need a phased programme of change in the present arrangements for cohabiting and married couples so they do not face a substantial financial penalty for raising their children together. Is that not a basic point? With the <Col N="298" /> increasing numbers of lone parents, single households and the attendant risk of poverty for those women and children, now is the time for the Minister to begin to address this issue in a phased way in consultation with the many groups which have an interest in this area. Every Deputy agrees that such change is required. Every week we see couples being discriminated against who would prefer to be together, yet they cannot because of the payments system.</P>
    <P>There is a long-standing anomaly in the PRSI system which affects women more than men &ndash; the rule that employed family members are excluded from paying PRSI. This is an anti-family policy which discriminates against women and should be changed immediately. The Minister should consider doing this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The welcome increases in social welfare payments, although not high enough, are not being matched in other areas of the social services. The medical card income guidelines need to be re-examined. There is a particular problem for those under the age of 70 years whose only source of income is a social welfare pension.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the differences in the tax and social welfare treatment of carers and the need for greater coherence. Given the buoyancy in the economy, we have never had such a good opportunity for fundamental change, but this opportunity is being wasted. We are only tinkering at the edges. We are not laying the basis for an equal, just system, which would be an enormous contributor to economic growth. It would free people to contribute to economic growth and move more easily between the family and workplace. While the changes are welcome, if we had improved maternity leave more dramatically and had dealt with the issue of parental leave more efficiently, we would be giving parents, individuals and workers greater choice and flexibility which would enable them to combine their work and family responsibilities more effectively. In the long run this would be to the benefit of society and the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the financial implications of the Bill in the longer term. Although it is difficult to see in the current prolonged boom, a rainy day is bound to come. Furthermore, sooner or later, our demographics will be such that the average age of our population will be higher than it is now. Other countries in the European Union are experiencing this phenomenon which they call the pensions time <Col N="301" /> bomb. Perhaps Deputy Noonan will explain it in detail as he is the person who coined the phrase booby-trap budget. That term is nearly as good as the Celtic snail. Let me tell Deputy Noonan that we have defused the pensions time bomb once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Be careful of Kathleen Lynch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is widely recognised that our much criticised Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has, probably, taken the wisest Government decision in establishing a long-term pension fund reserve to ensure State pensions. When the rainy day comes, I predict that many will be thanking the Minister for his foresight. We can introduce an increase of £10 per week in pensions because we have provided for the long-term maintenance of State pensions. This is called strategic long-term planning, a subject entirely foreign to the short-term &ldquo;power-grabbing at any cost&rdquo; merchants on the other side of the House. They are only waiting to return to Government to raid the pensions reserve. I wish to nail my colours to the mast on this issue by saying, &ldquo;Hands off the pension reserve&rdquo;. This is an election issue and any party that does not give a commitment to respect the integrity of the pensions reserve fund, established by the Minister for Finance should not be voted into office.</P>
      <P>The one controversial provision in the Bill relates to PRSI and it is a measure of exactly where Fianna Fáil stands on social welfare that the only complaint has come from the right of the political spectrum. It is understandable that employers will object to any increases in PRSI overheads on labour costs. However, I must defend this measure as necessary to provide a more equitable contribution to the State pensions of employees. The ceiling for employers' PRSI contributions was a necessary measure in a climate of high unemployment. We have moved on to an enterprise economy where we are in the open business of wealth creation for all. We are now talking about jobs as a means to a greater end, which happens to include a good quality of life. Part of that means having a strong social safety net, including provision for pensions for all.</P>
      <P>In a strong economy, there is no justification for letting employers in the strongest growth sector who are paying the highest wages effectively pay only a small fraction of the PRSI overhead, leaving small shopkeepers and other employers of low-skilled staff to pay the full overhead. We are trying to level the playing pitch. If the receipts from the new PRSI regime prove strong, I would favour reducing the percentage of employers' PRSI contributions rather than reintroducing a ceiling. If we should ever be so unfortunate as to develop serious unemployment &ndash; it will not be as a result of this or any other Fianna Fáil Government &ndash; we would have to revisit the measure and, possibly, reimpose the ceiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third issue with which I want to deal is the introduction of the euro. We all know pensioners, <Col N="302" /> in particular, keep a close eye on the figures. I emphasise it is imperative to present the euro changeover as it relates to social welfare in general and pensions in particular in as transparent a manner as possible. We all know pensioners will not lose a penny over the euro changeover, but we need to convince every pensioner of that. I ask the Minister and his officials to consider the feasibility of introducing explanatory leaflets from the Department to explain the euro changeover and the difference that will mean in the currency for all recipients of social welfare pensions and other benefits. I also appeal to all Deputies to avoid using the euro as a political football to cause confusion and noise during the next 12 months in the election year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Deputy who plays on the fears of vulnerable people over the euro changeover should be shown the red card at the next election.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the crackdown on those who have been cheating taxpayers over a long period by drawing money under false pretences and depriving those in genuine need of social welfare payments of the moneys we are now able to give them. Those guilty of that offence have deprived genuine social welfare recipients of hundreds of millions of pounds. I noted this week that a number of people have been taken out of the social welfare system and several hundred millions of pounds have been saved. I congratulate the Minister, his officials and the staff in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs on the work they have done in this area over the past 12 months. It will make a difference as there will be more money in the kitty to provide for those who are genuinely unemployed, sick of disabled.</P>
      <P>Many people who were genuinely out of work have been given the opportunity to return to work. The rate of unemployment at 4% is at its lowest, and that reflects fantastic success in that area. I congratulate the Government, business companies, the workers of Ireland, politicians on all sides of the House and everyone else for helping to create the economy we have today, which is the envy of Europe.</P>

        <b>: </b>I thank Deputy O'Flynn for sharing his time with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing a caring Social Welfare Bill, particularly in regard to the manner in which it deals with pensioners, people with disabilities, people in receipt of an <Col N="303" /> invalidity pension, widows and other social welfare recipients. That is as it should be, as those people made tremendous sacrifices over the years when times were not as good as they are now. It is only right when the economy is booming that we afford those people the opportunity to enjoy a decent standard of living. The Government must be complimented on the increases in pension benefit ranging from £5 to £10 per week compared with the insult of increases of £1.50 per week and less given under the rainbow coalition Government. Having been a former Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Durkan must get embarrassed at times when he reflects on the miserly pension increases that were given during that time. He was hamstrung by having an ex Democratic Left Minister, Deputy De Rossa, in that Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>: </b>Those very small increases were an insult at that time. We hear the Opposition, particularly the Fine Gael Party, claiming all the credit for the booming economy we are currently enjoying. The economy was also booming in 1996 and 1997, yet the former Minister, Deputy De Rossa, then a member of Democratic Left, decided to give very small increases to the less well off in our society, despite championing himself as the great saviour of the less well off at that time.</P>
      <P>Some provisions in the Bill are particularly welcome, including the increase of £6 in the living alone allowance for recipients of disability allowance and invalidity pension who are living alone. People living alone certainly need that extra money, as they are generally living on a very low income.</P>
      <P>The Acting Chairman, myself and other Members have made a case for widows during previous budget debates. They have been the unsung heroes of this country for many years, yet they got very little social welfare benefit. My mother was widowed at a very young age and reared eight children. The amount of money she got from the State during that period was an insult and life was very difficult for her. There were many such mothers throughout the country. It is only right that widows and widowers should be entitled to a decent income. I welcome that the Minister decided to substantially increase their social welfare benefit. I hope he will go a step further in the next budget and make life easier for those people who have put a tremendous amount of time and effort into rearing their families in difficult circumstances and made a valuable contribution to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal can be done for families by granting increases in child benefit. I welcome the increases in that benefit and I hope they will continue. While a debate is taking place on whether <Col N="304" /> payments of child benefit and the provision of child care should be matched or left separate, increases in child benefit allowance is probably the best means of ensuring families have a decent income and standard of living.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister on some aspects of the Bill. The carer's allowance is a very good scheme, but the income threshold for means testing is too tight. As a result the allowance is not effective in helping many families who should benefit from it. The income threshold for means testing should be substantially increased. When one considers it can cost £1,000 per week or more for a person to be cared for in a hospital, for a very small amount of money many people would be prepared to look after an elderly relative at home, if they were entitled to a decent carer's allowance. This scheme needs to be seriously examined.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a granny carer's allowance scheme, although that might not be the title it would be called, should also be considered. A number of my constituents in receipt of old age pension are still looking after a handicapped son or daughter who may be 35 of 40 years of age, but they have been told they are not entitled to a carer's allowance as they are in receipt of the old age pension. Those are the forgotten people.</P>
    <P>I know of a widow in my town, who has been a widow for as long as I can remember, who reared a physically challenged daughter for the best part of 40 years and who for most of her life could not get a carer's allowance because such an allowance was not in place. She is approaching pension age and has been told that she does not qualify for any type of carer's allowance. That is not good enough. She has looked after that child through thick and thin for the best part of 40 years. The anomalies in the system need to be addressed. If that widow and others who look after physically challenged people were given even a small allowance for caring for them, it would be the difference between their having and not having a decent standard of living. I ask the Minister to reconsider that scheme and provide for those carers who have been completely forgotten.</P>
    <P>I have had many arguments with the Minister about the free fuel allowance scheme. The allowance should be at least doubled to £12 per week and the free ESB units should be doubled for the winter months, given that the price of oil, gas and coal has shot up dramatically in recent years, which has been a severe burden for old people. They often remain in bed many days during the winter because they cannot afford to cover their heating costs. The Minister should address this issue in the next budget and double the free fuel allowance and the free ESB units for the winter. I made this case on a number of occasions, including to the Minister at an all-party committee. He increased the number of weeks covered under the free fuel allowance scheme this year, but he should go a step further in the next budget and substantially increase the free fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> I have no problem with the crackdown on fraud, but I have a serious problem with social welfare officers removing from the system those who are genuinely entitled to social welfare payments. Some social welfare officers are decent but there are others who should attend a course on how to be consumer-friendly, on how to deal with the public and on how to adopt a different attitude because their attitude towards social welfare recipients is appalling. People are frequently asked how they can afford a new television or a new carpet. Do community welfare officers want people to live in abject poverty?</P>
    <P>The manner in which people are removed from the social welfare system is disgraceful. They are told they are not looking for work even though they might have sent out 20 letters seeking employment or they might be 55 or 60 years old and have difficulty securing employment. The role of community welfare officers needs to be seriously examined because more often than not they undertake an interrogation of recipients rather than an investigation or a friendly chat. That is not good enough. There is a serious need to establish a course for such officers on how to deal with the public and on how to assess people. I have met many individuals over the years whose social welfare payments were stopped even though they had applied for numerous jobs and had undertaken FÁS schemes as soon as positions became available.</P>
    <P>When an individual appeals a decision of the community welfare officer the chief appeals office usually concurs with the officer. I appeal to the Minister to take action to speed up appeals. In my neck of the woods it takes between four and six months for appeals to be heard in regard to unemployment assistance and benefit and disability benefit. People should not have to wait that long to have an appeal heard. If there are staffing or other problems, they should be addressed. While the chief appeals office is an independent body, the Minister of the day is responsible for providing adequate resources to these offices.</P>
    <P>I generally welcome the social welfare increases but some anomalies need to be addressed and I ask the Minister to take them on board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the Minister's contribution to the budget debate. In the first paragraph he stated:</P>
      <P>In the area of social, community and family affairs this budget is radical, progressive, a bold statement of action and a declaration that the wealth and resources of this country are to be directed as never before towards the needs of the poor, the underprivileged and the aged.</P>
      <P>I thought this was a Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis speech because he mentioned republicanism seven times in the first four pages, including comments to the effect &ldquo;republicanism . . . moulds our policy&rdquo; and &ldquo;republicanism is about the people of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My duty, like that of Deputy Browne, is to deal with the anomalies in the budget and to highlight where resources are not directed towards the needs of the poor, the underprivileged and the aged. The Minister, in his contribution to this debate yesterday, stated: &ldquo;In 1997, we spent almost one pound in every four of total social welfare expenditure on employment and unemployment supports. Today, that is down to one pound in every seven&rdquo;. While that is welcome, it underlines the phenomenal resources available to the Minister to address the anomalies to which Members have drawn his attention in the past few years.</P>
      <P>For example, disabled drivers were in receipt of a mobility allowance of £45 per month prior to the budget. The Minister made great play on increasing the allowance to £90 per month, but from 1 April disabled persons in receipt of motor vehicle tax concessions will not be eligible for the allowance. They will lose the mobility allowance which they enjoyed previously. Only 2,600 people are in receipt of the mobility allowance. I do not know how many people are in receipt of motor tax concessions but I am sure the number is smaller than that. The Minister has created a mean spirited anomaly in the budget and I hope I have the support of Deputy Browne and others in ensuring he eliminates it.</P>
      <P>The Irish Wheelchair Association, in particular, was concerned about the withdrawal of some people's entitlement to the mobility allowance. It stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mobility allowance is currently paid at the maximum rate of £45 per month by the relevant health boards to compensate people, who are permanently unable to walk, for lack of accessible public transport. The criteria for eligibility for the mobility allowance are so stringent and only applied to 2,600 people in receipt of this allowance last year. The criteria <Col N="307" /> include the degree of disability, age limits, mean testing which is currently set at the lowest level, in other words basic invalidity pension or disability allowance. The health boards also have to decide if a person will benefit from occasionally leaving their home.</P>
    <P>The criteria for the allowance are stringent. I cannot understand why the Minister wants to disallow disabled people from receiving the allowance because they are in receipt of motor tax concessions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also made great play on the increases in social welfare payments, including the old age pension. However, there is an anomaly in regard to an old age pensioner or any other social welfare recipient who lives in a local authority house. They were elated by the increases announced in the budget and promulgated by the Minister but following the next review of local authority rents the increase will be taken by the local authorities. The Minister should address this anomaly because he cannot say he will give people an increase if the local authorities legitimately under the rents criteria take that money from them.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to help everybody and he has highlighted the carer's allowance. However, there are many anomalies in this regard, some of which Deputy Browne mentioned. I will mention some others. I am sick to death of trying to have the anomaly in regard to widows corrected. I have raised it with the planning unit in the Department. Both Deputy Durkan and myself have raised it with officials of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs when they have appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts. I have also raised this anomaly during Question Time, in letters to the Minister and during debates on Social Welfare Bills over the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with a case in Galway of a person who cared for her husband's doubly incontinent, bed-ridden father in their home. She was in receipt of the carer's allowance because her husband was a small farmer with an income of less than £150 per week. Unfortunately, her husband passed away. She is still a carer 365 days a year but is no longer in receipt of the carer's allowance because she qualified for the widow's pension. I am sick of trying to have that anomaly corrected. Nobody takes any heed of it. There is another anomaly in the carer's allowance that I came across yesterday. If somebody qualifies for the carer's benefit, it is guaranteed that his or her job will be held for 15 months. This week I dealt with a case of a married nurse who came home from England to mind her mother who had had a sudden stroke, and a mentally and physically retarded person who her mother had been minding. She applied for the carer's benefit to get time off. Because we do not have a bilateral agreement with Britain, which pays the person receiving the care rather than the carer, the woman cannot get the carer's benefit. Her husband's income in <Col N="308" /> England is being used to deny her the carer's allowance in Ireland. She is willing to forego her job in England to mind her mother if she is given the allowance.</P>
    <P>A bilateral arrangement should be put in place to guarantee the job of a person receiving carer's allowance in another EU state. A person from Cork who goes to Mayo, Galway or Donegal would receive this guarantee. These anomalies should be looked at by the Minister. There are only 17,000 carers in the State who get benefit. The Minister spoke of his free transport initiative, but it is of no use to people where no public transport exists, for example in Lettermullin, Rosmuc or Ballyconneely in my constituency. The Minister should allow hackney concessions or taxi vouchers for such people. Carers now qualify for a respite payment, to allow them take a couple of weeks off in the summer. There are 60,000 carers in the country who do not qualify for the carer's allowance, but should be entitled to a respite grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to take advice from Deputy O'Flynn, who is concerned that Members who vote against the budget are voting against the interests of social welfare recipients. We vote against it because increases are not high enough and the Government did not respond fast enough. I reject the suggestion that payments during the previous Government did not have the same impact as they do today. The reverse is true because social welfare increases during that time were at least comparable to inflation, which was minimal. Taking the increases of the past four years and taking into account the annual inflation rate, one will find that the increases now given are barely covering inflation.</P>
      <P>This is a cause of serious concern to those who depend on social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister, who looks deeply concerned, that this Government's election manifesto said everybody would have £100 per week. Although this was held up as a carrot for the electorate to aspire to, it was nothing extraordinary as social welfare would have risen to this level to stay above inflation in any event. I remind the parties opposite we have had the highest inflation level in the Euro zone for several years. I am aware that they are in election mode, but I would not like to see that go to their heads as it leads to serious exaggeration. I am delighted to see that the Minister responsible has now arrived in the House to take control of this disastrous situation.</P>

      <P>The Minister, Deputy Dermot <Col N="309" /> Ahern is not famous for coming into the House for Adjournment debates. Deputy John Browne blamed social welfare officials for extraordinary interpretations when examining regulations concerning various allowances or payments applied for. I do not blame the officials as the Minister has absolute and ultimate control and gives the instructions. When someone on this side of the House puts down a question criticising the Minister's activities, he says he has no function in the matter and his hands are tied because decisions are taken by officials in his Department. Such decisions are only taken on the basis of the Minister's instructions, as has always been the case and always will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is suggesting that he has no function in that area, I wonder what he is doing there. Is he merely a figurehead? Has he no function in the matter at all? Does he not accept any responsibility for decisions taken by the Department? This is a rare opportunity to query the Minister on social welfare. He has never been here for the Adjournment debate, as far as I know. Although I hate to be critical, it is a fact that the Minister needs to take on board. We regard the little job we do in Opposition as serious. To treat it with contempt by refusing to come in to answer questions on the Adjournment is beneath contempt, and I want to register my protest in the strongest possible fashion. The Minister knows what I say is the truth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct. Many people seem to think that social welfare recipients are well off, and should be grateful for what they get. We are supposed to be riding a Celtic Tiger around the countryside. Everywhere one is supposed to hear the roar of the tiger and experience the ambience that goes with it. What happens to those who are dependent on social welfare payments? They become more and more conscious of their dependence on social welfare, on a fixed income. If anything beyond the run of the mill goes wrong, they are in deep trouble. If the ESB bill or chemist's bill is higher than usual or a medical card is not restored on time, they are vulnerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to repeat the points made by Deputy McCormack and others in relation to carers. There are up to 100,000 people caring for others, but only about 11,000 receive an allowance. Qualification for the carer's allowance should not be income-related. The numbers are not as important as the degree of attention required by the person being cared for, which should be rewarded in almost all cases. In a competitive labour market, it is of acute importance that this point is taken on board. Previous Ministers tried to do their best. The area needs to be more closely considered. I am conscious of the <Col N="310" /> time, as I would love to have an hour to unburden myself of my many whinges in this area. Many such concerns were there before I entered the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, and many remain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Action should be taken on the issue of bilateral arrangements whereby a person's contributions are collated with contributions in another country. Processing such applications takes too long. More often than not a person is dead before retirement pension is processed. People live in hope due to bilateral arrangements. They are supposed to expedite the examination of a person's entitlement, but it cannot be done with Belgium, an EU state, or the United Kingdom, our neighbour. Bringing the process to a conclusion requires a visit to the country concerned. With our workload in this House, we do not have time for that. Something should be done to eliminate the glitches in the system.</P>
      <P>The Government should not gloat over the impact made on old age pensioners, widows and widowers by improved benefits. Public expectation is higher than before. Average incomes have dramatically increased. An increase of £5 or £10 per week is not extraordinary. It is short of what would be expected by comparison with the consumer price index and incomes generally.</P>
      <P>I do not have time to comment on the various free schemes, or child benefit on which I hold strong views. A future social welfare Bill from the Government, if there is one, must address the needs of social welfare recipients and contain less rhetoric on how well it has done compared to previous Administrations. That was then, this is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister and his officials on this important, comprehensive Bill which contributes to the construction of a new Ireland and delivers on the promises and commitments made in the Government's programme, the Fianna Fáil manifesto and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It is part of a comprehensive plan to improve the lot of pensioners, families, women and the disadvantaged. The Government values the contribution that every citizen can and is entitled to make to society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill promotes inclusiveness, particularly for the disadvantaged. The Government is improving the quality of life for all citizens and will not be deflected from this purpose. The Opposition parties are so obsessed with other issues that they have lost touch with the bread and butter concerns of ordinary people. The Labour Party criticises the Government for reducing tax rates and failing to spend money on people and services, but the Government is correct to reduce the tax burden on the ordinary worker to enable him or her to retain more of his or her own money and exercise freedom of choice in <Col N="311" /> spending it. This policy has benefited the Exchequer, the economy and individual workers.</P>
    <P>The Government has not abandoned its commitment to social solidarity. The Bill ensures the benefits of economic progress will be distributed to everyone. The Opposition forgets that wealth must be created before it can be shared. The Government has a vision of society and will ensure all citizens realise their potential and enjoy a better quality of life. That is what social inclusion and partnership mean.</P>
    <P>The electorate will ask how we handled the politics of success. The Opposition never faced that question as it never made a success of the economy or society. The social welfare increases they introduced while in office were so small as to be unnoticeable. They disappointed recipients. These increases are the largest ever introduced by a Government. Fianna Fáil is proud to deliver to the people.</P>
    <P>The full year cost of improvements in 1998 was £225 million, in 1999, £316 million and in 2000, £403 million. The full year cost in 2001 will be £850 million. Benefit increases have outstripped inflation in successive years, which means recipients have received real increases. Total expenditure was £4.5 billion. This year's estimate is £6.2 billion. Almost one million pensioners and qualified adults will receive increases. An estimated 530,000 families will receive an increase in child benefit. Over 132,500 families with three or more children will receive an extra £80 per month. A total of 17,500 low income families will benefit from the new threshold for family income supplement. Carers are supported through increases in their allowance. This is an important element in encouraging the exercise of individual, social and family responsibilities which are threatened by recent social changes. The Carer's Leave Bill is a welcome initiative of a consistently comprehensive Government policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister is rightly proud of his record. The lot of carers has been improved. There are more than 16,000 in receipt of carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>There were additional budget increases in 1998 for carers aged over 66 years and free travel passes were made available for anyone in receipt of the allowance. In the 1999 budget, among other items, carers received free telephone rental. The relaxation of the full-time care and attention rule permitted allowance holders to take up paid employment for up to ten hours a week. The allowance was extended to individuals caring for people aged between 16 and 65 years and those caring for recipients of domiciliary care allowance.</P>
    <P>The respite care grant of £200 was increased to £300 under budget 2000. In addition, the back to education allowance was extended to carers after their caring responsibilities ceased. A carer's benefit scheme was introduced and the free electricity and free telephone allowances were extended to all carers in receipt of the carer's allowance. The Minister for Social, Community <Col N="312" /> and Family Affairs has commissioned a consultancy study on the future financing of long-term care to help shape future policy direction in this area.</P>
    <P>In budget 2001, the carer's allowance was further increased by £10 for people aged over 66 years and £8 for people under 66 years. The income disregard for means assessment for the allowances was increased from £75 for single people and £150 for couples to £125 for single people and £250 for couples. The respite care grant was further increased to £400 and two grants will now be paid to carers looking after two or more people. These are practical, caring measures and it is extremely important that these supports and benefits continue to be allocated to carers.</P>
    <P>Nobody on the Opposition benches can credibly claim in the face of such evidence that the Government is uncaring. The Government is committed to social inclusiveness and improving the conditions of those who are disadvantaged. It has constantly and determinedly applied resources towards the creation of a better society for all. The benefits have not only been substantially increased, but payment dates have been brought forward as promised. Increased benefits will now be paid from the first week in April. This is four weeks early and this policy will continue when the tax and social welfare codes are fully aligned with the calendar year from January 2002.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the major increases in maternity and adoptive benefits. These additional commitments to family support will be welcomed by mothers with young families or women planning families. The duration of maternity leave and benefits has been increased from 14 to 18 weeks while adoptive leave and benefits has been increased from four weeks to 18 weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Johnny Brady for sharing his time. I congratulate the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on continuing the outstanding progress being made during his tenure in the Department. He has proved himself a reforming and caring Minister who is capable of bringing forward a range of innovative ideas to further develop the extensive services provided by his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this debate is the announcement of the latest unemployment figures which show unemployment at an all time low. This is a tremendous achievement for everybody because all sections of society have made a significant contribution to reaching that worthy objective. This must be considered in view of the fact that there is no longer any involuntary emigration. Instead, there is significant net immigration with people returning to Ireland to develop and further their careers and raise families. The nation can be proud of what has been achieved in recent years and the Minister for Social, Community and Fam<Col N="313" /> ily Affairs has made a significant contribution to that progress.</P>
    <P>There continues to be a hard core of long-term unemployed and these people will need special care and attention and special intervention measures on a one-to-one basis. The Minister is working closely with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her Department to try to reach out to people who perhaps have not ever worked and who find it increasingly difficult to return to work because of complex social reasons. However, we cannot allow those people to be forgotten. This is why I particularly welcome the recent announcement by the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, in relation to the proposed development in the 25 RAPID areas throughout the country which require special intervention and investment.</P>
    <P>The investment offered is significant and it will make an impact in areas of particular disadvantage. For a variety of reasons, these areas have been neglected by the State in recent years, but they are beginning to come into their own. The Ballymun area is a prime example in that regard and there was the recent announcement in relation to Fatima Mansions. These places and parts of my constituency are beginning to make significant progress in terms of infrastructure, etc, and this will impact on the lives of the people who chose to continue to live there through thick and thin. This is why I particularly welcome the recent announcement by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Government must be prepared to say that certain areas require special attention. It must be prepared to name those areas and invest in them. This is happening at present and it will make a significant difference to the lives of people in those areas of extreme disadvantage. Other areas were successful in developing their infrastructure and providing jobs, schools and recreational facilities over the years because they were stronger and had access to more resources from within their communities. It is now the turn of other areas which have been left behind for many years to receive the level of resources and investment to which they are rightfully entitled and which will make a significant difference to the lives of the people. particularly young people, there.</P>
    <P>This is the UN International Year of the Volunteer and on 5 December last the Minister announced a national committee, which I have the honour of chairing. The committee represents all strands of society and has been given targets to deliver over the next two years. I wish to raise with the Minister the issue of volunteering &ndash; an issue with which he is familiar &ndash; and how his Department can impact on that activity. It is not always clear how a person can engage in voluntary activity while at the same receive a social welfare payment. There is a degree of confusion at times about this issue.</P>
    <P>A number of people engaged with a charitable organisation found themselves in difficulty <Col N="314" /> recently with departmental officers in relation to drawing down social welfare benefits. Their payments were cut off and the Minister should consider this area and clarify the rights of those involved in voluntary activity. Approximately 33% of adults are involved in voluntary activity and they contribute millions of hours of voluntary effort to society. The committee established by the Minister on behalf of the Government must try to ensure that number grows because it is important to have a strong and vibrant voluntary sector. This includes people who go abroad, but also those who remain at home and engage in community activities.</P>
    <P>The rights and entitlements of people engaged in voluntary activity must be clear in the context of drawing down social welfare benefits. Voluntary work makes a difference to the lives of people, particularly those who have been unemployed for some time. It is good that they want to engage in voluntary activity and it makes a significant contribution in the area in which they are working. It also relates to people who have a disability. The Minister will receive proposals from the committee on this matter, but I urge him to consider making it easier for people to engage in voluntary activity. The rights and entitlement of people engaged in these activities should be made clear to departmental staff.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made with regard to social welfare payments in the past few years, and that should be the case. It would be unacceptable if the Government were to give increases similar to those given prior to it taking up office. The small increases then were probably a reflection of the financial times in which we lived or of the manner in which government was run under the rainbow coalition. Nevertheless, since the Government has come into office increases in social welfare benefits have been significant.</P>
    <P>The Minister must continue that process as we are still only catching up. Those who, for various reasons, are still in receipt of social welfare payments can look only to the Government to improve their circumstances. They are as entitled, if not more so, to receive significant increases as those in employment due to their need to catch up. The recent increases are making a major difference to people's lives. The Minister would, however, like to go further with whatever resources are made available to him.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his commitment to organisations in terms of grant aid and support. The lists which issue from his Department relating to grant aid and support in the areas of counselling, family services, infrastructure and services show the commitment of his Department to these areas. Grants and supports have been flowing from his Department in the past few of years. This has made a tremendous difference to people's lives, particularly in disadvantaged areas and in communities at a loss in terms of raising resources to provide the services they need.</P>
    <P>This is the fourth of a successful series of budg<Col N="315" /> ets and we look forward to the next one which will continue to develop and support the good work already done during the Minister's tenure.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Healy.</P>
      <P>I, too, compliment the Minister on some of the provisions he introduced in the Bill. As an Opposition Member, however, there are also measures with which I do not agree. Deputy Flood spoke about the long-term unemployed and I concur with many of his comments regarding the need for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to ensure consultation with these people on a one-to-one basis in as far as is humanly possible. When a person has been unemployed for a long time, he or she does not have the confidence necessary to return to the workforce. I have witnessed this when dealing with groups in my constituency in the past few weeks. These people do not believe any person would employ them. The onus is on the Minister to ensure facilities are available within his Department and throughout the country to provide such people with the expertise from relevant personnel to overcome this.</P>
      <P>I welcome the dramatic fall in unemployment figures in the past few years. There are still homes, however, where neither the parents nor their sons or daughters have worked outside the home. It is often the case that the youngest child in such homes, when starting school, will not have seen anyone in the household go out to work. We, both Government and Opposition, must change that and put in place the facilities to help these people overcome this.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers referred to social welfare officials. Part-time employees can be employed on a full-time basis for five, six or seven weeks in succession and can then be put on short-time work due solely to the financial position of the company for which they work. Many such people have not been able to draw unemployment benefit or assistance because they are not seeking work. They do not know from one week to the next when they will again work full time. Will the Minister direct his officials to permit such people to draw benefit when they are forced to work short-time. In many cases these people are in pensionable jobs, but they do not get the benefits to which they are rightfully entitled.</P>
      <P>The appeals officials with whom I have dealt are second to none. They are to be congratulated for the way they treat people who appeal cases. I have a concern, however, regarding a person who produces eight or ten letters in relation to an appeal. Applying for a job advertised in the newspaper is not seen as having the same value as seeking employment from someone in their locality. However, I congratulate those officials on the way they treat such applicants; I have nothing but praise for them and the way they deal with each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies have received a complaint from <Col N="316" /> the Irish Wheelchair Association and disabled constituents regarding the mobility allowance. The allowance is set to double to £90 per month in April and compensates disabled people for the lack of accessible public transport. We are informed that, from April next, people receiving tax concessions towards the purchase of adapted private vehicles will not be entitled to the mobility allowance. Is this the case and, if so, is it another example of this Government giving something with one hand and taking it back with the other? The criteria for the mobility allowance are stringently applied &ndash; there are only about 2,600 beneficiaries. I would appreciate if the Minister would examine this discrepancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not in the Minister's remit to rectify that? </P>
      <P>For some time the Labour Party has sought the inclusion of an inflation-proof measure in the Social Welfare Bill to protect people in receipt of social welfare payments against inflation. Although inflation has decreased in recent months, this is something which could be done to ensure that, if inflation rises again in the next year or two, at least the most vulnerable &ndash; the social welfare recipient &ndash; will not be worse off. The Labour Party spokesperson on social welfare, Deputy Broughan, will table amendments on this matter on Committee Stage and I ask the Minister to consider them.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued by the island allowance and I welcome it. I assume people will receive it because of their isolated position, but I am sure each Deputy in this House would be able to name hundreds in their constituencies who would be in a similar position, such as old age pensioners, who reside alone ten, 15 or 20 miles from the nearest town with no means of transport and who in many cases endure extra electricity costs in order to provide their own water. Such people would be in a similar situation to those entitled to this allowance. I hope that matter will be considered on Committee Stage and that my party's spokesperson will table an amendment in that regard. It is good to see the provision of an allowance for people on the islands, but there are people just as badly off on the mainland because they live in secluded areas with no public transport, therefore, they have increased costs. The current trend is to move people into villages and towns, and people are being isolated as a result. In the Bill we could consider providing measures for old age pensioners in isolated areas in every constituency.</P>

    <P>Every Deputy who contributed to the Bill reflected on the carer's allowance. Carers are unique in Irish society because they work a 24 hour day, seven days a week. Everyone here knows of cases where people are caring for a son, daughter, husband or wife in extreme circumstances. In the Bill the Minister has not met the demands of Irish society to reflect its view of what <Col N="317" /> the carer's allowance should be and has not provided the help which we as a society should give to those people. I ask the Minister to review the carer's allowance when amendments are tabled on the matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill continues the incomes policy of the Government since it came to office, that is, that the biggest increases go to the wealthiest people and the smallest increases go to the poorest people. Between 1997, when the Government came to office, and 2001, for every £1 increase in social welfare rates, a person on the average industrial wage got £4.10, a person on a salary of £50,000 got £6.80 and someone on a salary of £100,000 got £9.80. That is what they received in tax cuts and does not include wage increases. This is obviously an unjust policy. It continues to widen the gap between rich and poor.</P>
      <P>In recent years there have been huge budget surpluses and this trend will continue this year. Unfortunately, most of these surpluses are used to give tax breaks to the rich. If poverty is to be tackled and eliminated, it must be done now while those surpluses exist. The Government must invest in eliminating poverty and disadvantage. Unfortunately, this Social Welfare Bill does not do that. We have heard the hype about increases in weekly payment rates as if they were significant, but many of the rates provided for in the Bill are significantly lower than the recommended poverty line rate, that is 50% of the average industrial wage of £102.16. Some of them are £18 per week less than the recommended poverty line rate. For instance, the disability allowance, widow's pension, non-contributory old age pension, supplementary welfare allowance and unemployment assistance are all significantly lower then the £102 per week recommended limit. While there are significant surpluses, it is only reasonable and fair that the Minister at least should aim to reach that £102 limit this year.</P>
      <P>I agree with the many commentators, including CORI, who have said that the budget and the Social Welfare Bill are fundamentally flawed because they betray the poorest sections in society and fail to honour the commitment given in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. If those commitments were implemented, social welfare increases of £14 per week for a single person and £24 per week for a couple would be required. The lowest rates are being increased in the Bill by £8 per week for a single person and £15 per week for a couple. Inflation, which has been persistently high, hits poor people hardest, yet they have received the least compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To raise all social welfare payments to the recommended poverty line income would have cost about an additional £150 million. That money could have been got in one of two ways, from the huge surpluses, which will continue again this year, or by not reducing the tax rate on higher incomes by 2% at a cost of £163 million. A sum of £150 million would have been sufficient <Col N="318" /> to increase the social welfare rates to which I referred by £14 and £24 respectively. I, like many people, do not know why the Government did not take the opportunity to do that.</P>
    <P>Providing that additional money would have made little or no difference to inflation, but it would have made a huge difference to people on low incomes. I challenge anyone in this House to live on rates of social welfare as low as £84 per week in the case of disability allowance and £89.10 per week in the case of widow's pension. The Government should take this opportunity to look again at these rates and increase them significantly, at least in line with the recommended poverty line limit to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Like many other speakers, I refer to the fact that the mobility allowance is being withdrawn from certain beneficiaries. The Minister said he is not responsible for this, but I would ask him to take this matter up with the Minister for Health and Children and the Cabinet. This is a particularly mean penny-pinching and discriminatory measure. There is only a small number of people involved and it would cost a very small amount of money to allow it to continue. These people are unable to walk and have no access to public transport. While they receive tax concessions for adapting their own private transport, in many cases they have raised funds, obtained loans from the credit union or received money from family members to make those alterations. This is a mean measure which should be re-examined and withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the qualified adult allowance, but it is not extended to those in receipt of unemployment assistance. It is particularly discriminatory towards women. This is an obvious omission and, despite the lip-service the Government pays towards supporting women who wish to return to the labour force, it does not recognise women in low income households who try to do so. The qualified adult allowance should be increased in line with the provision for disability allowance announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>Many Members referred to the fuel allowance and the fact that it has not been increased for years. While it has been extended for an additional three weeks this season, it is not adequate to provide for heating requirements, especially those of elderly people who need heating not just in the autumn and winter months, but throughout the year. The cost of doubling the fuel allowance would be about £37 million, a drop in the ocean compared with the huge budget surpluses of recent years and which we will have again this year. The Minister should examine this and increase the figure to £10 per week throughout the year.</P>
    <P>On carer's allowance, a disregard of £50 should be allowed before means are taken into account. Carers do their job every day of the week, every week of the year and are entitled to better than what was announced in the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the compliments to the Minister on the progress he has made in improving the position of what we loosely describe as the less well-off. He has been innovative and obtained the money to make vast improvements which must be compared with those provided for by the previous Administration, many of whose members have been vocal during the debate.</P>
      <P>Deputies Quinn and McDowell should keep their hands off the pension fund created by the Minister for Finance. We have been informed by commentators for the past ten to 15 years that pensions are a time bomb waiting to erupt. The Minister for Finance has made money available to counteract this. I compliment him on being one of the few to take steps from which he will not benefit in his time as a politician. Deputies Quinn and McDowell are threatening to tamper with the fund. They should keep their hands off it. The Labour Party takes money by way of a direct levy from the 40% to 50% of Fianna Fáil supporters who are trade unionists. The members of the Labour Party should, therefore, leave the pension fund alone because it is bad enough to take people's money while they work without tampering with their pensions as well.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the Irish in Britain. I was chairman of one of the three committees of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and we quickly identified this as an item which had to be dealt with. That was in 1989. I am concerned that we have not advanced as much as we should have. The Minister has a particular interest in this matter because of his geographical location and I encourage him to continue to try to help the people concerned in the United Kingdom who are down and out.</P>
      <P>As a former chairman of the Southern Health Board, I have listened for years to voluntary groups and health board officials complain about the lack of services for people with free travel passes who live in rural areas where there is no public transport. With his colleagues, will the Minister make it a priority to tackle this issue? Transport is important to the elderly, the handicapped and those who cannot avail of private transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has introduced the most innovative scheme about which we have heard since free travel was introduced, namely, the decision to make free schemes available to all those over the age of 70 years. I have identified one item on which I have tabled a parliamentary question. It should not be beyond the bounds of possibility for the Minister and the national broadcaster, RTE, to devise a scheme whereby those whose television licence is due to expire in March or April will receive a waiver of some description to allow them qualify for their free licence in May. <Col N="320" /> It would be desperate were they to be deprived of this facility for a year because they renewed their television licence a few weeks earlier than when the scheme came into effect. Will the Minister examine that matter? It may be a small item to some, but it is important for anyone over the age of 70 years. Those in the situation I have highlighted will be unfairly penalised.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about tackling poverty. When Fianna Fáil tackled poverty in years gone by, those who preach now about tackling poverty supported the various &ldquo;isms&rdquo; throughout Europe and centralised bureaucracy. Fianna Fáil tackled poverty not by treating people as a marketable commodity or categorising them using throwaway titles, but by treating them as individuals. Fianna Fáil is concerned about the less well-off and has proved this repeatedly. I commend the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>It was almost amusing to hear the Labour Party spokesperson seeking inflation proofing for social welfare payments. I was not a Member when Deputies Quinn and De Rossa, one more extreme left than the other, were in power, but the figures are available for the amount of money they gave the elderly, the poor, widows and others for whom crocodile tears have been shed during the debate. They did not do the job. They talk the talk now, but they did not walk the walk when they had the opportunity. They should get real. They should forget about picketing other political parties. They may oppose, by all means, but they should have delivered when they had the opportunity. They should not think that mentioning this as a historical fact will cut any ice. Only four years ago they had the opportunity and they did not deliver. The Minister is doing so and I compliment him on it. I appeal to him to keep up the good work on behalf of Fianna Fáil and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to echo what Deputy Dennehy said. When this Fianna Fáil led Administration took office it promised to combat social exclusion and marginalisation and to provide for the poor and needy. Those were some of the main issues on which Fianna Fáil fought the last election campaign. The Government has brought about change for the better in the social welfare area since coming to office, particularly under the stewardship of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern. I congratulate him on his success in this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister said yesterday that Ireland has changed dramatically for the better over the past four years and I endorse that comment. Fianna Fáil has increased spending on social welfare on a massive scale, from £4.5 billion in 1997 to more than £6 billion in 2001, a real increase of more than one third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997 the old age contributory pension was £78 per week and we promised to raise it to £100; we have done more, as the Bill provides for a pension rate of £106. Families are the main beneficiaries of the provisions in this Bill, as the <Col N="321" /> increases in budget 2001 apply in section 6 of this Bill and bring investment in child benefit in 2001 to £761 million, which is almost double the 1997 figure. This increase in child benefit is unprecedented and we on this side of the House should be rightly proud of that. The increases will help all parents with the costs of caring for their children and is a move towards ending child poverty. The Government recognises that child poverty leaves a legacy which persists into later life, as those who have had a poor childhood are more likely to have lower adult incomes. To end the cycle of poverty child poverty must be wiped out and this is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Section 7 increases the weekly income thresholds for family income support and section 12 provides for the payment of four additional weeks of maternity and adoptive benefits. New mothers will have an extra four weeks to spend with their new born infants or adopted children.</P>
    <P>The valuable role of carers is an irreplaceable one and no other Government has been as committed as this one to supporting carers. The budget contains several provisions which support carers and after my consultations with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance I see we have achieved a great deal, though they acknowledge that much more can and will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the money allocated to voluntary and community support groups as well as the Government's commitment to substantially increase a broad range of social welfare payments across the board. Personal rates of social welfare payments apart from those for older people are being increased by £8 per week, an increase of almost 10%. The increase in weekly payments will be paid from the first week in April and will coincide with the implementation of other income tax changes.</P>
    <P>Budget 2001 also provided for medical cards to be issued to people over 70. This means that anyone who heretofore had an RSI stoppage recorded on his or her pension slip will no longer have to pay that amount as they will now hold a medical card and the amount which was stopped was a health levy. That is another benefit.</P>
    <P>Budget 2001 goes further than any other budget in the history of the State with its social inclusion and £2,110 million is being provided for social inclusion measures, compared with the £525 million the rainbow coalition undertook to spend on similar measures. I congratulate the Minister and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all previous speakers, both party colleagues and Opposition Members. The latter have acknowledged that this legislation represents much progress. When a Social Welfare Bill contains an increase in spending of £850 million being in Opposition is difficult. Deputies Hayes and Broughan are full of promises but when they were in Government they did not deliver on any of the promises they had made, <Col N="322" /> nor did they come anywhere near the level of expenditure we have achieved. Despite what Deputy Hayes said, we have been able to do much in this area and put money aside. I echo Deputy Dennehy's comments on efforts by one Opposition party to, in effect, raid the old age pension fund for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael front bench in particular likes to ask questions but it is not too keen on answering them, as we have seen in relation to &ldquo;pollgate&rdquo; in recent days. Deputy Hayes proposed that increases in social welfare rates should exceed the estimated GNP growth in the economy. The public should be told if that is Fine Gael policy or just Deputy Hayes's youthful enthusiasm. Deputy Hayes does not want to pay for any of the substantial increases in the Bill because he opposes the prudent increases in PRSI charges for employers, which have to be seen in the context of much greater cuts in corporation tax.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan trotted out the usual Labour Party wish list and obviously there is more to come but the people will not believe the promises they are making in Opposition. The people remember the so-called socialists and so-called &ldquo;just society&rdquo; party when they were in office. Pensioners got a £1.50 increase and child benefit went up by £1 just a few years ago. Deputy Conor Lenihan hit the nail on the head when he said that when they were in Government they had the chance to effect big changes but they only gave social welfare recipients small change.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes referred to what he perceives as the widening poverty gap between rich and poor. The poverty proofing of the social welfare package carried out before the budget shows that half of the £850 million extra investment in the budget went to those on the very lowest level of income and that three quarters of all spending goes to the 50% of households on lower incomes. The increases, £10 for pensioners, £8 for all others, £12.90 for widows and the child benefit increases, are all in line with the National Anti-Poverty Strategy. Deputy Hayes referred to what he regarded as a mean-spirited and conservative approach by the Government in providing what he regards as a miserly increase of £8. I reject that.</P>
      <P>The increases we have given in this budget range from 10% to 18%, which is well above the expected rate of inflation of 4.5% and the expected rise of GNP of 8.5%. The cumulative increase in the lowest rates of payments in the last two budgets is 16.6%, well ahead of the projected level of inflation in that two year period. The Opposition cannot dispute this. A couple in receipt of unemployment assistance will receive a total weekly increase of £26.40 when the massive increase in child benefit is taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Members, rightly, referred to carers. I challenge any Member to ask any objective <Col N="323" /> observer to examine what has been done by the Government and compare it to what was done by previous Governments of different hues. No Government has achieved more than this Administration in respect of carers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not be so sure on that score.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, in the current budget alone we are increasing the amount of money available through carer's allowance scheme by £21 million. This will bring an additional 5,000 carers into the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case why are they arranging protest meetings?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result, the number on the scheme will have risen from 9,000 when we entered office to somewhere in the region of 22,000. During the three years when the rainbow coalition was in power only 4,200 additional carers where included in the scheme. We estimate that at the end of the year an extra 13,000 will qualify for carer's allowance as a result of the changes introduced in the budget.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan referred to the payment of budget increases from 1 January. It is obvious that he is concerned about this issue. The Deputy and his party had an opportunity to take action when in office, but nothing was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is in the process of bringing back the date of payment of increases to 1 January. When we entered office, increases were paid from the end of June, meaning that recipients only benefited for a 29 week period. The current budget ensures this period will be extended to 39 weeks and the next budget will extend it by a further 12 weeks when payments will be made from 1 January. A great deal of discussion has taken place in the Department regarding ways to implement this change in conjunction with the important changeover to the euro.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny referred to the public service card, an initiative similar to that of putting aside money for old age pensioners for which the parties in government will not receive a great deal of credit before the next general election. We are putting in place a huge infrastructure to facilitate the better delivery of services to the public. It is for this reason the public service card is being introduced. Deputy Kenny inquired about the future uses of the card. The measures we are putting in place will ensure those who access the public services offered by a range of Government agencies and Departments will benefit greatly from the introduction of the new card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGrath referred to the alignment of the income tax and calendar years and made a <Col N="324" /> number of allegations in respect of what is being done. The overall effect of the changes will benefit the people. From 2001, the employee annual earnings ceiling will be increased by £1,750. There will be a transitional year because of the shorter financial year that will result from the alignment to which Deputy McGrath referred. The overall effect will be that there will be a delay in the commencement of the PRSI holiday period by nine months on an ongoing basis. Contributors will not lose out as a result of the alignment process. He or she will have two holiday periods, one in each of the calendar years 2001 and 2002. The only change will be the period in which the holiday comes into effect. I reject the Deputy's statement on that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan referred to a blanket refusal on the Government's part to individualise social welfare payments. No other Minister has said more than I about the need to individualise social welfare payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Broughan is aware, some of his colleagues in the trade unions are part of the PPF under which there is a process to introduce administrative individualisation. I wanted to go further than that, however, and in this budget I have taken steps to increase the level of the QAA to the full old age non-contributory pension rate by providing for special increases of £15 in the allowance payable to qualified adults over the age of 66 years. I have no doubt that Deputy Broughan, like every other Member, will be delighted in April when couples on old age pension will receive increases ranging between £20 and £25 as a result of the changes we have made. We will continue in the next budget to grant special increases in respect of the allowance payable to qualified adults over 66 years of age.</P>
      <P>Members raised a number of other issues, but I do not have time to deal with them. I wish to refer, however, to the matter raised by Deputy Fitzgerald, namely, the need to backdate the homemaker's scheme to the years prior to 1994. I have stated on many occasions that there is a need to reconsider the position <i>vis-à-vis </i>this scheme. An examination of the possibility of extending the scheme is ongoing. This issue is high on my list of priorities.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have had the opportunity to bring forward my fourth Social Welfare Bill. Deputy Hayes tried to make a good fist of coming to terms with his new portfolio in terms of his contribution to the debate. I wish him well in his new position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the proper management of the economy by the Government in the past four years, we have achieved an amazing turnaround in fortunes. Deputies on the opposite side of the House claimed that we are not responsible for creating the current economic climate and that <Col N="325" /> this was done during the period 1994 to 1997 when their parties were in power. If that is the case, why did they only give old age pensioners an increase of £1.80 and an increase of only £1 in the last budget they introduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall position in relation to hous<Col N="327" /> ing output and leading indicators was positive in 2000, whether we look at total housing output, HomeBond registrations, progress in relation to serviced land availability or planning permissions.</P>
      <P>HomeBond registrations, which are a leading indicator of private new housing starts, last year totalled 34,600 units, up more than 2% on the 1999 total. Almost 50,000 housing units were completed last year, an increase of 7% on 1999 and the sixth consecutive year of record housing output. Other leading indicators of housing output, such as planning permissions and availability of serviced land, are also positive. Some 86,500 housing units received planning permission in 2000, an increase of 13% on 1999.</P>
      <P>Local area plans were adopted in Dublin during 2000 for a significant number of key sites and the stock of serviced residential building land available is encouraging and is set to improve. There is currently 4,500 acres of zoned serviced land in Dublin, which could provide more than 67,000 housing units, and a further 3,500 acres of zoned serviced land in the Mid-East Region with an estimated yield of about 28,500 housing units.</P>
      <P>The housing supply measures put in place by this Government, in servicing land and alleviating bottlenecks in the planning system, are clearly having the desired effect. Further measures, including the designation of strategic development zones for residential development, completion of local authority housing strategies and pro-active recruitment of construction professionals, should have similar positive effects. In tandem with my Department's housing supply unit, a cross-departmental team on housing has been established to ensure the urgent implementation of key water, sewerage and roads infrastructure projects necessary to maximise housing output over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that output rose last year in the housing sector, although it was slower in the cities where demand is greatest. I am concerned about the consistent drop in recent months in registrations, which are a better indicator of what is about to happen as opposed to what has happened in the past. Is the Minister concerned that the level and type of interference, both by way of regulations and by way of fiscal measures, are working against increasing the supply of housing? There is evidence which we read about regularly in the papers that the two-year life span of a planning permission is introducing huge uncertainty for builders, particularly small builders who feel they cannot comply and are leaving the sector. Also, the banks are reluctant to give financing for housing in these circumstances. The requirement for 20% in relation to social housing seems to be introducing uncertainty. I support the social objectives of that, but it does not increase supply, and it shifts the cost of social housing from the State where it always rested to the first time buyer in the same estate. That increases the cost to first time buyers to the <Col N="328" /> point where it is it is pushed beyond their means, particularly in Dublin and other major cities. Would the Minister agree there is now considerable anecdotal evidence to suggest that traditional builders are leaving not just the sector but the country and building in Belfast, Great Britain and Spain where there seems to be greater certainty, rather than here where they simply cannot produce houses that the buyer can afford?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amazing, if the builders are leaving the country, that we are managing to achieve an increased level of housing output &ndash;  50,000 houses last year &ndash; and that 86,500 planning permissions were granted last year. Why would I have gone to the bother of going through the whole system to obtain permission with that development. There is evidence of continuing strong demand into the future for housing. The building industry is working at full capacity and extraneous measures are being taken to attract construction professionals to assist in achieving even higher levels.</P>
      <P>A change was made in respect of HomeBond registrations last year which had the effect of bringing registrations forward early in the year. This resulted from the issuing of a circular by HomeBond in December 1999 informing its members that developments must be registered before work begins on a site so that foundation inspections can be made, and that a penalty would be applied in cases of late registration. Prior to that many, developments were registered only at the mid-construction stage. Thus, the Deputy is not really comparing like with like given that the threat of a penalty brought forward a large number of registrations. However, we are keeping the situation under review because we would be concerned if there was evidence of the trend suggested by the Deputy, but there is not any hard evidence.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the social housing requirement of 20%. That is not yet in operation. Housing strategies have yet to be completed by local authorities and development plans amended to take account of the housing strategies. It is not, therefore, having a major impact at the moment. I accept that many of the measures designed to increase the construction of new houses aimed particularly at the first time buyer require much thought on the part of developers in order that they may focus their building programmes where the biggest social need exists.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a private residential tenancies board was one of the recommendations of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector and the board will be established on an <i>ad-hoc</i> basis by this autumn.</P>
      <P>New legislation will be needed to establish the board on a statutory basis. The proposed legislation will also grant to a tenant, whose tenancy has not been terminated in the first six months, a right to continue in occupation for the remainder of a four year period, unless the landlord needs to recover possession for specified reasons. Revised notice to quit requirements will range from a minimum of four weeks &ndash; 28 days &ndash; to a maximum of 16 weeks &ndash; 112 days &ndash; in each four-year period.</P>
      <P>The legislation will provide that rents may be no greater than the market rate and reviews may occur no more frequently than once a year, unless there is a substantial change to the nature of the accommodation before the review date.</P>
      <P>Drafting of the legislation is a complex task involving detailed and ongoing collaboration between two Government Departments, a highly complex and integrated legislative code, involving the amendment, in respect of residential tenancies, of many of the provisions in existing landlord and tenant acts going back to the 1860 legislation; detailed consideration of court judgments and legal precedents in a highly complex area, distinguishing between the impacts on the residential and commercial rented sectors and setting up a completely separate code for the rented residential sector.</P>
      <P>This task will be undertaken by my Department in collaboration with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has responsibility for the landlord and tenant legislative code. We are committed to completing this work as quickly as possible, but at this stage I consider the two-year time frame a realistic one in the light of the complexity and detail of the legislation required and the normal time requirement for the passage of legislation through the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national spatial strategy is currently being prepared in my <Col N="332" /> Department under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>Following an initial round of public consultation last year, my Department completed and published a report on the scope of the strategy, setting out the issues and challenges it needed to address and a work programme to ensure its delivery by the end of this year. This was followed by a period of extensive research during which a wide range of issues, relating <i>inter alia</i> to population and labour force projections, the future role of Dublin in Ireland and Europe, urban and rural functioning, factors driving the location of enterprise, quality of life issues, infrastructure and environmental protection, were analysed and assessed.</P>
      <P>Based on that information, my Department is preparing a series of policy option papers setting out the most realistic choices and opportunities open to us to promote new patterns of development in Ireland over the next 20 years. The policy papers will be published during the first half of May. Their publication will be followed over the rest of May and June by an intense period of consultation with regional and local interests, the social partners, sustainable development partners and other representative groups. Following that, and taking account of the responses and views received during the consultation phase, the proposals for inclusion in the strategy itself will be further developed, with a view to having the strategy submitted to the Government for approval in late autumn and published by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The strategy is not simply about picking specific centres and directing infrastructural investment to them. Its overall objectives are to promote balanced regional development, while improving the quality of life, maintaining and enhancing the quality of our natural and cultural heritage and sustaining economic development. Of particular importance, therefore, among the many issues which the strategy must address are: the future role of Dublin as a European capital city region; ensuring that the region grows in a way which is in greater equilibrium with other regions; inter-relationships between urban areas of different sizes and rural areas; spatial implications of future structural changes in agriculture; ways in which the potential within different regions can be developed; proposals for improved North-South co-ordination and co-operation on regional development and spatial planning issues; mechanisms for better integration of different sectoral policies; the role of energy and technology; urban growth patterns and the need for special policies on coastal zones and other high amenity areas.</P>
      <P>While designated gateways and infrastructural issues will be important elements within the strategy, it will be clear from the issues I have mentioned that they will only be part of the response to a wide range of challenges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is a bit daft to draw up a national development plan <Col N="333" /> to invest billions of pounds throughout the country and, after that investment has begun to flow, to begin an examination of where the investment should have been made? It is easy to envisage a situation where much of what is happening under the NDP will prove to be inappropriate investment when the spatial plan is available or at least not consistent with the objectives of the plan. I appreciate that the spatial plan involves more than identifying the major centres but we need not know the future of every hamlet in Ireland to establish the major centres so we can direct the major infrastructural changes towards those areas now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as daft to take the route chosen by the Government as it is to issue policy documents selecting towns or cities and discussing spatial planning around them. The open consultative approach we are adopting to the national spatial strategy, which, after all, will have profound effects on this country over the next 20 to 40 years, is the proper way to proceed. Much of the research for the national development plan is being fed into the national spatial strategy. I do not anticipate, as the Deputy appears to, that the national spatial strategy will be in conflict with the national development plan. However, there is provision in the national development plan for a review of the plan. The national spatial strategy will be available at the end of this year and the review takes place in 2003. If there are any surprises or if major changes are required in the national development plan as a result of the national spatial strategy, we will be able to accommodate them at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Time is of the essence. Achieving the objectives of a spatial plan in a free enterprise economy depends on strong economic growth and on population growth. The indications are that the economy is peaking. Is there not a danger that unless the spatial plan is implemented immediately or that we at least have some idea of where we are going, it will remain aspirational for years until we again have another cycle of economic growth? The Minister will be aware of what happened in the case of Dublin. Three new towns were planned but it took 30 years for the necessary investment to follow the population. That is what will happen to regional balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a greater danger of making a mess of it if we rush into a half-baked plan and just select four or five potential cities. The Government is adopting the correct approach to the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the EU-funded Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-99, £7.1 million in grant assistance was allocated in respect of 70 projects for the provision of recycling infrastructure in the period since January 1997. This does not take account of local authority capital and operational expenditure in support of recycling initiatives.</P>
      <P>Based on information then arising from the waste management planning process, it was estimated for the purposes of the national development plan that £650 million in capital investment would be required to provide necessary waste infrastructure in the period to 2006. More recent information on capital investment projections in waste management plans indicates an estimated capital investment requirement of £780 million at 1998-99 prices. Facilities associated with recycling and biological treatment account for approximately £215 million or 28% of this figure. Operational costs associated with the provision of waste management services by the private and public sectors are also likely to be significant.</P>
      <P>Having provided for extensive segregation and separate collection of dry recyclable and organic wastes and maximum achievable recycling and biological treatment of wastes, existing and proposed regional waste management plans identify a requirement for five to six thermal treatment facilities to recover energy from waste which cannot otherwise be treated before landfill.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that the current waste management planning process is brought to a satisfactory conclusion as a matter of urgency in order that immediate progress can be made in the delivery of improved waste services and the integrated infrastructure necessary to meet modern waste management requirements. I have considered all available options and I am satisfied that further statutory measures are necessary. Accordingly, I will bring forward appropriate measures in the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001, which will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to act on this matter in order that the good work done in the past three years towards the implementation of a sustainable waste policy, with high emphasis on prevention, minimisation and recycling, as well as suitable treatment and disposal options, will be brought to fruition.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the implementation of the Litter Act, 1997; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that local authorities have significantly stepped up anti-litter action since 1997. For example, in the period January 1997 to June 2000 the number of litter wardens more than trebled, prosecutions increased more than sevenfold and on-the-spot fines increased from less than 1,000 to over 15,000. Full statistical details on local authority litter performance are in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Despite these and other improvements, much remains to be done. Reflecting this fact, last week the Minister and I published a litter action plan. This is a comprehensive national strategy to tackle litter, responding to the report of the National Anti-Litter Forum which we also published. Copies of the plan and report have been circulated to Deputies and are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>One of the key measures in the plan is to provide for further intensification of local authority anti-litter action. We are asking local elected members to play a full part in this process. We wish to see improved enforcement, particularly from those local authorities whose performances are lagging behind. We also wish to see local authorities learning from each other and achieving best practice, including in the important area of education and awareness.</P>
      <P>Guidance on litter management plans, a new website and greater use of indicators of local authority performance will all help to achieve this aim. There will also be initiatives to provide more training and flexibility in the litter warden service and local authorities will be encouraged to engage more widely in local anti-litter partnerships.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said he is satisfied with the implementation of the Litter Act. It is obvious, however, when one looks around the country that it is not being enforced. If it was enforced in its entirety, we would not have such a litter problem. I am aware of the Government's recent announcement and have a copy of the report published by the forum. It recommended that fines should be increased, but there is no reference in public statements to how it will be enforced. How does the Minister of State intend to enforce its recommendations? How many local authorities have a full-time litter warden? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the progress made and pay tribute to the many local authorities which are proactive in terms of the litter problem. There is no doubt that much work <Col N="338" /> must be done. Some local authorities are not as active as I would like. The Deputy and I have been working at local level to create awareness and involve local authorities in a more positive way. This problem is not easy to resolve. We want a multi-sectoral approach to it. The litter action plan, announced last week, will give greater powers to local authorities. As there have been complaints about the fine of £1,500 for a summary offence, we intend to increase it to £100,000. Members know of people who indiscriminately dump litter. It is to their advantage to dump it and pay the £1,500 fine. That is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the many local authorities which are active in this area. The Minister and I have travelled the country and it is great to go to a place where the local authorities, communities and schools are taking a proactive approach to the litter problem. We do not have a magic wand. We must realise that this problem is everyone's responsibility. Local authorities are charged with enforcement. Too often the finger is pointed at the Minister, but we are giving power to the local authorities. I appeal to local authority members to get on with the job and ensure their litter management plans are enforced in local areas.</P>

We recognise that supply is the real solution to what is happening in the market place. All efforts must be devoted to seeking to increase the level of supply to match the level of demand, and in that way to take some of the real heat out of the marketplace which is taking advantage of the situation in current circumstances.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 7, 112 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen reports of claims of an increased incidence of illegal evictions from private rented accommodation in the Dublin area. The rights of tenants of such accommodation and the protection available to them are, in the first place, governed by the terms of the lease or other tenancy agreement under which the tenancies are held. These are subject to the provisions of the landlord and tenant code which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand statistics on the number of evictions from private rented dwellings are not kept by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government proposals for major reforms in the private rented residential sector, arising from the recommendations of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector, were announced on 5 January. These reforms include improved security of tenure arrangements and the establishment of a private rented residential tenancies board to deal primarily with disputes between landlords and tenants. In the case of security of tenure, it is proposed to grant a tenant whose tenancy has not been terminated in the first six months, a right to continue in occupation for the remainder of a four-year period, unless the landlord needs to recover possession for specified reasons, such as for own or family member occupation, to sell or to redevelop. Successive four-year tenancy periods are envisaged, during the first six months of each of which the tenancy may be terminated without cause. A graduated notice to quit period related to the length of tenancy will apply ranging from a minimum of four <Col N="342" /> weeks to a maximum of 16 weeks. In addition, rent levels will be no greater than market rent, and reviews will normally take place no more than once a year.</P>
    <P>The implementation of these provisions will result in a major step forward for the private rented residential sector with improved security of tenure for tenants and greater certainty for landlords. Work is now commencing on a collaborative basis with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on the preparation of legislation to give statutory effect to these proposals. Pending the enactment of the legislation, arrangements are being made for the establishment of the board on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by the autumn.</P>

      <P>According to Threshold, 341 unfortunate tenants were evicted illegally &ndash; I am not talking about legal evictions &ndash; by their landlords in the last year. Is the Minister seriously saying it will take another two years for legislation to be introduced to provide them with some protection? What immediate steps will the Minister take to deal with illegal evictions? There are cases where landlords bully tenants out of property without due process, either by turning off the electricity, cutting off water, intimidation and various other bully boy tactics. Will the Minister do anything to provide protection for those tenants? </P>

The landlord and tenant legislation is traditionally the responsibility of another Department. That Department and my Department are working together to bring about an improved situation for tenants. The Deputy mentioned the number of people who, allegedly, have been evicted. That is a matter for another Department.</P>

A period of two years was mentioned, but all of us in Opposition would be quite prepared to support these measures now if the Minister was to bring them before the House. The Minister is dawdling on the issue. Why has there been such an excessive delay? We are going back to the case of Mespil House in my constituency where this issue arose before. We had a commission investigating that matter and now we have another commission. How many more commissions and recommendations will we have before the Minister acts?</P>

      <P>It is not satisfactory to me that it will take some time to prepare the legislation. I want to see the results of my requests to the commission, and the result of its work, implemented as quickly as possible. I have sought the best advice available to me. I understand it will take quite a length of time to go back to legislation dating from 1860, and to separate legislation covering commercially rented property from residential property. It is the first time we have done that. It will involve the enactment of a complex, integrated legislative code involving significant amendments in respect of residential tenancies to many of the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts going back to 1860, and the setting up of a completely separate code for residential property. Work has commenced on a collaborative basis between this Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the preparation of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>On 4 January, I wrote to local authority managers about the matter of staff engaging in activities which were incompatible with their official roles. I asked managers to check the position in relation to the local authorities for which they were responsible and to report on the outcome of this exercise within three months. I asked for confirmation at that stage that the managers were now satisfied that no member of staff was currently involved in private activities which were incompatible with his or her official role.

      <P>I requested it and gave them three months to make a report on both aspects.

I also asked them, as part of that report, to confirm at that time &ndash; when they submit the report &ndash; that nobody is currently involved in private activities.

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to make another statement when he receives these reports? From the point of view of how local authorities work, it is terribly important that the Minister should bring closure to this issue in order to restore the public's confidence in local authorities, which the Minister must be aware has been completed decimated. It is also important to ensure these practices are not going on and to restore the good name of the many good employees in local authorities throughout the country who are not only distressed but totally demoralised by this. It is a sector in which it is extraordinarily difficult to retain staff. It is up to the Minister not only to ask for a report but to act on it to bring closure to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope when I get these reports I will be able to bring closure to this issue. I have not made up my mind on how to do that. I agree with the Deputy that very many of the staff are not engaged in any activities that contravene the guidelines or the professional code of conduct. I made that precise point in my statement on 4 January. I said it was necessary not only to ensure that any malpractices are unearthed but to protect the reputation of the very many local authority officials who discharge their duties with integrity.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy it is important that we try to bring closure to this issue. A number of local authorities are investigating a number of matters that have been brought to our attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell and the Minister that it is important this matter should be brought to closure and that the reputation and integrity of the overwhelming majority <Col N="346" /> of staff in local authorities is reassured and reaffirmed. Has the Minister given any thought to the Comptroller and Auditor General having a possible role regarding the accountability of local authorities or to some mechanism whereby, at a general level, this House might have some role in regard to accountability in that area?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Gilmore's question, I gave some thought to the Comptroller and Auditor General having a role in making local authorities accountable to this House, but I dismissed that idea, as local authorities, unlike many other bodies, are democratically elected. The manager and staff of local authorities are accountable to directly elected representatives. There is not a role for the Comptroller and Auditor General in that area, but there is a separate independent audit service for local government, which was confirmed by my predecessor. That service was strengthened by way of audit committees in the local government Bill.</P>
      <P>As to what I was aware of when I initiated that inquiry, Deputy Clune may recall a major issue arose at that time concerning engineers in Roscommon and that matter became public. Prior to that I had given approval to the dismissal of an engineer in Donegal on foot of a complaint. There were newspaper reports in relation to Kerry around the same time and at that stage I decided I had to bring a focus on this issue to try to bring some closure to it.</P>
      <P>What was Deputy Gormley's question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was about a member of the public who became aware of malpractice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If a member of the public is concerned about a matter involving a member of the staff of a local authority, that person should report the matter to the manager of the local authority, as he or she has responsibility for this area. If it was matter of corruption in which the manager was involved, it should be brought to the attention of the Garda, but in some cases where people have had such complaints, they have brought it to my attention or to the attention of the Department and it has been dealt with accordingly. In some cases an official of the Department may be appointed to hear both sides of the story. If the complaint appeared to have substance and was serious, it would generally be submitted to the Garda. If it involved a case of corruption, I have said in the past, it might be suitable to bring such a matter to the attention of <Col N="347" /> the Flood tribunal, which is investigating planning matters.</P>

      <P>I have received a lengthy letter, dated 13 October 2000, from the Environmental Directorate of the European Commission, which provided an analysis of complaints received by the Commission from the public in Ireland. This is part of an ongoing exchange of views with the Commission, which I initiated last year, in relation to implementation and enforcement of Community legislation in Ireland, including the handling of complaints received by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The correspondence recognised improvements made by Ireland in the implementation of Com<Col N="348" /> munity directives and offered a number of observations on possibilities for reducing numbers of complaints and or refining the roles of the relevant authorities involved. It was not suggested that the Irish authorities were not complying adequately with the Commission on environmental issues.</P>
    <P>The most recent Commission report on the monitoring of Community legislation, published in June 2000 confirmed that at 31 December 1999 in the environment area Ireland had implemented 96.6% of environment related directives. There are more than 200 separate pieces of EU. legislation relating to the environment.</P>
    <P>It is my Department's policy to respond as promptly as practicable to correspondence from the Commission in relation to environmental matters.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement of the position concerning infringements and complaints currently notified.</P>
    <P>While my Department has responded to the Commission in recent months on a range of specific issues, and maintained contacts with the Environment Directorate, a comprehensive reply will issue to the letter of 13 October last on completion of consultations with the range of other Departments and agencies directly concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 15, 20, 34 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>Meaningful and comprehensive planning is a key prerequisite to improved waste management performance, and considerable effort has been devoted at national, regional and local level to delivering effective results. From the outset local authorities were encouraged to adopt a regional approach to the planning process with a view to the more efficient and cost-effective provision of services and infrastructure. The great majority of authorities subsequently committed themselves to the making of joint, mainly regional, waste management plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, 30 local authorities with waste management planning responsibilities have decided to adopt relevant local or regional waste management plans. Certain of these decisions were, however, subject to significant qualifications. Individual authorities in three different regions <Col N="354" /> have not adopted the proposed regional plans. No date has been prescribed for the completion of the planning process.</P>
    <P>I have legal advice to the effect that a regional plan must be adopted on the same basis by all the local authorities concerned. Failure to adopt a regional plan by one or more of the authorities concerned or its adoption subject to substantive variation or qualification means that the overall plan cannot be considered validly adopted by any authority involved, that is, there would be no regional plan.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the current waste management planning process is brought to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible in order that progress can be made in the delivery of improved waste services and the integrated infrastructure necessary to meet our waste management requirements. A further delay in making sensible long-term provision for the waste management needs of the regions concerned is untenable. I have, accordingly, considered all the available options to bring the planning process to an early and satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the existing powers under the Waste Management Act, 1996, to formally require specified authorities jointly to make such a waste plan, prescribe a date by which all such plans must be made and give a general policy direction to local authorities regarding the content of such plans would not in themselves be adequate to ensure a satisfactory and timely outcome. I intend, accordingly, to bring forward new legislative proposals in a forthcoming Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001, which will shortly be submitted to Government for approval and publication. The Bill will also include other legislative provisions on waste considered necessary at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the legislative proposals include a measure to allow county managers or senior local authority officers to adopt a waste plan if local authority members do not agree such a plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated earlier, when I annoyed the Deputy greatly, I do not propose to go into the details of the legislation until it has been finalised by Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that we must wait until the Bill is introduced in the House before it can be considered, but the Minister has announced that he intends to take certain legislative measures in respect of the drafting of waste management plans. It is reasonable to ask him to inform the House in general terms what are his plans. There is a waste crisis. It is a controversial issue in many areas. Members and the public are entitled to know what legislative direction the Minister intends to take. Where will he go with this legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the purpose of the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I made it clear in my reply to these questions and the previous question that the purpose of the legislation is to bring the planning process in terms of waste management to a conclusion in order that we can commence the implementation of waste management plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of aggravation about waste management facilities such as landfills, recycling plants or incinerators. Is it not critical to have information on what is happening to waste? I recently tabled a parliamentary question about what happens to waste which businesses are required to retain on their premises for recycling for four weeks if they are not participating in a recycling scheme. The Minister replied that he did not have the information. Such information, on a regional basis, is critical to ascertaining the demand for waste disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the more information available on waste and waste streams the better. Certain general information is available through the EPA on waste streams, but the detail which the Deputy sought in her parliamentary question was not available. It is important to have as much information as possible. Every Member is aware of the levels of waste outlined in the recent EPA report. These levels are growing. We have a poor recycling infrastructure in which we need to invest. The only way to tackle the problem is through proper planning, not knee-jerk reactions.</P>
      <P>Although proper plans have been drafted, they are being held up by a number of local authorities. It is imperative that we move from planning stage to implementation stage. When implementation stage is reached it should be much easier to obtain the information referred to by the Deputy. We need to reach implementation stage quickly.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the Paul Daniels and Walter Mitty solutions. His is the Tommy Cooper solution, as he tries to make waste disappear, but he makes a mess of it every time. He insists on building incinerators when Ludwig Kramer of the waste management unit of the European Union is stating that no new incinerators will be built in most EU member states, nor in the United States, New Zealand or Australia as incineration is seen in similar terms to nuclear power. Why is the Minister proceeding with a discredited technology?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are lies, damn lies and statistics, not to mention half truths. Mr. Kramer made that comment when asked how the public in some EU member states viewed incineration. <Col N="356" /> It is easy to understand the reason the Irish public views it in the same way given the scare tactics being employed by the Green Party, Sinn Féin and others.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union, which does not waste time, decided less than two years ago to put a new incineration directive in place. Deputies Gormley and Sargent wanted it to be written into the Waste Management Act, 1996, passed when Deputy Howlin was Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The aim of the Government is to promote a local government system which is democratically based, strong, relevant, properly financed and working in partnership with the community it serves. The major programme of renewal under way is designed to underpin this objective. The Local Government Bill, 2000, is an intrinsic component of this ongoing process and will<i> inter alia</i> provide the statutory framework for the many initiatives in train and significantly enhance the role of the elected council.</P>
      <P>The Bill will provide the council with the necessary framework, support and backup to make, steer and oversee policy development in a consistent way which can address the often difficult and sometimes unpopular choices facing local authorities and will replace the current management Acts. The introduction of strategic policy committees will place members at the heart of policy development from the early stages and involve relevant sectoral interests with proper back up from new directors of service. As each elected member will be represented on at least one SPC and the whole council is the ultimate decision making body, elected members will have the duty and opportunity for in-depth involvement in policy, development and review.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a salary type payment and pension arrangements will provide practical support for councillors in this work. Likewise a major training and information initiative has commenced for cathaoirligh and SPC chairs and will soon extend to all members. The Bill provides a key role for the corporate policy group comprising the cathaoirleach and SPC chairs. This will give the cathaoirleach a central role in key corporate policy areas such as the annual budget, the corporate plan for the life of the council and overview of SPC operations. Specifically, the draft budget must be prepared in consultation with the corporate policy group which may avail of outside expertise for this purpose. Similar arrangements will apply in the preparation of the corporate plan. The cathaoirleach in his or her own right has access to all information, may require deferral of executive action by the manager and may convene meetings of the council at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These changes are coupled with new arrangements for counties and cities to provide for a cathaoirleach who is democratically elected by direct vote of the people for a five year term and will thus have the opportunity to act as a real community leader accountable to the council and the community and who can ensure policy prop<Col N="359" /> erly developed and adopted by the council is implemented by the executive. The cathaoirleach with a powerful democratic mandate will chair the corporate policy group and the county or city development board and is in a strong position to bring together the various interests and agencies to promote the economic and social development of the county or city. Experience elsewhere bears this out.</P>
    <P>These and other interlinked measures such as improved funding, modern financial management systems, promotion of better efficiencies and customer service along with a range of mechanisms to oversee the direction of local authority business and the operation of the executive will, if taken up and worked fully, provide the opportunity and responsibilities for the elected council to reclaim its rightful place at the heart of local government and local communities in a modern society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if the new chairmen or mayors will have more power than the county manager? What current powers will the county managers lose? Will the County Management (Amendment) Act, 1942, be repealed? What will be the balance of power between the new chairman and the elected members of the council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a counterbalance between the manager and the directly elected members of the local authority in the form of the chairman, who will act in conjunction with the members. Two models can be adopted &ndash; the two models are the American one where the elected official directs the chief executive, or this one where a directly elected chairman works alongside the manager ensuring that the decisions of the members are executed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to inform the House of the Commission's proposals for the reform of the beef regime, and to deal with the foot and mouth disease issue. The proposals, and I emphasise that they are only proposals, were adopted by the Commission last week and will be discussed in the Agriculture Council for the first time on Monday 26 February. The background is the BSE crisis which erupted in a number of member states last November and has led to a substantial reduction in beef consumption within the Community and the loss of third country markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I comment on the proposals I will outline them in general terms. First, it is proposed that the special beef premium quota be converted into an individual producer quota subject to regional limits based on payments made in one of the years 1997 to 2000, whichever is the highest, plus 3%. National reserves etc. amounting to <Col N="361" /> between 1% and 3% are to be set up. The Commission estimates that this will reduce the number of male animals qualifying for the SBP by 9% and will save &ndash; 178 million per year. The option currently available to member states to waive the 90 head limit is to be removed.</P>
    <P>Second, on suckler cow premium, the 20% heifer facility is to be amended to require producers to submit heifers for at least 20% of their suckler cows quota. The option would be increased to 40%. It is also proposed that unused suckler premium rights be frozen in the period 2002-04.</P>
    <P>Third, the stocking density limit for the suckler cow premium and the special beef premium is to be reduced from 2.0 lu/ha to 1.8 lu/ha. Fourth, the ceiling of 350,000 tonnes p.a. on sales into intervention is to be abolished for 2001 and 2002 in order to avoid recourse to safety net intervention.</P>
    <P>The Commission intends to replace the purchase for destruction scheme with a special purchase scheme to run until the end of the year. The main difference between the new scheme and the old is that member states can store beef for eventual distribution as food aid, or free food to the poorer sections of the community, or to destroy the beef as under the purchase for destruction scheme. This proposal circumvents the ethical problems many member states have with destroying healthy beef. Whatever one thinks about the Commission's proposals, effective measures are needed at EU level to re-balance the beef market.</P>
    <P>We are in the middle of an unprecedented crisis. There is major reduction in beef consumption in European markets. The Commission's estimate is that consumption has fallen by 30% since the beginning of the crisis last November and that consumption for 2001 as a whole will be down by 10-12% on last year's level. A large proportion of our third country markets have been lost temporarily. Given the dependence of the Irish beef industry on export markets, both within and outside the European Union, effective measures must be taken to restore balance in the market. Otherwise, the current market difficulties will continue indefinitely and Irish producers will suffer.</P>
    <P>This is not to say we are prepared to accept the Commission's proposals as they are currently presented. I have difficulties because they do not include any effective supply control measure and, to the extent that such measures are proposed, they are targeted at the suckler herd. This would have a disproportionate impact on Ireland.</P>
    <P>Individualisation of the special beef premium quota will not achieve much except additional bureaucracy and the introduction of impediments to inter-farm trade. The proposed reduction in the special beef premium quota is also unacceptable. I welcome the proposal to remove the intervention ceiling for 2001 and 2002. The scale of the problem means it will be necessary to purchase substantial quantities of beef for the next two years. The abolition of the ceiling is to <Col N="362" /> prevent prices falling into the safety net. The proposed replacement by the PDS is welcome as it ensures an even spread of the burden. Only a few states implement it meaning it is less effective in removing the surplus. The burden is being borne by France and us. That it is unfair. The efforts of the Commission to involve all member states in the scheme are welcome.</P>
    <P>I am alarmed at the proposal to exclude steers. I took this up with Commissioner Fischler. We would suffer more than any other State. The calf processing scheme was effective and ought to be reintroduced, although many States are opposed to it on ethical and animal welfare grounds. In addition, it is a mechanism to ensure that member states, where beef comes predominantly from the dairy herd, make a reasonable contribution to the supply control effort.</P>
    <P>While the Commission's most recent proposals concentrate on eliminating the new beef surplus through supply control and intervention type measures, I emphasise that the best long-term solution is to restore consumer confidence in beef and secure the re-opening of those third country markets which have been closed.</P>
    <P>While the Commission's most recent proposals concentrate on eliminating the new beef surplus through supply control and intervention type measures, I emphasise that the best long-term solution is to restore consumer confidence in beef and secure the re-opening of third country markets that have been closed. The measures taken at EU level in relation to the ban on meat and bonemeal, the extension of the SRM list and the introduction of rapid BSE testing are all designed to restore and achieve these objectives and allay consumer concerns. In addition, I have pressed the Commissioner for an increase in export refunds which would facilitate exports to third countries.</P>
    <P>Measures are needed to rebalance the beef market, but I disagree with the measures that have been proposed and their form. The Commission's proposals are not fair or equitable between member states and I will seek to have the balance redressed in the negotiations that begin next Monday.</P>
    <P>Foot and mouth disease &ndash; FMD &ndash; is on the minds of everybody involved with the agri-food sector today. The outbreak in the UK of FMD is of great concern. An outbreak of the disease in Ireland would have the potential to cause enormous economic damage to our agriculture and food processing sectors and would have far-reaching implications for our export markets. There has not been a case of FMD in Ireland since 1941. This has been due to the manner in which we responded to outbreaks elsewhere in Europe in the intervening years, most notably in the UK in 1981 and on a much more extensive scale in 1967. There is a clear understanding among all concerned with our agriculture and food processing sectors of the threat posed by FMD. I stress that if the disease spread to Ireland, the consequences would not be confined <Col N="363" /> to these sectors alone, but would permeate the entire economy. We must remember that we only consume approximately 10% of what is produced. The enormity of the problem, if it occurred, should not be underestimated by anybody.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, determined that we should respond to the situation as effectively as in the past and that every necessary measure should be taken to prevent the spread of the disease from the UK to this country. While particular responsibility will be imposed on those involved in farming and the food sector, I stress that the full commitment and co-operation of the entire population will be necessary if we are to succeed in our efforts. This should be seen as nothing less than a national issue that has the potential to adversely affect, either directly or indirectly, the well-being of everyone in the country. Our response must reflect the gravity of the situation.</P>
    <P>Within hours of being notified of the FMD outbreak in the UK, my Department had moved swiftly to put in place the first wave of protective measures. First and foremost we introduced an immediate ban on the importation from the UK, including Northern Ireland, of cattle, sheep, pigs and goats and of meat, meat products, milk and milk products. I pay tribute to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the alacrity with which it approached this serious matter. It provided the wherewithal to do what was necessary at short notice. Arrangements were put into effect in Border areas last evening and they will be further consolidated today. Last evening, the EU Commission imposed a ban on the export from the UK, including Northern Ireland&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is currently drawing up guidelines for the public and retail outlets indicating what is necessary at present. My Department is maintaining extremely close contact with the relevant authorities in the North on an hourly basis. The chief veterinary officers in the North and the South are working closely and we are also in close contact with the authorities in London and Brussels as events unfold. We are watching matters very closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investigations into the suspect vehicle are ongoing. They involve the farmer and the truck driver, but there is not yet an outcome. We are dealing with this matter in conjunction with the Garda Síochána and I hope the investigations will be concluded this evening. We are receiving full co-operation and commitment from everybody. If people or their families are going to the UK or elsewhere, I ask them to be extremely careful because this is a virulent organism that spreads extremely quickly. If we work together on this occasion, as we did in the past when confronted with a similar danger, there is every possibility <Col N="364" /> that we can manage the situation as successfully as we did in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this short debate on two hugely important issues for Irish farmers and consumers which will directly affect our export markets. Regarding the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, I appreciate the Minister's comments, but he did not provide all the information I would have liked &ndash; perhaps this was due to time constraints. Has the source in England been identified? It is crucial in dealing with foot and mouth disease to know the origin of the outbreak. If that is known, it can be ring-fenced by the veterinary service in so far as that is possible. Given that the Minister did not mention it, I assume the source has not yet been identified.</P>
      <P>For a variety of reasons, some of them good, policing the Border is much more difficult than it was in the past. We must be concerned about the Border in so far as that is possible, but this is an all-Ireland problem, the issue is equally important for farmers in Northern Ireland and the South. The country has strengths and weaknesses in terms of health problems, but one of our great strengths in relation to foot and mouth disease is that Ireland is an island. We must react to this problem on an all-Ireland basis. Huge surveillance operations must be mounted at all our airports, large and small sea ports, fishing ports and ferry ports.</P>
      <P>I am old enough to remember the 1967 outbreak in Britain. We managed to keep it out of the country then, but it caused many problems. Every fair and mart was closed and country markets were stopped. However, better techniques are available now. I regret the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development had to leave &ndash; I appreciate he is on his way to Brussels &ndash; but I ask the Minister for Defence to convey to him that strand 2 of the Good Friday Agreement must be brought into play now. If it means anything, this is the time to implement it. The North-South Ministerial Council dealing with food safety should come into effect now &ndash; I assume Ms Bríd Rodgers is as concerned about this matter as the Minister. Both Governments and the Northern Ireland Assembly should get together and work on Ireland's behalf.</P>
      <P>Although we sincerely hope it will not happen, what contingency plans have been put in place if foot and mouth disease is found in Ireland? Ireland has enjoyed disease free status because of the absence of foot and mouth disease. It would cripple Ireland as a food exporting nation if we had to contend with foot and mouth disease in addition to BSE. This foot and mouth disease scare has come at an inopportune time for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad Members have an opportunity to address this matter before the crucial BSE meeting next Monday in Brussels. Some of the proposals would make a bad situation much worse. I wish to refer to three issues in that regard. The first is that I do not understand why T-bone steak <Col N="365" /> was banned in Ireland. I am flummoxed regarding the reason for that ban, given the control mechanisms that have been in place over the years. It sends out a terrible signal and it is not an image Ireland deserves.</P>
    <P>The Minister should put up a strong fight next Monday to have that removed as it is highly unfair to us.</P>
    <P>We made great play on it, at great cost to our tax payers, when we killed off all cohort animals in the BSE infected herds. Nobody else in Europe did that until recently. I understood that was extremely well received by the markets, the consumer organisations and, more importantly, by the veterinary council in Europe. Against that background I cannot see why we are being nailed on that issue on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I did not think I would ever hear myself say it on the floor of Leinster House, but in order to re-balance the volume of beef that will exist in two year's time we have no alternative but to bring back the calf-processing scheme. I do not like it, I am sure the Minister does not like it and there are others who do not like it, but it is better than the destruct scheme for fine quality cattle. It was implemented in some European countries in recent years, when more than one million cattle were taken out. Had they not been culled we would now face a significant problem. We must watch what the volume of beef will be like in two year's time.</P>
    <P>This proposal to mess around with the cow suckler quota is serious for Ireland. The extra 20% on the dry heifer end of the quota should not be let through on any account as we depend more on suckler cow quota than any other country per thousand head of farmers. Another thing worth mentioning is the question of the individualisation of the special beef premium. It is certainly a mechanism to ensure there will not be any expansion no matter what is done afterwards. If that succeeds God knows where it will finish.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should put the boot down next Monday. He has friends in the Council and there are other countries that have much the same problems we have. The Minister might say our head is in the lion's mouth because we depend heavily on EU financing of the destruct scheme and so on, but other countries have problems as well. A strong opposition stance must be taken on Monday on the issues about which I have spoken, many of which the Minister has identified. There are a few hugely important issues, for instance the suckler cow issue, the special beef premium and the calf processing scheme. If, at the end of the day we got a calf processing scheme on a community wide basis, everyone would share responsibility.</P>
    <P>I hope at the end of all this the perception of beef in Europe will change just as it changed in the UK. Having been the cesspool of BSE for five or six years which saw thousands of cases of the disease, the UK is the only place in Europe which has experienced an increase in beef consumption. <Col N="366" /> Whatever hope we have for our farmers it is that, if this terrible storm blows over, some of the hysterical remarks made about BSE will cease. Given another day or two, remarks made about foot and mouth disease will also be hysterical.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, I hope consumers will believe in the health controls put in place. There is no place in which to see a better example of that than in the UK. There was no place in the world where there was such a detestation of beef. The people in their millions in the UK stopped eating beef and now they have returned to eating it. I hope, when this blows over that is what will happen in France, Germany, Italy and in many other countries. We cannot accept what will be on the table in Brussels next Monday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share three minutes of my time with Dr. Upton.</P>
      <P>I am glad for the opportunity to address these two important issues. We have already spoken about the beef proposals at our committee meeting. Because of the fundamental importance of livestock to the well-being of our multi-billion pound agriculture industry, it behoves us all to unite in a response to the foot and mouth outbreak in Britain and to support all measures introduced here to ensure that the national interest is protected by the implementation of strict and rigid controls.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Connaughton that it is critical that controls are implemented on an all-Ireland basis. We only consume about 10% of our animal produce so the importance of the export markets and the protection of the agricultural industry compels us to adopt a belt and braces approach to ensure it does not reach this island. We support the measures proposed.</P>
      <P>However, there are a number of questions to be answered. The disease is a highly infectious and contagious viral disease which is spread over great distances with the movement of contaminated animals, products and objects, both animate and inanimate. If it reaches our shores it will represent a dreadful hammer-blow to our beleaguered industry. It is important that we should have contingency measures in place in relation to this disease, which spreads to all cloven-footed animals such as pigs, cattle, sheep and goats.</P>
      <P>I do not expect the Minister to reply to these questions immediately, but what is the level and frequency of contact with the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the UK? Is there a structure in place to ensure that, as information becomes available, a speedy exchange of such information is possible? Has that been the case to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to stress to everyone through the media, whether readers, viewers or listeners, the importance of people near affected areas and exclusion zones in Britain ensuring that they keep away from farms and to report it if they go to such farms. Casual visits to a farm can spread dis<Col N="367" /> ease. Were one even to stand, looking over a fence, it is possible to inhale the virus which can stay in the nose for two days. That is why it is important to report casual visits to affected areas. The virus can survive for a long time and can be spread very easily.</P>
    <P>Has there been any definitive identification of the source of the outbreak? Many farms in Britain are now being investigated in an effort to trace the source. It is critical that we discover the source. Prices in Britain are dropping by 20%-25%. It is clearly having a major impact throughout the European Union.</P>
    <P>Have there been new cases? What is the position in relation to information for retailers of food products on our shelves &ndash; those that might have imported pork products in particular over the past week or ten days? Have they been requested to withdraw or examine those in light of information becoming available? That may be addressed in the guidelines but it is an important issue. My colleague, Deputy Upton, will refer further to it.</P>
    <P>Many of the EU Commission proposals do not make any sense and both I and Deputy Brady addressed this matter in committee. Commissioner Fischler aims to try to support the beef destruction scheme until the end of the year and to stay within the Berlin limits. That is all he is doing.</P>
    <P>The proposals fail to fundamentally reform the type of farming that takes place on the Continent. The Minister is correct in that this has a disproportionate impact upon us. Intensive-feed farming on the Continent gets away scot free. EU member states should be encouraged to move toward extensification such as that which has been in Ireland, the Scottish highlands and the Welsh valleys for a number of years now. Grass reared beef is not only less likely to harbour BSE but tends to have less fat and more nutrition than that intensively farmed. It is lunacy to attack the beef farming industry at a time when we should promote it.</P>
    <P>The move to individualisation is spoken about everywhere we go, but in relation to the special beef premium it is a novel idea for male bovine animals. It is the antithesis of flexibility. If proposals were made here to take away the flexi-milk option, the Minister would have to use the personnel carrier trucks of the Army to get into Leinster House. This proposal is the equivalent of doing that to the beef farmers.</P>
    <P>I come from an area where farmers have survived for four years and were just getting off their knees when this body blow descended upon them. They are now being hit with the threat of foot and mouth disease as well. I have not ever seen as sober a reaction among the farming community as I did in recent days.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed Ireland did not vote against the ban on T-bone steaks. That was a mistake. The UK, Portugal the other countries received a derogation from this measure but Ireland, which <Col N="368" /> since 1996 had applied the most strict and rigid independent control measures for BSE, did not. If every other country had applied such measures, we would not be in the current position. Other countries denied they had even one case of BSE, thinking that this disease stopped at borders. Their people were feeding meat and bonemeal to ruminants and were not removing specified risk material. We were doing all this good work and we are penalised disproportionately. I hope the message will be made clearly to Commissioner Fischler that there is no way we will accept a disproportionate imposition upon this country. Under the former Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, we did good work in 1990. We tightened up the measures in 1996 and now we have tightened them up further. Everybody else's measures are five years behind ours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being asked to pay 30% of that cost also. The people who did nothing want to load the whole problem on us, but on this occasion, we say &ldquo;No&rdquo;. It is rare that we are unwilling to compromise but on this occasion I ask the Minister to take the matter to Commissioner Fischler and tell him that the culprits should pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer, first, to the ongoing BSE problems. I want to address the need for a serious and credible effort to eliminate BSE in Ireland. We should refer again to the purchase for destruction scheme. That scheme should be reconsidered in the light of older animals being culled. This has been mentioned a number of times and we have been given reasons it should not or cannot be done, but that should be revisited.</P>
      <P>In the long-term there is no advantage to the Irish farmer, the food industry or the consumer in behaving in a blinkered fashion about the incidence of BSE, particularly regarding its occurrence in some Border counties. I want to address this matter from the point of view of eliminating the disease, not just dealing with its effects because to date that is what we have been doing much of the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned measures regarding specified risk material, the temporary ban on meat and bonemeal and a testing programme. These measures will not ensure the elimination of BSE. The emphasis must be on the removal of the primary source, that is, the infected cattle and contaminated meat and bonemeal. I strongly urge that we forget about some of the cosmetic measures we have put in place, such as the ban on T-bone steaks, and about specified risk material. If we are to believe that meat and bonemeal was not fed to animals since 1996, animals <Col N="369" /> under four years of age should not be affected. Why then are we banning T-bone steaks from animals younger than that age? Why are we banning SRM? Does it matter? The fact that SRM audits were carried out and people were found to be in breach of the law in that regard is a different matter which relates to the effectiveness of the monitoring system, but we must look at the cosmetic effect of banning T-bone steaks and at the fundamental method for removing the primary source. I refer to the need to address hot spots in the country where BSE is occurring and to ask the relevant questions about the continuing high incidence in those areas.</P>
    <P>The outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain is potentially very damaging for Ireland. To put the matter in prospective, the cost to the Exchequer is estimated to be in the order of £8 million in the UK.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister considered the need to recall meat products from Irish retail outlets because the incubation period for foot and mouth disease is in the order of 14 days and, therefore, in a way we are playing catch-up? Products already infected could be on the shelves. I do not have the answer to that question but I would like it to be referred to the food safety authority, which might have a view on it.</P>
    <P>In the event of foot and mouth disease infecting animals in Ireland, what contingency plans are in place to cope with the containment of the disease, the destruction of animals and the disposal of carcases? I sincerely hope Ireland is not affected but if it is a case that the disease is in Northern Ireland, the transmissibility is enormously effective. It can be carried approximately 100 miles by air and, therefore, we are dealing with a potentially very serious problem of containment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rarely intervene on agriculture matters, having had the privilege of spending five years in the Department of Agriculture, but I feel obliged to join in the common position being endorsed in the House. I intervene for a variety of reasons. I want to state beyond doubt that Irish beef is safest because from the start we were the only country to take effective action when even the Commission and the other member states of the European Union were reluctant to respond. For that reason I have been very much opposed to the slaughter for destruction scheme introduced here because it conveys all the wrong signals to the consumers abroad about Irish beef as well as other beef when ours is the safest and best for the simple reason that from day one we have always imposed the strictest and most reliable controls in the interests of the consumers of Europe and of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, I welcome the fact that the Minister and the Department have, again, taken immediate and effective actions regarding the current outbreak of foot and mouth disease in England. That is what we did in 1989 when there was an outbreak of BSE in England. I want to <Col N="370" /> tell not only the House but the nation and our customers abroad that every day after that event I received a report from the chief veterinary officer in the Department on whether there was any incident in Ireland. When, as I recall well, a case was reported as suspect in July 1989, action was taken immediately. When it was confirmed about a week later, I immediately went to Government insisting that we would, first, introduce an immediate slaughter policy with full compensation for every herd affected and, second, immediately ban the use of meat and bonemeal for ruminants in line with the best scientific knowledge available then.</P>
    <P>As a third measure, we told the European Commission that we had found a case and that we wanted it to take note of the actions we were taking and to introduce a European regime. However, the Commission did not introduce a European regime &ndash; my colleagues on the Council of Ministers saw no need to do so because they saw they did not have a problem. I often wondered about that because ours was a natural grass-based industry and these other member states, which had intense feed lots and were using meat and bonemeal in 1989 and 1990, miraculously did not have a problem. Of course they have it now, but we were the ones who came out front at that stage. I appreciate, as the House will be aware, the actions were improved here in accordance with the state of scientific knowledge in 1996, but our record before Europe and the world must be relied upon now. The consumers are entitled to know that.</P>
    <P>I also remember when the cost of this was considered. At Government the then Taoiseach asked me what the measures would cost and my immediate response was, &ldquo;I do not have a clue but it will cost us a lot more if we do not do it&rdquo;, and we implemented those measures.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I agree with Deputy Penrose, Deputy Connaughton and everybody who has spoken so far that we are entitled to say that we should not be subjected to a purchase for destruction scheme and we should not have considered that scheme. It is not appropriate for us. It gives the wrong signal to the markets. It was wrong of us to agree to the ban on T-bone steaks. That is nonsense. If others are obliged to do it, that is fair enough because it is about time they took the action which we took.</P>
    <P>As you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, will be aware, foot and mouth disease had a major impact on my county in 1941 to the extent, although I do not want to be frivolous, that it cost us an all-Ireland championship, but all of us did what was required of us then.</P>
    <P>There will be a gathering of my parliamentary colleagues and some Members of this House in Killarney over the weekend and I have instructed the secretariat to make all my colleagues coming from Britain aware of the significance of this for us. I am sure they will all behave responsibly anyway but I have instructed that they make sure before they arrive at our shores that they report <Col N="371" /> to the desk of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in case there is even the remotest risk that any one of them, who are coming here for a common purpose with us, have been in contact with foot and mouth disease. This is an opportunity to demonstrate to world markets that we have always had the best and safest product and we should not compromise that image under any circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great sadness that we discuss the alarming situation in the agriculture sector. I wish to comment on the foot and mouth disease outbreak. Agri-industry exports are worth about £15 million per day, a matter which cannot and must not be ignored. It must not be ignored either by the Government that the situation along the Border is different today than it was during the previous outbreak of foot and mouth disease when Customs posts, among other forms of security, were in place. It is vital that a solution is found to the problem in a positive fashion.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste was asked on the Order of Business if direct meetings or discussions had been held with the Northern Ireland Minister, Bríd Rodgers, to ensure everything was done to keep the whole island clear of foot and mouth disease. It is much easier to man ports than patrol the Border, important though that may be. There are cross-Border industries which did not exist on the occasion of the previous outbreak. The co-operative industry and others have a major involvement on both sides of the Border. The crisis in milk production and other areas is serious. The facilities established under the Good Friday Agreement must be utilised to ensure contacts are made to deal with the problem on an all island basis.</P>
      <P>There is a need to ensure imports from third countries, including meat, are curtailed. I have raised the issue of poultry imports on previous occasions. It is not certain that they are subject to the same veterinary restrictions as in Ireland or elsewhere in Europe.</P>
      <P>The cuts suggested by the European Commission to deal with BSE will cost the Irish agri-industry about £200 million per year. Ireland is being asked to bear more than its fair share. The Commission which talks about extensification must recognise that our production is grass-based. The Minister must fight hard. It will be more difficult than before because we have lost much support due to the actions of the Minister for Finance. I hope we can regain it because we will need friends in the European Union in dealing with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suckler farmers should have the opportunity to opt for in-calf heifers rather than dry heifers because there will be a need for quality beef when this problem is resolved. The European Commission is investing 1 million per year in maize production. We must compete with intensive bull beef production in Europe, the feed for which is subsidised. Yet, we are being asked to cut back. It is unacceptable that this production <Col N="372" /> is maintained in Europe at our expense. German beef is being dumped here.</P>
    <P>The calf processing scheme has been mentioned. Although a dairy farmer, I hate that scheme. I like to watch calves being born, reared and jumping around the fields. It is more realistic, however, to have that type of scheme than to remove finished cattle of the best quality. The Minister must fight hard to ensure such a scheme is introduced in the long-term.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that steers be removed is another direct blow to Irish agricultural structures. As the consumer is extremely important, there is a need to ensure live and other beef exports to third countries are resumed. The best we can do is to ensure everything we have done to make our product special and perfect is used in promotion and sales.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>As a farmer, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Unfortunately, the Minister has had to leave the House, but he has a good replacement in the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, who has a good knowledge of agriculture.</P>
      <P>I commend the Government on its support for the agriculture industry during these difficult years. It has provided substantial necessary support for farming because of unforeseen difficulties which have beset the industry in recent years. Unfortunately, they continue to increase. We are fortunate in that foot and mouth disease has not affected herds in Ireland for the past 60 years.</P>
      <P>The work of the farming community is at the root of Ireland's economic success. A vibrant farming sector is vital to overall national development. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is acutely aware of the importance of the meat industry to the national economy. More importantly, his Cabinet colleagues actively support him. The incomes of those working in farming must be protected in order that this major national industry can continue its important contribution to the national economy.</P>
      <P>The European Commission proposals regarding suckler cows and beef premia would be a disaster for Ireland. The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine gave the Minister its full support for whatever action is necessary at the Agriculture Council meeting next Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish beef is the safest in the world. Many refer to the purchase for destruction scheme as a disease remedy. It was introduced to place a floor on the price of beef. If that had not been done, we all know what price we would receive for beef today. I would support a calf destruction scheme, especially for non-beef breeds, which is where we should begin. I do not like to see good beef stock being destroyed, but there is no other option. The Commission intends to replace the purchase for destruction scheme with a special purchase scheme which will run until the end of the year. That is welcome. The main difference between the schemes is that member states will have the <Col N="373" /> option of storing beef for intervention or distribution as food aid or free food to poorer sections of the community. That is welcome and should be implemented. I support the scheme.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government on taking appropriate action to protect the national herd and, thereby, farming enterprises. Foot and mouth is an infectious disease which would have disastrous consequences for agricultural production were it to reach Ireland. Precautionary steps are vital. A full commitment is necessary from all concerned to ensure continued disease-free status. Departmental staff in district veterinary offices and ports, airports and meat factories will, with assistance from the Garda Síochána, police the ban on products from Britain and Northern Ireland. Farmers must also take their own precautions. They must be careful as to who they admit to their property. Disinfection measures must be adhered to in all places where farming and related pursuits are carried on. All these precautions will only be effective if everybody concerned is determined that Ireland must remain disease free.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The threat of foot and mouth disease has now eclipsed the BSE problem which the House discussed earlier. I regret the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development had to leave the House at short notice and that neither of the Ministers of State at that Department are here for this debate. However, I do not underestimate the capability of the Minister for Defence to communicate our concerns to his Government colleagues.</P>
      <P>Compensation for farmers who sold off cattle prior to the slaughter scheme should be a priority for the Minister in discussions in Brussels. Direct aid compensation for the BSE slump should also be pursued actively. Newspaper reports today indicate that French farmers expect such direct aid when their Minister defends their case in Brussels next Monday. Despite the warning from the EU Commission that cattle numbers must be reduced across Europe to offset the cost of the BSE crisis on the CAP budget, French cattle farmers now have the reassurance from their Minister for Agriculture of national Government backing. Irish farmers have not yet got such an assurance from our Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, but I hope he also will pursue national measures if an adequate package is not secured at Brussels level.</P>
      <P>The efforts of the EU Commission to apply a permanent cut-back in meat production are very disturbing. I call on our Minister to leave aside any kid glove approach and to veto any attempt at EU level to reduce Ireland's suckler cow herd. He should also seek a derogation from the unfair ban on our excellent T-bone steak, which compares with that of any other country. The Irish member of the EU Commission should have resisted that proposal. I hope the Minister, Deputy Walsh, will be successful on this issue next Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> A negative response from Brussels would have disastrous consequences for the Irish beef industry. We have the outstanding feature that over 50% of our product comes from beef suckler herds, compared to only 20% in many other EU member states. I urge the Minister to seek support from Brussels to establish a floor price of £350 per cow, to encourage the disposal of dry cows through the slaughter scheme. The relatively disease-free status of our cattle herd provides a vital argument which the Minister should use in the forthcoming negotiations in Brussels.</P>
    <P>There are three main players in the meat industry, namely, cattle producers, meat processing factories and workers. Although a safety net has been provided for the producers and the processors, there is no compensation scheme for the workers, many of whom have been laid off by the meat factories. The Minister should also fight the workers' case in Brussels because they are a key element of our meat industry. He should seek a comprehensive aid package which will benefit farmers, processors and workers.</P>
    <P>The British people are renowned for their traditional roast beef and yorkshire pudding. They rightly support their own farm produce. That same spirit of loyalty to the home product should also prevail in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter in the House. The announcement last Thursday that Celtic Circuits Limited, Listowel, will close down on 2 March came as a major disappointment to the 33 staff members at the plant. The closure also represents a significant setback for job creation in Listowel and its hinterland, which has been hard hit by job losses over the past five years. The town lost 105 jobs when Neo Data closed in 1997, 55 jobs in Radlink in 1999 and 75 jobs in Munster Electronics in 1997. A local food company, Caterbake, also closed in 1999 with the loss of ten jobs. The combined loss of 250 jobs over the past four years in a town of this size is equivalent to a loss of at least 100,000 jobs in Dublin. One can imagine the outcry which job losses on that scale would cause in the capital city.</P>
      <P>Celtic Circuits, which was established in early 1998, manufactured printed circuit boards in the medium-sized high-tech speciality area. Despite large investments in plant and machinery, the company got into difficulties, largely due to lack of sales and slowness in building up its market. Other contributory factors included the slow-down in the US economy and strong competition from products imported from Asian and east European sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the diligence and hard work of the company's managing director, Mr. Kevin Neville, and his staff over the past three years. The com<Col N="375" /> pany developed from producing single layer printed circuit boards to manufacturing quality-assured, high-tech, multi-layered and gold-plated products. The commitment and dedication of the employees was exemplary at all times. The employees are willing to co-operate in every possible way with any future purchaser of Celtic Circuits. They are prepared to be reasonable and receptive to any proposals to secure the survival of the company.</P>
    <P>In view of the job losses in Listowel over the past few years and the fact that the local community has raised more than £1 million under a BES scheme to construct a state-of-the-art advance factory in an effort to attract industry to the town, I ask the Minister to see that a special effort is made by his Department, the IDA and Shannon Development to secure an industry for Listowel.</P>
    <P>This town now has four empty industrial sites. I doubt if there is any other Irish town, outside the major urban centres, with this amount of unoccupied industrial space available. This level of job losses is unacceptable. I ask the Minister to back the genuine efforts of the local community and labour force to promote industrial development in Listowel by directing the IDA and SFADCo to give top priority to finding a replacement industry as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the loss of 33 jobs in Celtic Circuits. This loss is a major disappointment to the people of Listowel and its immediate area. The company was established in 1998 to manufacture printed circuit boards. Its initial development was based on the annual demand for such products from two specific companies. The intention was then to build on this business. Celtic was an Irish owned operation and an investment of over £2 million had been put into the company by way of plant and machinery. The company has suffered significant losses since last year and this has led to unsustainable accumulated losses over the years. The company has been trading at a loss and this could not continue, and responsibility to ensure it did not continue rested with the company directors. A further investment of approximately £500,000 was needed for the company to keep trading. Current problems stemmed from competition in the Far East as the price of printed circuit boards has fallen worldwide. This competition has made it extremely difficult for Celtic to secure business locally. A typical example is that the company recently bid for particular business in competition with a supplier from the Far East and the winning price from the Far East supplier was equivalent to Celtic's material costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite large investments in plant and machinery, lack of sales and slowness in building up the market are largely responsible for the company's difficulties. Furthermore, the situation has not <Col N="376" /> been helped by the slow-down in the American economy and by heavy competition from printed circuit boards imported from the Far East and eastern Europe, as I have already outlined. Unfortunately, the directors of the company had no further options open to them and last Friday, 16 February, they informed the company's employees at a meeting that the company would cease to trade and would go into liquidation.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the company has called a meeting of its creditors and this is scheduled to take place on 1 March. I understand that the company will cease trading at that time. The workforce has been kept informed of developments. Over the coming days, parties who might have an interest in a printed circuit board facility will be contacted and informed of the situation. I hope something will emerge from this consultation process.</P>
    <P>I will ensure that the State development agencies, IDA, Shannon Development, Enterprise Ireland, the Kerry Enterprise Board and FÁS, will all work closely together and with other interested parties to find a replacement industry for Listowel and also to promote the development of existing industry in the area. The full supports from FÁS will also be available to the workers. These include briefing the workers on their options, individual interviews with the workers to understand their specific needs and making available a short training programme to include job seeking skills and confidence building measures.</P>
    <P>I am confident that a focused development agency approach, integrated with a local based approach, both of which address the employment situation, will make it possible to find a replacement industry for the jobs that have been lost. Shannon Development has been particularly concerned with and interested in improving the employment situation in Listowel.</P>
    <P>In addition to Shannon Development's efforts there has been a strong focus by IDA Ireland over recent years on achieving better progress in job creation and economic development in north Kerry. Five new projects were announced in north Kerry over the past three years, four in Tralee and one in Castleisland. These projects will create over 700 jobs for the area. I share Deputy Deenihan's concern and appreciate that there is a large surplus of available workspace in the area, as he pointed out. My Department and the State agencies are giving this matter the highest priority. We are optimistic that through negotiations over coming weeks and months we will find a replacement industry as quickly as possible to ensure that the skilled workforce in the area is not lost.</P>

      <P>I realise that and will move on to the funding of schools but it was necessary to put on the record the fact that the Minister was found to have broken the law.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue because there is basic discrimination in the allocation of funds by the State for secondary and other second level schools. When I refer to secondary schools I refer to voluntary secondary schools run by lay people, priests, nuns, religious brothers and non-Catholic schools. They are the poor relations of the education system though it is not as if they form a minor part of the education system. There are 420 such schools and they provide education for 64% of our second level students, more than 200,000 pupils.</P>
      <P>The Blackstock study was commissioned by former Deputy Niamh Bhreathnach when she was Minister for Education and a report was published in June 1999 entitled Funding for Second Level Schools. A technical group had examined the voluntary sector and the comprehensive-community schools sector. It found there was blatant discrimination against the voluntary sector and recommended in its report that the State pay grants equitably to all second level schools. The report stated that the State covers the bulk of insurance costs in comprehensive and community schools and, accordingly, as all schools are to be treated equally, the funding formula would have to be adjusted appropriately.</P>
      <P>The voluntary sector demands no more or less than equitable treatment. It is looking for the payment of grants on an equitable basis for caretakers and secretaries. A school with 500 pupils in the voluntary sector receives 0.66 of the cost of a caretaker, while a comprehensive or community school gets funding for two caretakers. A voluntary school gets 0.8 of the cost of a secretary, while a comprehensive or community school is funded for the wages of one and a half secretaries. There are no cleaning grants for the voluntary sector while a comprehensive or community school with 500 pupils is given £16,320 towards cleaning. There is no allocation under the minor work programme for the voluntary sector and such schools must beg for every penny. St. Joseph's in Rush, which is in my constituency, eventually gave up trying to get the Department to pay to resurface its play area and had to engage in endless fundraising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Life for the parents of the 200,000 pupils in the voluntary sector is an endless round of coffee mornings and race nights for fundraising, with the attendant insurance costs and so on. I ask the Minister of State to make sure the Blackstock report, as published by her Department, is <Col N="378" /> implemented in full. Why has the Government not faced up to this unconstitutional behaviour? We are meant to treat all the children of the State equally.</P>
    <P>At present one voluntary sector school has been challenged by the trade union representing its caretaker. The union is threatening to bring the school to the rights commissioner if the caretaker is not paid what caretakers in comprehensive and community schools get. The latter schools get a full grant for a caretaker while a voluntary school must raise funds for its caretaker. A school in Cork has seen its insurance costs rise from £5,000 to £9,000 in one year. I will not put up with the blatant discrimination against voluntary schools such as the four in my constituency, the Loretto schools, St. Joseph's and the Christian Brothers school. It is time the Department faced up to the recommendations in its own report and paid proper grants to these schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend only to deal with the matter legitimately raised on the Adjournment by Deputy Owen and I thank her for raising it.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the demand by voluntary secondary schools for increased funding, including for the many reasons outlined by Deputy Owen. The funding arrangements for the different school types at second level have evolved in a manner that reflects the different traditions and structures of the voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community and VEC sectors. This evolution has, by its very nature, generated funding anomalies and structures that lack uniformity and cohesion.</P>
      <P>At the core of funding arrangements at second level is reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding. In the case of voluntary secondary schools in the free education scheme, which are privately managed institutions, the Department meets the cost of teacher salaries, excluding the first £400, and allowances and makes an annual <i>per capita</i> grant towards the recurrent cost of schools. In addition, these schools may also be eligible for assistance under a range of other grants available under the scheme, including grants for the employment of secretaries and caretakers and curricular support. Regarding insurance cover on school property and against public liability, this is a matter for the managerial authorities of the individual schools to arrange. Grant aid towards voluntary secondary school funding costs provided by my Department by way of <i>per capita</i> grants may be used for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant, which also covers the VEC overheads and other activities apart from the <Col N="379" /> second level programme. The Department does not earmark allocations for individual schools or for the various activities of vocational education committees. Secretarial, caretaking and other maintenance staffing support is also allocated to vocational education committees on a scheme basis. The deployment of such staff is a matter for vocational education committees. In the case of vocational schools and colleges, insurance cover is arranged by the relevant vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>The annual budgets for community and comprehensive colleges take into account factors that vary from school to school. All schools in this sector have been provided with secretarial and maintenance support services. Regarding insurance cover, the State provides a general indemnity to the authorities of these schools in lieu of their taking out insurance cover against liabilities that may arise. Budgets for vocational education committees and community and comprehensive schools are increased on a <i>pro rata</i> basis with increases in the <i>per capita</i> grant.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I consider that the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements, including the matter of equity of funding between the different sectors at second level. While further work is required to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools, the priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding.</P>
      <P>In this connection the Department has shown its commitment by the establishment of the school services support fund, which is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. This funding initiative represents a new approach by the Department that supports the school development planning process. This process can only be enhanced if each school is given flexibility in the deployment of its resources. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking services, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interest of their pupils and for the operation of their schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £4 million to voluntary secondary schools each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, since 1997, notwithstanding many competing demands on budgetary resources, the funding allocated to secondary schools has been increased substantially. The standard <i>per capita</i> grant was increased to £184 from £177 in 1999. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged <Col N="380" /> schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>Secondary schools have also benefited from increases in the grant scheme for school books for needy pupils, the national reading initiative, the library grant, the IT 2000 initiative, the science initiative and the increase in the grant for secretarial services.</P>
    <P>While funding arrangements have evolved in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and reflect the different traditions and structures of the various types of schools, the Department's approach to date has clearly shown commitment and determination to improve funding at second level. We intend to build further on progress made to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>St. Canice's boys' school in Finglas is in urgent need of complete refurbishment. I visited the school recently and was shocked by what I found. The exterior of the building is seriously run-down, with rotting windows and an overall appearance of dereliction. The conditions inside the school are reminiscent of the poor conditions which obtained in the 1930s. In 2001, these conditions are shameful. Teachers and pupils are working in their overcoats because of the cold. For six weeks during the winter, temperatures at the school fell below the required standard of 16 degrees centigrade. This was in spite of the fact that the heating was set at full power, at huge expense to the board of management.</P>
      <P>Most of the windows in the school are nailed closed, some cannot be fully closed and all need to be replaced as a matter of urgency. The central heating system has many leaks and must be completely replaced. The roof of the school is in very poor condition and requires total refurbishment. Large lumps of plaster have fallen from ceilings, both in classrooms and on corridors, exposing the beams above. Several of the toilets are beyond use and leaking. This has resulted in seepage into the plasterwork of the walls on the main corridor, giving a permanently strong stench of urine in many parts of the school.</P>
      <P>The administration section of the school is dilapidated and hopelessly inadequate. There is no parents' room and, therefore, the work of the home-school-community liaison teacher is greatly hampered. Cleaning materials and equipment are kept in the staff toilets because the small storeroom is used to house the photocopier and computer. The school secretary operates from a tiny cubby-hole off the main corridor and the principal's office is completely inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The required repair work has been promised for a long time but, as yet, no formal approvals have been given. Following an inspection last summer, it was decided to urgently remove asbestos from the floor tiles and window sills. Since then the concrete walls and floors have been left bare which has made it even more difficult to heat the premises. Teachers now stand on small <Col N="381" /> mats and have to ensure that the pupils stand up and move around frequently to remain warm.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing is that, in spite of the appalling physical conditions, the school is retaining its pupil numbers. This is a huge credit to the quality of teaching provided by the staff. I have no doubt that no other group of public sector workers would tolerate these dreadful working conditions. The staff would be perfectly justified in withdrawing from work because of those conditions. The parents, who are exceptionally loyal to the school, are rapidly losing patience with the Department and the Minister who have shown such scant regard for the needs of their children.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Government has access to such a large budget surplus, it is morally reprehensible that children should be obliged to suffer the effects of official neglect of this nature. St. Canice's boys' school in Finglas needs urgent and full refurbishment to bring it up to modern standards and to ensure that its pupils and staff have access to the facilities they deserve. This school retains special disadvantaged status, but the disgraceful conditions which obtain there compound the disadvantage and do nothing to encourage a positive attitude among the pupils to their school. I call on the Minister to give immediate approval to the required refurbishment work and to sanction the immediate provision of temporary prefabricated accommodation while that work is being carried out. The pupils and staff at St. Canice's deserve nothing less. They have been neglected for long enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising the issue of St. Canice's boys' national school in Finglas. As she stated, the school has a substantial staffing level of a principal, 16 mainstream class teachers, two remedial teachers, one resource teacher and one home-school liaison teacher.</P>
      <P>The management authorities of the school submitted an application to the Department for grant assistance towards major refurbishment works. Following an assessment of the situation, the Department subsequently approved an extension consisting of special tuition rooms, a library, office space, a home-school liaison room, a staff room and storage areas, in addition to the refurbishment works. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that the scope of the works to be carried out at this school have increased significantly since the initial application was received. The design team appointed for the project has submitted detailed documentation and plans for the proposed works and these are under consideration in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This project is one of a large number currently being processed by the Department of Education and Science. In regard to the primary sector alone, there are over 300 major projects in architectural planning. Major projects in this context are those of an estimated value of £250,000 or more. In addition, there are approximately 400 applications being processed which have not gone to architectural planning. Due to the large number of applications for grant aid in respect of capital works, delays in the processing of individual projects are inevitable. However, I assure the <Col N="382" /> Deputy that in this particular case every effort is being made to progress the project. I remind the Deputy that hugely significant progress has been made by the Government in the past three years in eliminating substandard schools from the education system.</P>
    <P>Since taking office the Government has invested massively in capital projects for the primary sector. In 2000, £81 million was allocated for primary school capital projects. This has been increased to £93 million for the current school year. This compares with £19.5 million in 1993 and £34 million in 1997. Under the national development plan, 2000-06, an unprecedented £413 million has been set aside for school infrastructure.</P>
    <P>In addition to these measures, the level of grant aid under the capital devolved grants scheme for the primary sector was recently increased. In 2000, £14 million was allocated to this scheme. A similar amount will be allocated for the current school year. This scheme empowers boards of management to address health and safety issues at local level.</P>
    <P>From the outset the Government has made education a top priority. While we acknowledge that much remains to be done, we remain committed to education as a top priority and will continue to build on progress and ensure St. Canice's school is kept at the top of the review list when the applications are being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy McGrath. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic which is important to both of us.</P>
      <P>This is an important issue for the people of Longford and Westmeath. Deputy McGrath and I have raised it on numerous occasions. Deputy McGrath has raised it at health board level also.</P>
      <P>A commitment was given many years ago that the hospital in Mullingar would be upgraded to a major infrastructure and state-of-the-art hospital to accommodate the population of Longford and Westmeath. When phases 1 and 2A were completed, everybody anticipated that phase 2B would be equipped and staffed. While I accept that there were changes in respect of the infrastructure, it should not have taken two years to implement minor architectural changes. The people are seething with anger. They are of the view that they are being left behind, that there is foot-dragging and passing of the buck. It was the health board's responsibility. The matter is now with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>I want simple answers. Has the review of the brief been completed? Has all the information been submitted by the health board? I understand it has. When will the design team be appointed? Can the architectural team be appointed contemporaneously with the appointment of the design team? That is the only way this project will be expedited. Otherwise, there will be more foot-dragging. The people are rightly angry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eight or nine months ago we thought the Minister for Health and Children was bringing good news, but <Col N="383" /> he was engaged only in a public relations exercise. We thought the design team would be in place, that the architectural team would have been appointed and that various other steps would have been taken. As Deputy McGrath mentioned when raising other issues in public, three accident and emergency consultants, on a temporary basis for 12 months, were appointed to Tullamore. I call upon the Minister to stop foot-dragging and let the people of Longford and Westmeath know exactly what is happening. There is a need for phase 2B to be fitted out and completed without further delay or procrastination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing time with me.</P>
      <P>Phase 2A of Mullingar General Hospital which provided for a new accident and emergency unit, an X-ray unit, out-patients department and so on was completed in July 1997. Full commissioning was completed in September 1998. This phase included a five-storey block which was to have been fitted out at a later date to provide much needed extra beds for this busy hospital. Unfortunately, we have a white elephant, a five-storey block standing empty.</P>
      <P>The Department has been dragging its feet on this issue for a long time. Reluctantly, to quell the anger of those encountered by Fianna Fáil candidates in the run-up to the local elections in 1999, the Minister appointed a project team to take the development of the hospital to the next stage. The team was approved in May 1998 and presented its recommendations to the Department in February 2000. The project was publicly launched in May 2000. Deputy Penrose and I attended the launch. The project team recommended a range of new and extended facilities for Mullingar Hospital, including a rehabilitation unit, a large obstetrics unit, additional ICU and CCU facilities and a range of other ancillary services. These facilities will extend Mullingar Hospital from its present complement of 197 beds to a much larger hospital with 283 beds.</P>
      <P>At the launch of the project, the expected timescale was outlined for the development. Approval of the brief was to be completed in June 2000. This was expected to be done quickly because there were four officials of the Department of Health and Children on the project team. The appointment of a design team was to be completed by December 2000. Development of plans and final design were to be completed by December 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schedule is almost one year behind because of the Minister's delay in not delivering to County Westmeath. He seems to be actively working against developments in Mullingar by appointing three accident and emergency consultants to Tullamore, ignoring the busiest accident and emergency unit in the midlands and giving £500,000 to expand and enhance breast cancer services in Portlaoise, contrary to decisions taken by the Midland Health Board to develop Portlaoise and Mullingar in parallel. The Minister has <Col N="384" /> overruled the decision of the health board. He is ignoring the health needs of the people of Westmeath and Longford and presiding over the downgrading of Mullingar Hospital. The people will not tolerate it and will shortly be on the streets protesting. I ask the Minister of State to bring a strong message back to the Department. The Minister must deliver in Westmeath and get on with the job quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies McGrath and Penrose for raising this matter. The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, approved the establishment of a project team in May 1999 to commence the planning of the phase 2B development at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital. In keeping with normal practice, the project team was asked to prepare a written design brief for the development of phase 2B taking into account the considerable detail involved in developing a brief of this kind. The original brief for the hospital development indicated that phase 2B would include the following departments: pathology, theatres, general medicine, general surgery, administration services, isolation facilities, staff changing and rest rooms. The urgent requirement for an acute psychiatric unit on the site was highlighted subsequent to the development of the brief.</P>
      <P>The brief, dated 10 November 2000, was received in the Department of Health and Children on 16 November 2000 and officials in the Department were given the task of processing the brief to facilitate bringing it to the next stage. In a letter, dated 10 November, from the chief executive officer of the Midland Health Board, which accompanied the brief, he expressed the view of the project team that in the event of additional national development plan funding or other capital funding being made available, the outstanding departments not now included in phase 2B, namely, rehabilitation unit, child and adolescent psychiatry, occupational therapy, catering department, day services, other than surgical, should proceed as part of the phase 2B contract. A further letter, dated 10 January 2001, from the secretary to the Midland Health Board to the Secretary General at the Department indicated:</P>
      <P>At its December 2000 meeting of the Board, members unanimously adopted a motion calling on the Minister for Health and Children to give a firm commitment on the inclusion of the I.C.U., C.C.U., Rehabilitation Unit, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Occupational Therapy Department, Catering Department and Day Services in Phase 2B of the Longford/Westmeath Development.</P>
      <P>The additional accommodation is a substantial additional cost of the phase 2B proposal for which the project team was appointed. The Department will consider these additional proposals in the light of the availability of funding under the national development plan, 2000-06.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 27 February 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 17, 21 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy for road safety 1998-2002, the first ever national road safety strategy to be adopted by the Government, has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the Strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety, whose first progress report published in July 1999 and second progress report published in August 2000, detail <Col N="386" /> progress with key actions. Copies of both reports have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>The second progress report shows that real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the Government strategy. Road deaths decreased by 59, or nearly 13% between 1997 and 1999 relative to the strategy target of a 20% minimum reduction by 2002. Serious injuries decreased in the same period by over 15% relative to a similar reduction target of 20% by end 2002. The interim targets fixed by the strategy for achievement by 2000 have been well met.</P>
    <P>Progress is also ahead of target in extending low cost accident measures across the national road network, with 268 schemes completed by end 2000 and a further 88 approved. On the other hand, recent NRA surveys have shown that considerable improvement will be needed in order to achieve road safety targets for reducing speeding and increasing seat belt wearing. There was also a small increase in the number of road deaths in 2000 over 1999.</P>
    <P>Garda enforcement activity has been intensified and improved in accordance with the road safety strategy. More than 224,000 on the spot fines issued in relation to speeding offences in 2000, compared to 175,000 in 1999 and 130,000 in 1998. Fixed speed cameras are in operation on four of the main national routes out of Dublin and on the M50. Speed limit enforcement is also being supported by an increase in mobile speed detection, the use of laser speed detection as well as in-car and motorcycle cameras. At the end of 2000, approximately 84,000 on the spot fines had been issued for non-wearing of seat belts since the introduction of this measure in July 1999. The number of detections for drink driving in 1999 increased by 18% over 1998. Evidential breath testing is being progressively introduced in relation to drink driving enforcement.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy envisages a penalty points system in support of road safety enforcement. The Government approved the drafting of legislation necessary for this measure in July 2000. The design of the system has, as anticipated in the strategy, required careful consideration because of the exclusive constitutional role of the Irish courts in the administration of justice. The drafting of the Bill is now being finalised and I expect it to be published very soon. My Department is also working to ensure the availability of a national driver file, complete with penalty points functionality, within the present year.</P>
    <P>Statistics relating to road accidents are published by the NRA in their annual road accident facts reports. The most recent report is for 1999 and that report, along with reports relating to previous years, are available in the Oireachtas Library. There were 413 road deaths in 1999 and 1,867 serious injuries. The report for 2000 is not yet available but Garda figures indicate that there were 415 road deaths in 2000 and 58 deaths to 19 February this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> Ensuring compliance with the targets of the road safety strategy will command the full effort and support of the Government and its agencies. By reference to the estimates set out in the strategy in 1998, over 100 lives are now being saved each year as a result of implementing the strategy compared to a continuation of trends prior to 1998.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Overall Government policy on waste management is committed to a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach which will deliver ambitious recovery and recycling targets over a 15 year period. These include diversion of 50% of overall household waste away from landfill, a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable waste consigned to landfill, the development of composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum, and recycling of 35% of municipal waste.</P>
      <P>Having regard to these targets, current and proposed local and regional waste management plans incorporate proposals for household segregation and separate collection of organic waste and dry recyclables in urban areas, an extended network of bring facilities in rural areas, typically with a target density of one facility per 500 population, an increased network of civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations, a range of centralised composting and other biological treatment facilities, and support for home composting of food and garden waste, especially in rural areas.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that local authorities complete the current strategic planning process and proceed with the delivery of the improved waste services and infrastructure that are proposed. The National Development Plan 2000-2006 anticipates capital investment of at least £650 million in the development of waste management infrastructure. Of this, some £100 million in Exchequer or EU funding will be provided to support the development of requisite waste recycling and recovery infrastructure over the life of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A segregated household collection scheme for dry recyclables is currently being provided to some 70,000 households in the Dublin region and will progressively be extended with a view, ultimately, to providing segregated collection services for dry and organic wastes in respect of 80% of households in the region. The proposed regional waste plans provide for this kind of service in all large urban areas around the country, and I expect that local authorities in other regions will move rapidly to provide, or require the pro<Col N="388" /> vision of, equivalent segregated collection and recovery services within their functional areas. I understand that Repak Limited, which was established to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste, is prepared to make funding available to assist local authorities in the initiation and development of such services.</P>
    <P>In addition, various producer responsibility initiatives are under way or being developed. Repak Ltd. recently initiated a new scheme to incentivise the collection and recycling of additional amounts of packaging waste by waste contractors throughout the country. Further industry-led initiatives are being pursued at this time in relation to construction and demolition waste, end of life vehicles, tyres and electrical and electronic waste.</P>
    <P>A policy statement on waste prevention and recovery will shortly be published. This will address in detail the factors and practical considerations which are relevant to the achievement of policy objectives and targets in this area, and will outline the scope of measures which will be undertaken in support of a better national recycling performance. These measures will encompass proposals in relation to waste prevention and minimisation, market development for recyclables, and the provision of further reprocessing capacity for recyclable materials.</P>

      <P>When engaging private consultants, it is a matter for planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to put in place the necessary procedures to avoid conflicts of interests. Planning applications are processed by planning authorities in accordance with the provisions of the planning Acts and regulations. Under the planning Acts, planning control is an executive function of the planning authority vested in the manager. While this function can be delegated to senior officials of the authority in accordance with local government legislation, the actual making of a decision on a planning application cannot be delegated to a person who is not an official of the authority. The main use by local authorities of planning consultants has been for the preparation of development plans, local area action plans, integrated area plans etc.</P>
      <P>With regard to An Bord Pleanála, section 11(5) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, provides that the board shall, subject to compliance with planning legislation, regulate its own procedure and business. Any decision to engage private planning consultants to assist in the discharge of its functions is a matter for the board. The current statutory provisions regarding declarations of interest, etc. apply to private consultants as well as to the board's own staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has often written to planning authorities asking them to consider their staffing levels so that the planning system <Col N="391" /> does not cause bottlenecks in meeting demand, and delivers the best possible service. My Department approved requests from planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála to sanction additional professional planner posts. Some authorities have difficulties in filling additional posts.</P>
      <P>The most recent survey by my Department of the larger local authority planning departments &ndash; county councils and county borough corporations &ndash; carried out on 31 January 2001, found that the overall number of serving staff, both administrative and professional, had increased to 1,090. This compares to a figure of 1,066 in October 2000, 994 in July 2000 and 895 in September 1999. In relation to professional planners, the January survey found that there were 394 authorised posts for professional planners, 66 of which were vacant at that time, i.e. the total number of serving professional planners was 328. This compares positively with the results of the October survey which reported 301 serving professional planners.</P>
      <P>In July 2000, I approved an increase of 29 additional staff &ndash; nine professional planners and 20 administrative staff &ndash; which brought An Bord Pleanála's authorised staff complement to 134, excluding board members. Recruitment of these additional staff is ongoing.</P>
      <P>In June 2000, I made the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 2000, which increased the size of exempted domestic extensions from 23 square metres to 40 square metres. This was designed to remove about 30% of planning applications for such extensions from the planning system in major urban areas, to allow planners to concentrate on more complex applications and forward planning issues.</P>
      <P>I contacted my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and the third level education sector to identify ways of producing more planners through the education system. From September 2000 new and expanded courses in University College Dublin and Dublin Institute of Technology Bolton Street will treble the output of graduate planners in two years time to approximately 75 planners graduating per annum. In the interim, to meet the short-term demand, the employment of planners from abroad on fixed term contracts is being pursued. In this regard, my Department and local authorities are participating in the FÁS Jobs Ireland Campaign.</P>

      <P>My Department <Col N="392" /> circulated the draft general scheme of a building control Bill to other Departments for comment before Christmas. The general scheme is being revised in the light of the comments received.</P>
      <P>The proposed legislation strengthens the enforcement powers of local building control authorities and the registration of the titles of architect, building surveyor and quantity surveyor. In accordance with standard practice, I cannot disclose details of the proposed legislation until it has been approved by the Government and is drafted and published.</P>
      <P>I can inform the House that the proposed legislation will not provide for the registration of builders or contractors. There are two reasons for this. First, the forum for the construction industry is unwilling to amend their draft proposals for the registration of contractors to make the registration system independent of contractors. Second, the forum proposes that all public works contracts only be awarded to registered contractors. Such a restriction could be anti-competitive, inhibiting entry of non-resident contractors into the market. This would be contrary to the Government strategy of encouraging overseas contractors to augment domestic construction capacity by participating in the delivery of construction projects worth £22 billion, contained in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 26, 42 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has agreed to the introduction by the Revenue Commissioners of a levy on all plastic shopping bags used here. This measure requires primary legislation, and an appropriate provision will be included in the forthcoming Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2001, to be published shortly. I intend to implement the levy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The supply side measure referred to will be complemented by a mandatory point of sale charge by retailers, to ensure that the impact of the levy is fully passed on to consumers. The measures aims to directly influence consumer behaviour and achieve a reduction in the consumption of plastic shopping bags dispensed at retail outlets. These are a highly visible component of litter. Retailers must decide to what extent they will provide customers with alternatives to plastic shopping bags. Customers can use re-useable bags or other containers for shopping purposes, and avoid the levy. Utilising reusable shopping bags is part of an initiative on environmentally friendly shopping under the national environmental awareness campaign. I make a distinction between plastic shopping bags, and plastic bags used as primary packaging for products such as fertiliser. I have no proposals at this time to levy such primary packaging.</P>

      <P>Proposals relating to pedestrian friendly fronts on vehicles are being considered at present by the European Commission. While the car manufacturing industry has made considerable progress in this area, it is understood to favour a voluntary agreement rather than a directive for the implementation of related standards. Discussions on the matter are continuing between the Commission and the car industry.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitment in the Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, Ireland will support strongly the introduction of new vehicle safety measures at EU level and will move to implement them without delay. Vehicle related safety measures can help to avoid accidents and to mitigate their consequences. However, their full benefit can only be realised in an overall framework of responsible behaviour by road users individually and collectively.</P>

      <P>Latest published figures from my Department's house price statistics indicate that, on a national basis, the average price of a new house in the September quarter 2000 was £133,459. The average new house price for the June quarter 1997 was £78,415.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming to office, the Government has taken a wide range of measures to increase housing supply, remove infrastructural and planning bottlenecks, moderate increases in house prices and to improve affordability of housing, particularly for first time purchasers. The policy objectives and Government measures were set out in Action on House Prices in April 1998, Action on <Col N="396" /> the Housing Market in March 1999 and Action on Housing in June 2000.</P>
    <P>There is clear evidence that the Government's actions over recent years have had a significantly positive impact in the face of strongly rising demand for housing. Total new housing output in 2000 was almost 50,000 units, an increase of 7% over the 1999 total, the sixth consecutive year of record housing output. House price data for recent months indicate further moderation in the rate of increase in average house prices. There is also firm evidence that first time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market. The provision of £6 billion for social and affordable housing in the national development plan, augmented by further investment of almost £1 billion announced in Action on Housing, will ensure that the social and affordable housing needs of almost 100,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to implementing major reforms in the private rented residential sector, arising from the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector. These measures, which include establishment of a private residential tenancies board to deal with disputes between landlords and tenants, legislation to provide improved security of tenure for tenants and targeted tax and supply incentives to promote further investment in the sector, should facilitate the development of a better managed and more professional private rented sector. The Government is constantly monitoring housing developments and reviewing its policies to ensure that the unprecedented surge in housing demand associated with our economic success is met in a sustainable way.</P>

      <P>I published retail planning guidelines on 2 January 2001. These guidelines have been issued as ministerial guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Section 28 of the 2000 Act provides that planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála must have regard to any such guidelines in the performance of their planning functions.</P>
      <P>The guidelines confirm the cap of 3,000 mf7&gt;2 net retail floorspace on large food stores except in the Greater Dublin Area, where it has been increased to 3,500 mf7&gt;2. The higher cap in the greater Dublin area is in line with the report by Roger Tym &amp; Partners, published in April 1999, and has regard to the greater size and density of population in the greater Dublin area, the close proximity of residential areas to established town centres and the size of populations contained within the catchment areas of retail centres.</P>
      <P>The retail planning guidelines also contain a range of other floorspace caps and development control criteria in relation to various types of retail development. I am satisfied that the guidelines address all the complex planning issues arising from large-scale retail development and will be an essential tool for planning authorities when deciding on planning applications for retail development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for the monitoring, management and protection of water quality is assigned primarily to local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency. By international standards, Irish waters are of good quality and compare favourably to waters in other countries of the European Union. However, monitoring and reporting by the EPA has identified eutrophication, or over-enrichment of waters, as perhaps Ireland's most serious environmental pollution problem. Eutrophication is caused mainly by excess inputs of phosphorus from various sources and now affects one third of the river system. Agriculture has been identified as the single biggest contributor in this regard accounting for 73% of total phosphorus inputs. Significant inputs also arise from sewage discharges and industry.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, my Department has pursued a comprehensive, integrated strategy to tackle all sources of eutrophication. Major catchment-based projects for the establishment of water quality monitoring and management systems are well under way, or nearing completion, in relation to Lough Derg, Lough Ree, Lough Leane and the River Boyne, the River Liffey and the River Suir. Substantial investment, of over £160 million, is also being made in sewage infrastructure in these catchments. This strategy is already beginning to show evidence of some improvements in water quality. In some instances, for example, Nenagh and Athlone, where phosphorus has been incorporated in sewage treatment, there has been a significant reduction of phosphorus concentrations in the receiving waters. The recently published EPA report, River Shannon &ndash; Lake Water Quality Monitoring 1998 &amp; 1999, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library, has identified a reduction in the symptoms of eutrophication in Lough Key, Lough Ree and Lough Derg due, in part, to the impact of zebra mussels. The strategy is also underpinned by the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 (Water Quality Standards for Phosphorus) Regulations, 1998, which set clear targets for reducing phosphorus levels in rivers and lakes by end 2007.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is now promoting the establishment by local authorities of river basin management projects to address water management <Col N="399" /> in all inland and coastal waters, including groundwaters, and all sources of water pollution. These projects will facilitate implementation of the recently adopted EU Water Framework Directive which requires the achievement of good water status, as defined in the directive, generally within a 15 year time frame, in a co-ordinated programme of measures by all relevant authorities in relation to the management of water quality and quantity. Financial support is being provided by my Department for expenditure incurred by local authorities in relation to such projects.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive approach is being supported by my Department's major investment programme in sewage infrastructure facilities throughout the country. The National Development Plan, 2000-2006, provides for capital investment of £3 billion, the major portion of which will be devoted to waste water infrastructure. The investment programme places particular emphasis on the provision of phosphorus reduction facilities where a need is indicated in this regard. Discharges to waters from industrial sources are subject to licensing controls operated by local authorities and the EPA.</P>
    <P>Phosphorus losses to waters from agriculture arise from inadequate waste management at farmyard level and from leaching and run-off from land, particularly following the land spreading of slurries or the use of chemical fertilisers containing phosphorus. Facilitated by regulations which I made in 1998 to extend and strengthen their powers, by-laws were made by certain local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts to protect waters against pollution by agriculture. My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, has substantial initiatives under way to tackle phosphorus inputs from agriculture, including the rural environment protection scheme and the proposed new farm waste management scheme.</P>
    <P>A voluntary agreement has been concluded with the Irish Detergents and Allied Products Association &ndash; IDAPA &ndash; which provides for an incremental move to zero phosphate domestic laundry detergents by IDAPA members. The agreement sets targets of 55% by end June 2000, 90% by end 2001 and 95% by end 2002. The June 2000 target has been met.</P>
    <P>The most recent comprehensive report by the EPA in relation to water quality, 1995-97, indicates that nitrates in rivers are generally well within the limits &ndash; 11 mg/one nitrogen &ndash; set by EU legislation in relation to raw waters for treatment and supply as drinking water and that there was no widespread pollution of particular aquifers. The report identified localised instances of elevated levels of nitrates in certain groundwaters. The EPA has estimated that the loads of nitrogen entering water from agricultural activities far outweigh those from other sources, including waste water, and comprise 82% of the total.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> Additional protection against pollution of waters by nitrates will be provided by action programmes to be developed in relation to those areas where the levels of nitrates in groundwaters are approaching or exceeding the limits set by European legislation. As I indicated in a public statement in July 2000, the affected waters are located in counties Carlow, Cork, Kerry, Louth and Waterford. Work is under way on the identification of the catchments related to these waters and, on its completion, I will formally designate the appropriate areas as nitrate vulnerable zones &ndash; NVZs. Designation of an area as an NVZ will place higher emphasis on the measures that are already in practice. The voluntary code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates &ndash; the blue book issued in 1996 &ndash; will become mandatory in an NVZ. A primary consideration will be the management of manures and slurries. I am keeping the position under review in relation to other groundwaters and surface waters which may need additional protection.</P>
    <P>Other forms of water pollution, such as contamination by metals, synthetic organic chemicals and hydrocarbons, can damage or destroy aquatic life. While these forms of pollution are considered to be of minor significance in Ireland, reflecting the low level of heavy industry, I recently made the Water Quality (Dangerous Substances) Regulations, 2001 &ndash; SI 12 of 2001 &ndash; to assist in reducing further the discharges of these contaminants. These regulations set water quality standards for a number of substances, including certain pesticides, solvents and metals, to provide additional protection for waters and give further effect to EU Directive 76/464/EEC, the Dangerous Substances Directive. I will take such additional measures as I consider appropriate from time to time to provide for adequate management and protection of water quality to combat water pollution from all sources.</P>
    <P>In addition to the major policy, investment and regulating initiatives outlined, my Department provides grant support to An Taisce annually for administration of the blue flag scheme, which has become a symbol throughout Europe of clean bathing water. Although the overall number of blue flags awarded in 2000 &ndash; 75 &ndash; was slightly down, there has been a steady improvement in Irish bathing water quality throughout the 1990s.</P>
    <P>My Department and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources each contribute annually to the budget of the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic of which Ireland is a contracting party. The main objective of the convention is to prevent and eliminate pollution of the maritime area of the north east Atlantic, in particular through the cessation of discharges, emissions and losses of hazardous substances to the marine environment by 2020.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has engaged with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry &ndash; SIMI &ndash; the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association &ndash; IMVRA &ndash; and the Metal Merchants Association of Ireland &ndash; MMAI &ndash; with a view to the development of a producer responsibility initiative in relation to end of life vehicles &ndash; ELVs. It is intended that such an initiative would, in particular, take account of Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on end of life vehicles. This directive entered into force on 21 October 2000 and member states must implement its requirements by April 2002.</P>
      <P>The directive incorporates a number of significant requirements, including measures aimed at ensuring that relevant economic operators establish collection systems for ELVs at no cost to the final holder; ensuring that all collected ELVs are dismantled and recovered in a manner which does not cause environmental pollution; preventing waste from vehicles; increasing the recovery and recycling rates of ELVs and their components; and minimising the use of hazardous materials-substances in vehicles. At the invitation of my Department, and in anticipation of the adoption of the directive, an initial proposal for an ELV management system for Ireland was submitted by SIMI in December 1999. Following the formal adoption of the directive in October 2000 and consultation with other interested parties, including IMVRA, MMAI, relevant Government Departments and State agencies, my Department responded to the initial SIMI proposal in November 2000. A joint meeting of all relevant stakeholders is scheduled to take place in early March in order to progress the development of a practicable industry-led scheme. It is my objective to secure agreement on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme and to give effect to Directive 2000/53/EC as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>A range of accommodation is provided for homeless persons, from emergency hostel accommodation to transitional and long-term accommodation. Under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, my Department provides 90% recoupment to local authorities for expenditure on the provision of accommodation for homeless persons.</P>
      <P>The rate is agreed between the local authority and the voluntary body based on the level of need involved. My Department has recommended that the minimum rate should be £10 per bed night and this is set out in the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness. The rate of payment for accommodation provided can be reviewed at any stage and higher rates may be agreed if individual circumstances warrant it, but my Department is usually consulted in advance of any such agreement.</P>
      <P>As part of the homelessness strategy, health boards, under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children, are now assuming funding responsibility for the care and welfare needs of homeless persons, including the provision of in-house care in hostels and in other accommodation for homeless persons. Local authorities have established homeless fora, where they were not already in place, and are developing three year action plans jointly with health boards and voluntary bodies as part of the homelessness strategy. These action plans will set out clear aims and actions on how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided to homeless persons by all the agencies involved. One of the objectives of the strategy is the phasing out of the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for anything other than short-term emergency accommodation for homeless people, particularly families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has made substantial current and capital funding available to ensure that the measures outlined in the strategy are implemented. Capital spending by local authorities on accommodation for the homeless is to be doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the five years, 2001-2006. An extra £6 million per annum in current funding will be available from my Department to increase payments for the provision of hostel accommodation and to establish settlement and outreach services. Additional funding will also be available from health boards to fund care and welfare requirements. Voluntary bodies will also continue to be assisted to provide additional accommodation for homeless persons <Col N="403" /> under the voluntary housing schemes operated by my Department.</P>

      <P>Agreement has been reached by the European Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, in accordance with Community co-decision procedures, on a new directive to regulate the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment.</P>
      <P>The new directive will update the existing regulatory regime in Ireland and the Community generally in this area. It reflects advances in science and technology and practical operational experience gained since the directive it will replace &ndash; 90/220/EEC &ndash; came into effect in 1991. The main feature of the new directive is a strengthening of the safety and transparency provisions of the regulatory regime through a range of specific requirements such as new common principles for environmental risk assessment, a new ten year limit on first time consents, to place genetically modified products on the EU market, linked to a new requirement for post-release monitoring, improved labelling linked to a new requirement on traceability and new provisions for public participation in the regulatory procedures.</P>
      <P>When the directive enters into force, member states will have 18 months to transpose it into national law. In the case of Ireland, transposition will require the making of regulations, under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, to replace the relevant provisions of the Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations, 1994. The Environmental Protection Agency is the competent authority for the purposes of the 1994 regulations and that position will be maintained under the new directive.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, confers a right to retain, as a tenant, possession of a formerly rent controlled dwelling for the lifetime of the person who was the tenant at the commencement of the Act &ndash; 26 July 1982 &ndash; and for the lifetime of their spouse. Where a member or successive members of the tenant's family succeeded to the tenancy within 20 years of the commencement of the Act, the right to retain possession continues to 25 July 2002, with a minimum tenancy period of five years even where this may extend beyond that date. Successor tenants may claim a renewable lease for up to 35 years under the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1980.</P>
      <P>To obtain the up to date information necessary to address the changed situation which will apply in July 2002, local authorities throughout the country have, at the request of my Department, been undertaking a postal survey of tenants of dwellings registered with them under the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, with a view to ascertaining the number of successor tenants remaining in the sector. The majority of authorities have completed their surveys and have forwarded the data collected to my Department. However, a number still have not done so and pending their submission, I am not in a position to provide a reliable estimate of the number of successor tenants that may be affected. The information already submitted, however, appears to indicate that the final figure for such tenants will be unlikely to exceed 750. Local authorities have been asked to submit outstanding survey data without delay and this information, when received, will inform future policy decisions on this issue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The results of the statutory assessment of housing needs undertaken by local authorities at the end of March 1999 indicated a total of 39,176 households in need of local authority housing. From ongoing contacts by my Department with local authorities, it is estimated that needs have increased since 1999 by around 15%.</P>
      <P>The number of houses completed or acquired by local authorities during 1999 was 3,713. Figures in relation to houses completed-acquired, first time lettings for each local authority and voluntary housing output for 2000 are currently being compiled in my Department and will be included in the Annual Bulletin of Housing Statistics for 2000 which will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently examining local authority housing programmes for 2001 for each authority. However, I expect authorities to complete or acquire some 5,000 houses in 2001 and start an additional 7,000 houses. The Government is fully aware of the increased level of social housing need and priority is being given to tackling this need. The local authority housing programme is only one of a range of ways in which the needs of households on local authority waiting lists may be met. I am confident the enhanced multi-annual local authority housing programme, together with the increased output from the complementary social housing measures, including the voluntary housing programme and vacancies occurring in the existing stock, will enable the housing needs of around 11,000 households to be met this year compared to a provisionally estimated total of about 9,000 last year and that the increased social housing output over the coming four years will meet the needs of over 50,000 households. This level of social housing output will impact positively on the number of households on waiting lists.</P>

      <P>The position on legal actions and complaints being investigated by the European Commission in regard to environmental matters, which fall within the remit of my Department, is as follows: there are two cases currently before the European Court of Justice; the first concerns the making of Waste Management Plans; Ireland has submitted its defence and requested an oral hearing in this case, and the response of the European Court is awaited in this regard; in the second case in relation to statutory obligations primarily on certain private rural water supplies, Ireland has submitted its defence, and the Commission must lodge its reply with the European Court of Justice by 6 March 2001.</P>
      <P>The Commission has also recently issued press releases announcing its intention to initiate European Court of Justice proceedings in two further cases concerning the establishment of water quality standards for certain dangerous substances and the communication of inventories required under the PCBs and PCTs Directive.</P>

      <Quest>the steps he will take to deal with the situation highlighted in the recent report of the Environmental Protection Agency which found that almost one in ten of the State's public drinking water supplies is unsatisfactory and that a significant amount of drinking water is still bacteriologically unfit for human consumption; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[5145/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for the provision of drinking water supplies and for upholding the prescribed quality standards rests with sanitary authorities. Stringent drinking water standards are prescribed in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988 (S.I. No. 81 of 1988). The duty placed on sanitary authorities to take the necessary measures to ensure that drinking water meets these standards is performed under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency. Its most recent annual report on The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland, for 1999, published on 12 December 2000, is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The report confirms the fundamentally good quality of Irish drinking water, indicating that 96% of samples from public supplies were free of faecal coliforms and 92% of such samples were free of all coliforms. The greatest continuing problem is the presence of coliforms in mainly poorly treated or untreated private group and small private supplies, although there is a welcome increase, from 58% to 62%, in compliance by group schemes. The report notes that many of the other exceedances are marginal in nature and/or reflect naturally occurring local conditions, and that an intensive programme is in place to remedy the identified deficiencies in rural water supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of serious concern that any supply of drinking water is deficient in quality and, accordingly, the National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides for large-scale investment in water services. The provision of £3 billion under <Col N="411" /> the plan includes a particular focus on the provision of additional water treatment and distribution capacity, maintenance of water quality standards, water conservation and leakage reduction, and network rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>The rural water programme, addressing the needs of private supplies with water quality problems, will receive £420 million over the plan period. This years allocation, at £55 million, is the biggest ever and is strongly focused on remedying the water quality problems affecting privately sourced group water schemes.</P>
    <P>Several initiatives are in place to enable rural water problems to be tackled in a comprehensive and co-ordinated manner in partnership with the National Federation of Group Water Schemes. Last year I introduced a new 100% capital grant to finance the installation of essential treatment and disinfection facilities in group water schemes supplying untreated water to their members. New technologies for water treatment have been successfully tested and will be given widespread application. The federation, with the backing of my Department, is introducing a quality assurance scheme for the group water sector. Following a pilot project on source monitoring in 1999-00 a new national source monitoring programme began in August 2000 and will run for a 12 month period. The national rural water monitoring committee is in place to advise on policy in this sector. This committee has developed a strategy for a source protection scheme and pilot projects will be initiated shortly.</P>
    <P>As a back-up to the co-operative initiatives under way, the voluntary basis for tackling quality problems in the group scheme sector has also been strengthened further. Last year an amendment to the drinking water regulations set deadlines of 31 December 2003 for compliance with all quality standards related to health, and 31 December 2006 for compliance with all quality standards. To promote and give practical effect to best practice in the operation and management of water services infrastructure nationally, my Department, in association with FÁS, has established a national training and certification programme for local authority water services personnel. Training to best international standards began in 1995 for the 2000 staff concerned and is being delivered through a network of five new training centres; four are already operational and construction will begin on the fifth, in Leixlip, later this year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that all reasonable measures are being taken to remedy deficiencies in public and private water supplies as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <Quest>the input and relationship his Department has with the Dublin Transportation Initiative and the Dublin Transportation Office; the evaluation and feedback he receives on their projects having regard to his reply to Parliamentary Question number 40 of 29 June 2000; if he has satisfied himself that productive progress is being made; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office, which operates under the aegis of my Department, was established as a corporate body in 1995 under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971 to co-ordinate and monitor the implementation of the Dublin Transportation Initiative Strategy. The DTO steering committee, on which my Department is represented, has primary responsibility for conducting the business of the DTO. My Department is also represented on a number of the DTO's specialist committees.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that satisfactory progress is being made with the implementation of the DTI strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> The DTO policy document &ldquo;A Platform for Change&rdquo;, which was launched by An Taoiseach on 2 October 2000, sets out a comprehensive integrated strategy to respond to the transportation needs of the greater Dublin area, GDA, in the period to 2016. This strategy document updates and builds substantially on progress achieved under the Dublin Transportation Initiative final report already approved by the Government in 1995, taking account of the strategic planning guidelines published in 1999.</P>
    <P>Further work is being completed on the detail of the strategy, including an examination of the various demand management options available with a view to ensuring that the greatly enhanced public transport facilities, which will be provided, will be utilised to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>The total estimated capital cost of the strategy is £14.2 billion and implementation is expected to: result in a high quality public transport service being available to most people within 10 minutes walking distance of where they live; increase the share of the market accounted for by public transport from 35% to 65%; reduce congestion; improve accessibility; and result in significant environmental gains including reductions in energy use and emissions below what they would be otherwise.</P>
    <P>During the period 1994 to 2000 the Dublin Transportation Office paid out grants amounting to £71.5 million on traffic management schemes in the greater Dublin area. Under the national development plan, over £3 billion is provided to continue DTI related funding through the period 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>The DTO is currently preparing a new short-term action plan, designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures, consistent with the DTI strategy, which can be completed in the period to end 2003. This plan will be completed in the near future.</P>
    <P>Good progress was made with the implementation of the last short-term action plan, 1998-2000. For example, all 150 of the planned new buses have been delivered; work is proceeding on the planning, design and implementation of the quality bus corridor, QBC, network with four QBCs now in operation and five to be introduced before the end of April 2001; the programme of platform lengthening is well under way; delivery of the additional DART rolling stock and railcars has commenced; and the upgrading of the Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line has been completed.</P>
    <P>Finally, Dublin participated in European Car-Free Day on 22 September 2000. The aim of this event was to promote the use of public transport and alternative modes of transport. From an awareness perspective the event was very successful and will be repeated on Saturday, 22 September 2001 and on the same date annually thereafter.</P>

      <P>As indicated in reply to Question No. 389 of 24 October 2000, the framework for the national car test, NCT, which was decided by the previous Government and continued by this Government, involves its operation on a public private partnership and self-financing basis. The NCT is required under EU legislation to provide virtually universal coverage of private vehicles; accordingly only minimal exemptions have been granted from its scope.</P>
      <P>The contract for the NCT has been awarded on a competitive basis so as to ensure a high level of service and value for money to its users. In accordance with the contract, the costs of operation of the national car testing service are met by way of charges for tests and for re-tests that require the use of equipment in a test centre.</P>
      <P>Private motoring costs have not in the past received public subsidies, apart from the reliefs of VAT-VRT, motor tax and fuel tax afforded for the benefit of persons with disabilities. I do not consider that the introduction and operation of the National Car Test justifies a departure from the well established principle of non-subsidy of private motoring costs, and I do not accordingly envisage a change in present arrangements.</P>

      <P>The position regarding untreated sewage discharges set out in the recent Environmental Protection Agency report on Urban Waste Water Discharges in Ireland, which related to the 1998-99 period, is being rapidly overtaken by developments under my Department's water services investment programme. Some £3 billion has been provided in the national development plan for capital expenditure on water services in the years 2000-06. A major focus of the investment is on the expansion and upgrading of waste water infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 37 agglomerations without treatment referred to in the EPA report, the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2002, announced last July, includes schemes to provide secondary <Col N="415" /> treatment, or better, in 31 of those locations, representing almost 99% of the total effluent load. Schemes already in progress or scheduled to start in 2001 and 2002 will meet the treatment requirements for over 97% of the total load.</P>
    <P>The investment programme for 2000-02 is the first phase of a rolling three-year programme that will continue up to the end of the national development plan in 2006. Further waste water schemes will be approved in the next phase of the programme which will roll it forward to 2003.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In June 2000, the Government published its policy document, Action on Housing, which set out a comprehensive package of measures, taking account of recommendations made by Dr. Bacon in his report, The Housing Market in Ireland: An Economic Evaluation of Trends and Prospects, and including a range of improvements to the social and affordable housing schemes. The key objectives of the Government's strategy are to maximise housing output to meet the continuing strong demand for housing; curb short-term speculative demand; strengthen the position of first-time purchasers in the market; increase the supply of social and affordable housing; and improve the institutional arrangements to facilitate the delivery of housing related infrastructure and thereby increase overall housing supply.</P>
      <P>The indications to date are positive following Action on Housing. Housing output in 2000 rose by 7% over the 1999 total, to almost 50,000 units and house price data for recent months indicate further moderation in the rate of increase in average house prices. There is also firm evidence that first-time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market.</P>
      <P>Other leading indicators of housing output, such as planning permissions and availability of serviced land, are also very positive. Almost 86,500 housing units were granted planning permission in 2000, an increase of 13% on the 76,500 units granted permission in 1999 and the stock of serviced residential building land available now is very encouraging and is set to improve significantly going forward.</P>
      <P>The stamp duty changes introduced in Action on Housing were designed both to ease the burden on first-time buyers and owner occupiers and to discourage speculative investment which was negatively impacting on the ability of first-time buyers to enter the housing market. An anti-speculative tax was also introduced to discourage short-term speculative investment by those seeking to make a quick capital gains, with exemptions in certain cases. Other measures in Action on Housing include an increase in the income eligibility limits for the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes, provision of site subsidy for these schemes and an increase in the mortgage allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further measures to be implemented include the designation of strategic development zones for residential development, the completion of local authority housing strategies, and the implementation of major reforms in the private rented residential sector, arising from the recommend<Col N="417" /> ations in the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector.</P>
    <P>The Government closely monitors housing developments and will consider further targeted measures as appropriate.</P>

      <P>Motor insurance schemes whereby parties signing up to them avail of the bulk purchase of insurance cover, and the consequential savings, are an established feature of the insurance market for many years. A critical aspect of such schemes is the fact that the association or organisation in question is able to validate the bona fides of their members seeking the cover. This is an assurance to the underwriter that the member, for example, the taxi driver, being assessed for cover is operating within specified guidelines and requirements and therefore represents a risk improvement to the underwriter. Such arrangements are commonly negotiated by associations and organisations across all professions and industries, for many years, both nationally and internationally.</P>

      <P>If any individual or partnership or any body corporate carries on business under a name other than his/her own true name then the registration of a business name is obligatory under the Business Names Act, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application for registration to which the Deputy refers was received in the Companies Registration Office on 26 January 2001. It reveals <Col N="418" /> that the business name was adopted by the applicant on 25 January 1994. No previous application was lodged with the CRO in respect of this business name.</P>
    <P>Section 38 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, introduced the requirement that a copy of a business name registration certificate must, in certain specified circumstances, accompany an application for a liquor licence and renewal or transfer of a liquor licence. This legislative change has encouraged that particular sector to comply with the terms of the Business Names Act, 1963, and consequently has contributed significantly to the recent increase in the workload of the business names side of the CRO. To illustrate this point, 5,264 business names applications were received in the CRO for a five-month period up to end January 2000 as compared with 12,464 for the same period up to end January 2001.</P>
    <P>The office has recently moved additional resources to the business name area to cope with the demand, which is not expected to last. Applications are dealt with according to date of receipt. Assuming the documentation is in order, I would expect that the relevant certificate to issue on or about 8 March 2001.</P>

      <P>Only eight of the 41 member states of the Council of Europe have signed its Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers, 1977. Those states are France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.</P>
      <P>The substance of this convention was incorporated into the Council of Europe's Revised European Social Charter, 1996, which Ireland signed and ratified on 4 November 2000.</P>
      <P>Articles 18 and 19 of the Revised European Social Charter &ndash; the Right to Engage in a Gainful Occupation in the Territory of Other Parties (Member States of the Council of Europe) and the Right of Migrant Workers and Their Families to Protection and Assistance &ndash; are the main articles dedicated to the issue of migrant workers.</P>
      <P>Ireland signed and ratified the revised charter because it is a new human rights treaty which updates the rights protected in the original European Social Charter of 1961 in areas such as employment, social protection, non-discrimination, education and health. It also incorporates the Convention of the Rights of Migrant Workers, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no supervisory mechanism within the Council of Europe in relation to the 1977 Con<Col N="419" /> vention as such. However, a consultative committee meets occasionally to discuss its operation. With regard to the Revised Social Charter, there is a regular reporting requirement on all contracting parties, that is, member states of the Council of Europe which have signed and ratified the Revised European Social Charter, to submit detailed national reports on the implementation of the revised charter. These national reports are subject to detailed scrutiny by different committees within the Council of Europe, and ultimately by the Committee of Foreign Ministers.</P>
    <P>This international system of supervision monitors the effective application of both the original and revised charters by the 28 states that have signed and ratified either of them to date. In a number of cases, the effect of this supervision has led to improvements in the social legislation and practice in the member state concerned.</P>
    <P>Given the above arrangements, Ireland has chosen the more ambitious option for the protection of migrant workers within the framework of the Council of Europe's international instruments by signing and ratifying the Revised Social Charter last November. I am satisfied therefore, that this obviates the need for Ireland to sign and ratify the 1977 Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers.</P>

      <P>In November 2000, the Economic Policy Committee of the European Union produced a study on population ageing and its implications for pensions policy. This study included all member states and contained demographic projections based on a range of assumptions on fertility rates and net immigration. This led to projections of future economic growth and likely changes in the cost of public-funded pensions as a percentage of <Col N="425" /> national income arising from projected increases in the population aged 65 and over.</P>
      <P>The assumptions on net immigration used in the study for each member state are set out in the following table. In the case of Ireland it was projected that net immigration would be 17,500 in 2000 before falling to 10,000 by 2005. Thereafter it is assumed that net immigration to Ireland is maintained at 5,000 persons per annum.</P>

    <P>Given these assumptions dependency ratios for member states were estimated. These are defined as the population aged over 65 and under 19 as a proportion of the working age population. A full set of these results is included in the study which I am sending to the Deputy. Ireland's dependency ratio according to this study is estimated at 72.5% in 2001, rising to 84.8% by the end of the projections period. This compares with a rate of 89.5% for the EU-15 by 2050.</P>
    <P>The study did not test the sensitivity of the results to different immigration assumptions, beyond that in the table.

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall objective of Government policy is to support the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector in harmony with other marine users. The capacity of a water body such as Lough Swilly is a concept dependent on a very wide range of factors at any one time. In this context it should be noted that aquaculture is itself affected by other activities and depends fundamentally on a clean environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have no proposals to commission a study on the overall aquaculture potential of Lough Swilly, it is important to note that, in accordance with the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, each application for aquaculture licensing is considered on its merits and takes account of such <Col N="428" /> matters as any adverse impacts on wild fisheries, navigational and safety issues and the impact of the development on the marine environment, as well as other users of the marine resource. Furthermore, all salmon farming licensing proposals must be accompanied by a detailed environmental impact statement. In addition, the establishment under the 1997 Act of an independent aquaculture licences appeals board, enables appeals to be taken against licensing decisions.</P>
    <P>The licensing framework and ancillary supports such as co-ordinated local aquaculture management systems are already facilitating the development of aquaculture on a sustainable and environmentally appropriate basis. CLAMS aims to involve all local interests, including anglers, tourism interests, fish farmers, statutory agencies, environmentalists and local representatives in jointly managing the various activities in a designated area. CLAMS is currently operating successfully in a number of areas with significant aquaculture activity and a draft CLAMS plan for Lough Swilly is currently nearing completion.</P>
    <P>Production limits are incorporated into each salmon farming licence. The current limit on salmon production in the lough is 1,000 tonnes per annum at three licensed sites. While shellfish licences do not include limitations on licensed production, those areas within which the farming activity may take place are defined under licence. Production is dependent on growth rates which vary with conditions such as location, environmental factors and operation. Estimated aquaculture production in the lough last year was some 1,150 tonnes of which 150 tonnes related to shellfish production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The UN High Commission for Refugees is one of the most important agencies within the UN development system, marking its 50th anniversary in December 2000. While it was originally intended to have a lifespan of only three years, the UNHCR's mandate has been continually renewed in the years since 1950. With more than one million people forced to flee their homes in 1999, the problem of forced displacement remains a major concern of the international community into the 21st century. Today, UNHCR activities assist 22 million people worldwide. The UNHCR and the new High Commissioner, former Dutch Prime Minister, Ruud Lubbers, face huge challenges in areas such as Chechnya, Kosovo, East Timor, Afghanistan, Congo, Sierra Leone and Angola. In recent years UNHCR workers have paid with their lives to protect refugees fleeing conflict.</P>
      <P>In line with established policy, the UNHCR is one of the largest recipients of Ireland Aid funding. In 1999, Ireland Aid made a voluntary contribution of £1.31 million to UNHCR's core resources. This rose to £1.6 million in 2000. In 2001, the voluntary core contribution rose to £3 million, not earmarked in its entirety and representing an increase of more than 87%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> Ireland Aid has also entered into a multi-annual funding arrangement with the UNHCR, covering the three year period from 2001 to 2003. Indicative figures of £4.65 million and £5.5 million for core contributions in 2002 and 2003 respectively have been conveyed to UNHCR. Towards the end of this three year cycle, Ireland Aid will seek consultations with the UNHCR with a view to evaluating future contributions. A multi-annual funding framework gives the High Commission much needed financial predictability in planning its future programmes and activities.</P>
    <P>Ireland pledged this year's contribution at an emergency meeting of UNHCR donors in Geneva in December 2000 which was convened to deal with the High Commission's acute liquidity crisis. Ireland's greatly increased contribution in 2001 is a mark of our strong commitment to the vital work which the UNHCR carries out on behalf of the world's displaced at a time when demands on the agency are at an all time high. This level of funding should place Ireland among the UNHCR's top 15 donors and is real evidence of how our expanded aid budget can help us play a leadership role in responding to a global humanitarian emergency.</P>
    <P>In addition to core contributions, we fund specific programmes under the aegis of the High Commission. In 2000 Ireland Aid allocated £200,000 to UNHCR activities in East Timor where the UNHCR has taken on the role of providing shelter to the returning refugees. In 1999, £1.25 million was granted to UNHCR programmes in East Timor, Kosovo and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some £900,000 of this amount was allocated in response to the return of refugees and internally displaced persons to Kosovo during the Balkans crisis. In 1998, humanitarian assistance to the UNHCR totalled £500,000 and focused on Angola, Mali, Niger, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Somalia.</P>
    <P>Officials from Ireland Aid met the UNHCR in Geneva at the end of January to discuss how best we can use our increased contribution to help the <Col N="432" /> UNHCR in overcoming the challenges it faces. The UNHCR has been involved in processing arrangements for asylum applications in Ireland for a number of years. Under the Refugee Act, 1996, the role of UNHCR in this regard is specifically recognised.</P>
    <P>The provision of funding towards the cost of the operation of the UNHCR office in Dublin is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Such contributions are subject to compliance with all relevant public financial procedures and may be counted as part of Ireland's official development assistance. It is understood from that Department that approval was given for funding the location of a UNHCR liaison officer in Dublin who took up office in Dublin on 5 April 1998. The approval covered the period up to 31 March 1999 and was not renewed. Funding has also been provided by that Department towards the rental costs in respect of UNHCR accommodation at 27 Upper Fitzwilliam Street, Dublin 2, from April 1999 up to 31 December 2001. The annual contributions by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform towards the UNHCR office in Dublin for the three years commencing April 1998 were $110,658 (£75,000), £38,400 and £39,426. A further sum of £31,878 will be paid between April 2001 and 31 December 2001.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to the more than 4,500 highly quali<Col N="433" /> fied and experienced women and men of over 140 nationalities, among them many Irish, serving as volunteer specialists and field workers in developing countries throughout the world.</P>
      <P>The United Nations Volunteers Programme was established in 1970, at the request of the member states, by the UN General Assembly, to serve as an operational partner in development co-operation. Since then, more than 20,000 people have given generously of their time, expertise and energy to serve as UN Volunteers. UNV is unique within the UN family and as an international volunteer undertaking. It reports to the United Nations Development Programme and works through UNDP's country offices around the world. It is funded by voluntary contributions from UN member states. Volunteers are professionals from more than 100 different fields of expertise. Many have backgrounds in specific areas of medicine, agriculture, technology or economics.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises and highly values the important work of UN Volunteers and supports their activities in a practical way by contributing annually to the cost of the UN Volunteer Programme. Many other UN member states do likewise. In recognition of this, the International Year of the Volunteer, our 2001 contribution to UNV will be £600,000 (761,843 euros), an increase of 100% over last year. Our contributions in the period 1993 to 2000, made through the Ireland Aid Programme, amounted to almost £2 millon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special leave without pay is available to the staff of my Department who wish to devote per<Col N="434" /> sonal time to voluntary organisations engaged in, for example, community welfare or charitable initiatives. I have asked the personnel section of the Department to look sympathetically at any applications for leave from staff members in connection with the International Year of the Volunteer. As a member of Government I readily acknowledge the importance of maintaining the values of community spirit, particularly given the pace of the changing times in which we live. It is especially appropriate, therefore, that 2001 should be the International Year of the Volunteer. Despite personal pressures, a great many people continue to devote time to the activities of voluntary organisations at local, regional and national level. The Government actively promotes and helps to support and resource such organisations and as a member of the Government I will continue to play an active role in that regard.</P>

      <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including ADSL, is a matter in the first instance for the companies who now operate in a fully liberalised market. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.</P>
      <P>I have, in recent years, put in place a number of initiatives which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in Ireland, particularly those in rural areas. Those initiatives include the funding of extended communications networks under both the 1994 to 1999 national development plan and the 2000 to 2006 national development plan. Earlier this year I announced the first round of funding under the 2000 to 2006 national development plan. This funding of approximately 70 million euros will support a total investment of about 200 million euros in services providing broadband access around the country. County Monaghan will benefit from a number of these projects. The development of a new fibreoptic backbone on the ESB network will include Monaghan, as will a wireless local loop service being developed by Chorus. Both these network extensions are being part funded by the Government and, while they do not specifically include ADSL service, they do commit to providing broadband high-speed communications services using other technologies. Companies operating in the liberalised market are free to deliver services such as ADSL outside any contracts agreed with the Government under the national development plan and within the current regulatory framework.</P>

Personnel who normally reside outside barracks are not deducted on those occasions when their duty requires them to stay in barracks. As members of the Reserve are part-time and do not reside in barracks, the question of deductions for rations and accommodation should not have arisen.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall strategy for the future development of the Reserve Defence Force will be based on the report of the special steering group, which I established in January 1998. That group reported in September 1999. A thorough, comprehensive and in-depth study of the Reserve was undertaken, involving a very considerable amount of work both by a military board, established by the then Chief of Staff, and latterly by the steering group itself. The steering group met each of the Permanent Defence Force representative associations and also met on three occasions with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association.</P>
      <P>I formally launched the steering group report on 25 November 2000 at a special briefing for the southern region in Thurles organised by the military authorities for serving members of the Reserve. A similar briefing for the western region took place in Athlone on 2 December 2000. A third briefing was held in Dublin on 14 December 2000. I am pleased that the various recommendations contained in the steering group report have been broadly accepted as providing a general foundation on which the development of the Reserve Defence Force can proceed in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised by the military authorities that a board has been set up at Defence Forces headquarters to formulate specific plans for the implementation of the steering group recommendations. I am further advised that, under the aegis of this board, structures have been put in place in each brigade and in the Naval Service to facilitate consultation with FCA and Slua Muirí personnel throughout the country. Given the dependence of the Reserve on voluntary service, I am anxious that there should be an ongoing process of con<Col N="437" /> sultation before proposals are finalised. The military authorities have now started upon that process by way of the series of three preliminary regional briefings late last year and by the launch of the steering group report. The military authorities have also advised that rank restructuring, a transition strategy for rank imbalance and qualification convergence will be considered as part of the overall restructuring plan for the Reserve Defence Force.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new Reserve Force as envisaged by the steering group will be determined in the course of a detailed implementation process. That process will comprehend the drafting and development of a Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan which will be based on the steering group's report. The implementation of the structural and organisational changes will require about six years to bring to completion. The military authorities will consider and recommend detailed proposals for the restructuring of Reserve units within each brigade area and in the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>So that senior Reserve Defence Force officers can serve and influence reserve activities at the highest level, the steering group recommended the creation of four new lieutenant-colonel appointments within the Reserve, these appointments being part of the integrated element of the Reserve.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army Reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army Reserve, organised into three Reserve brigades.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the steering group was particularly mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current Reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread.</P>

The group provides service to a number of Gaeltacht areas across the country. While the group allocates funding to the areas concerned, the usage of the funding is reported centrally and input on a single computerised financial control programme as is the norm for the other Leader companies. The financial information of Leader local action groups is published in each company's annual accounts in accordance with company law. I am arranging to have a copy of the MFG accounts to be forwarded to the Deputy.

      <P>The person named applied on 34 animals under the 2000 cattle headage scheme. As stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 116 of 7 December 2000, an examination of the application showed that one of the animals applied on, animal tag number 151265850125, which was declared on the application as having been born on 22 May 2000, was, in fact, registered on my Department's animal birth registration database as having been born on 14 June 2000, two weeks after the application under the 2000 cattle headage scheme was received. My Department wrote to the person named on 24 October 2000 advising him that he was ruled out of the cattle headage scheme for two years, in accordance with Clause 31(b) of the terms and conditions governing the scheme. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department setting out any facts which he wished to put forward to support his case. The person named replied to my Department on 9 January 2001 stating that he had made an error when registering the date of birth, and that it had been corrected. The exact date of birth of the animal in question is being investigated at present, and my Department is writing to the person named in the matter.</P>

      <P>All designated special areas of conservation are classified as target areas under the rural environmental protection scheme. Under measure A of REPS, which was called Supplementary Measure A in the previous scheme, eligible target area lands attract the following rates of payment: £190.59 &ndash; 242 &ndash; per hectare up to and including the first 40 hectares; <Col N="441" /> £18.90 &ndash; 24 &ndash; per hectare for areas over 40 hectares and up to and including 80 hectares and £14.18 &ndash; 18 &ndash; per hectare for areas over 80 hectares and up to a maximum of 120 hectares. The rates quoted came into effect in 1999 when the previous REP scheme was revised to include Supplementary Measure A. Up to then, SAC lands attracted a maximum payment of £147.27 &ndash; 187 &ndash; per hectare and this rate was payable on a maximum area of 40 hectares. The new REP scheme which commenced on 27 November 2000 also includes a new provision for farmers who have some non-commonage target area land, including SAC land, but opt not to put their entire holding into REPS. By farming the target area land to the specifications of REPS Measure A, and following a nutrient management plan on the rest of the holding, they are entitled to payment of 242 per hectare on the target area subject to a maximum of ten hectares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme enables qualifying persons to purchase a new car every two years free of vehicle registration tax, VRT, and VAT to a maximum of £7,500 if the qualifying person is the driver, and £12,500 if the passenger. In addition, the scheme provides for the refund of excise on up to 600 gallons of fuel and for an exemption from annual road tax. It is estimated that the scheme cost some £22 million in 2000, excluding the annual road tax costs. The mobility allowance, which is a monthly payment administered by the health boards, provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings &ndash; for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of the allowance is being doubled to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April next, and it had been envisaged that from that date persons who benefit from the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' (tax concessions) scheme would be unable to also avail of the mobility allowance. By definition, the beneficiaries of the tax-based scheme already have access to transport which is heavily subsidised by the State, and the object of the new arrangement is to target the increased mobility allowance at incapacitated people who do not enjoy these advantages. I have since been considering this proposal <Col N="443" /> in the light of concerns expressed to me by a number of Deputies about the impact on some affected individuals of complete cessation of the mobility allowance, and have decided that while the increased rate of £90 per month will, as intended, be given only to people who are not also enjoying the tax subsidies, those benefiting from both schemes should retain the mobility allowance at the existing rate of £45 per month.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked for information about the utilisation of these schemes. The Revenue Commissioners administer the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme which, as indicated, allows for the purchase every two years of a new car free of VRT and VAT, subject to certain limits. The number who availed of the VRT and VAT concession over each of the past two years is as follows:</P>

      <Col N="444" /> Based on the numbers who claim relief from excise duty on fuel on an ongoing basis, it is estimated that the total number of beneficiaries under the scheme is in the region of 7,000. At end December 2000, the mobility allowance administered by the health boards was being paid to 2,937 people. However, as it was never intended that individuals should benefit from both schemes the data from the two agencies has not been integrated. Accordingly, it is not possible to identify the extent of overlap between the two schemes.</P>

In addition, the total amount of liabilities determined in the year as a result of the DIRT look-back audits of financial institutions was £173,292,786, which has been paid in full.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the difference of £11,000 between one earner and two earner married couples arises from the Government's policy of band widening to provide each income earner with his or her own standard rate band. In the 2001 budget, I increased the standard rate band for married one earning couples to £29,000 and the combined standard rate band for married two earning couples to £40,000, with up to £29,000 transferable between the spouses.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners increasing the band for married one earning couples by £11,000 and allowing full transferability between spouses of the £40,000 band available to married two earning couples would cost approximately £290 million in a full year. This estimate assumes the enactment of the changes announced in the 2001 budget and is based on 2001 incomes data.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>In so far as the asylum process is concerned, the arrangements for unaccompanied minor asylum seekers in Ireland are governed by the provisions of section 8(5) of the Refugee Act, 1996. Section 8(5)(<i>a</i>) of the Act provides that &ldquo;where it appears to an immigration officer or an authorised officer that a child under the age of 18 years, who has either arrived at the frontiers of the State or has entered the State, is not in the custody of any person, the officer shall, as soon as practicable, so inform the health board in whose functional area the child is and thereupon the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, shall apply in relation to the child&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 8(5)(<i>b</i>) provides that &ldquo;where it appears to the health board concerned, on the basis of information available to it, that an application for a declaration should be made by or on behalf of a child referred to in paragraph (<i>a</i>), the health board shall arrange for the appointment of an officer of the health board or such other person as it may determine to make an application on behalf of the child&rdquo;. If the health board decides that an application for a declaration as a refugee should be made on behalf of an unaccompanied minor, the application will be dealt with as a matter of priority by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The processing of applications for refugee status from unaccompanied minors has a number of child-specific features and has regard to the UNHCR's guidelines on policies and procedures in dealing with unaccompanied children seeking asylum as well as the relevant paragraphs of the UNHCR's procedures handbook and the EU Council Resolution on Unaccompanied Minors who are Nationals of Third Countries &ndash; 26 June 1997. Unaccompanied minors are only interviewed in the presence of a health board rep<Col N="447" /> resentative. The question of appointment of such representatives is a matter for the health board.</P>
    <P>Co-ordinated guidelines for dealing with unaccompanied minor asylum seekers are currently being developed in my Department in consultation with the Department of Health and Children, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and representatives of the health boards. Under the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, the agencies with primary responsibility for unaccompanied minor asylum seekers are the health boards. The provision of specific services such as health, education, social and community welfare services are matters for the appropriate Departments and statutory agencies, in consultation with the health boards, and would be the responsibility of the individual Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>In relation to the number of unaccompanied minors who applied for asylum in 1998, 1999 and during each month of 2000, the information made available to me by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner is set out in the following tabular statement:</P>

      <P>Many voluntary organisations apply to the health promotion unit each year for funding for various projects. However, the budget for assisting such organisations is limited and submissions for funding need to be accompanied by well structured proposals which address the aims and objectives outlined in the national health promotion strategy. The unit will continue to examine and, as far as possible, support each application that fulfil these criteria. The Deputy should note that the health boards also provide assistance at a local level to such organisations.</P>

      <P>Articles 9.1 and 9.2 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, allowed health boards to assess the ability of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care. The provision which allowed for this assessment was deleted from 1 January 1999. This amendment was made because the provisions in question were not consistent with the assessment procedures adopted in the granting of medical cards by health boards or in the social assistant payment schemes administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family <Col N="449" /> Affairs, wherein there is no consideration of the financial circumstances of adult sons and/or daughters of applicants.</P>
      <P>However, I feel it is important to state that legal advice received from the Office of the Attorney General indicates that there is no legal liability on the State to make retrospective payments in relation to family circumstances. Nonetheless, in the interests of fairness and natural justice, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision and my colleagues in Government agree. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
      <P>A group representing the Department and the health boards/Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving,<i> inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete.

      <P>The price of drugs and medicines, ex manufacture, in Ireland has been subject to control since 1972 through the mechanism of formal multi-annual agreements with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA &ndash; formerly the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, FICI &ndash; which provides that the maximum price to the wholesaler of any new item of medicine introduced to the market and covered by the agreement shall not, on the date of notification, exceed the currency adjusted UK wholesale price or the average of a basket of EU countries, whichever is the lower. Accordingly, Irish prices for the ingredient cost of prescription medicines are generally in line with prices in the UK. A price freeze is also in place in regard to the prices charged for existing products.</P>
      <P>The manufacturers of the product referred to by the Deputy notified my Department of their intention to introduce a 28 pack size.

The product concerned is imported from the UK and the change in pack size is in line with the UK patient pack initiative and the pricing is in line with the currency converted UK price. In view of the demand for and importance of this product, my Department deemed it appropriate to accept the revised arrangements.</P>

      <P>In 1984, the Government published Planning for the Future, the report of a study group set up to examine our psychiatric services. The report recommended that psychiatric care should be primarily community based and that there should be a shift away from the psychiatric hospital being the focal point of the service. Successive Governments have supported this policy and the shift in mental health care from an institutional to a community based setting has resulted in many improvements.</P>
      <P>The aim is to provide each individual patient with the best possible care in the most appropriate setting. Patients are only discharged from in-patient psychiatric care when their clinical condition warrants it. In view of the positive benefits that have resulted for so many patients there are no plans to revise the Government's policy in this area.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to a recent radio interview when I referred to the assessment of need which is undertaken in relation to persons with an intellectual disability who are on the national intellectual disability database. At a minimum, an annual review of the circumstances of each person on the database should be undertaken to update details of their current service provision and to identify any current or future service needs. My Department's policy in relation to these reviews is that they should be attended by the staff working with the individual concerned, including multi-disciplinary support staff and family members or other persons close to and in regular contact with them. Following on the concerns expressed during the above mentioned interview regarding this review process, I requested officials from my Department to bring both these concerns and the policy in relation to reviews to the attention of the health boards and Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent statutory assessment of housing needs, which was undertaken in March 1999, indicated that there were 3,640 homeless persons in the city of Dublin comprising 1,774 adult males, 990 adult females and 876 children. The 1999 assessment of the number of homeless persons was based on a much broader definition of homeless persons than the assessment undertaken in 1996 and includes those with no accom<Col N="457" /> modation, those in hostels and in health board accommodation and those staying with friends. Some would be staying in temporary accommodation with family or friends until suitable accommodation becomes available. In 1996, the assessment indicated that there were 1,447 homeless persons in Dublin. My Department does not have information on the number of homeless persons for 1997 and 1998. The next statutory assessment of housing needs, including the number of homeless persons, will take place in March next year.</P>
    <P>A key element of the Government's integrated strategy on homelessness is the recognition that there is a need to provide additional accommodation, both transitional and sheltered, to allow people who are living in emergency hostel accommodation to move to accommodation that is more suitable to their needs. Settlement programmes will be established to encourage and support hostel residents in their move to alternative accommodation and this will also help to free up spaces in emergency hostels.</P>
    <P>The Government has made substantial current and capital funding available to ensure that the measures outlined in the strategy are implemented. Capital spending by local authorities on accommodation for the homeless is to be doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the five years, 2001-06. An extra £6 million per annum in current funding will be available from my Department to increase payments for the provision of hostel accommodation and to establish settlement and outreach services. Additional funding will also be available from health boards to fund care and welfare requirements. Voluntary bodies will also continue to be assisted to provide additional accommodation for homeless persons under the voluntary housing scheme operated by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the most recent national inventory of zoned serviced land, based on returns from individual local authorities, were published in the September quarter 2000 housing statistics bulletin, copies of which are in the Oireachtas Library. The results show that the position in relation to the stock of serviced building land is encouraging and is set to improve significantly. In Dublin, for example, the supply of zoned and serviced land currently exceeds 1,800 hectares, providing sufficient land for over 67,000 housing units.</P>
      <P>The Government decided last year to establish a national public property register containing information on lands and buildings in the ownership of Government Departments, agencies and bodies operating under their aegis, including non-commercial State bodies, health boards, local authorities and certain education bodies. The register will determine whether there are lands or buildings in the ownership of the State which can be used for housing, education, recreation or other functions for which the State has responsibility. Returns from all Government Departments have been submitted to the Department of Finance. Returns from local authorities are due to be submitted at the end of this month. The Office of Public Works will start work shortly on compiling the register based on the returns submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information on the total acreage of derelict or unused sites in the greater Dublin area is not available in my Department. Under the Derelict Sites Act, 1990, it is the duty of a local authority to take all reasonable steps to ensure that any land in its area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site. As part of their duty, local <Col N="459" /> authorities are required to maintain a register of derelict sites in their areas. While the register incorporates a map enabling any land entered on to the register to be traced, I understand that local authorities do not record the acreage of the sites in the register.</P>
    <P>Dublin local authorities, in particular Dublin Corporation, are constantly seeking to acquire suitable infill sites that can be used for the construction of local authority housing.</P>

      <P>The EPA's new Air Quality Monitoring Annual Report 1999, copies of which have been placed in the Oireachtas Library, details air quality recorded at all monitoring stations in 1999, including those in County Kildare, in relation to various air pollutants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report shows that levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide, SOf7&gt;2, recorded at Kildare monitoring stations &ndash; Leixlip, Celbridge, Naas and Newbridge &ndash; in the period April 1999 to March 2000 complied with national and EU air quality standards. It also addresses the measurement of SOf7&gt;2 levels in Leixlip, at much higher levels than those recorded at other sites. I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 113 and 114 of 22 June 2000 in this regard. No clear reason is identified for the <Col N="461" /> apparently anomalous high summer time SOf7&gt;2 levels and details of the additional measurement regime now in place to determine the cause of these readings are included in the report. I understand that the elevated SOf7&gt;2 readings have not recently recurred. The matter continues to be investigated by Kildare County Council and the EPA on a precautionary basis and current readings give no cause for concern.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 33 of 1999), designate the EPA as the competent body for assessing ambient air quality in Ireland. This requires,<i> inter alia</i>, ensuring that air quality monitoring equipment is accurate and in accordance with the requirements of European quality assurance standards. My Department has no role in assessing the equipment used. However, it is understood that the reference method for SOf7&gt;2 monitoring in the relevant EU directive, due to come into force on 21 July 2001, is now being used at Leixlip.</P>

      <P>Regional traffic management grants applicable to the county boroughs of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford were introduced as part of the non-national roads programme in 2000. The 2001 non-national road grants which I announced on 5 February last allocated £1.75 million for this purpose in 2001 &ndash; £700,000 to Cork Corporation and £350,000 each to Galway, Limerick and Waterford Corporations.</P>
      <P>Discretionary improvement grants are also allocated to county councils as part of the non-national roads programme.

      <P>Repak Limited was established in 1997 by Irish industry as a voluntary compliance scheme to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste, so as to achieve Ireland's recovery and recycling targets under Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste. Fees from member businesses finance Repak Limited activities.</P>
      <P>Revenue generated has, to date, been applied mainly to support the collection and recovery of packaging waste from the domestic waste stream, and in this regard funding has been provided in support of segregated collection initiatives in Dublin, Gandon Enterprises limited, the rehab recycling partnership, and a number of companies engaged in waste recovery activities.</P>
      <P>In addition, Repak Limited has recently initiated a new payments scheme to incentivise the recovery of additional volumes of packaging waste by waste contractors nationally. Repak Limited is also prepared to make funding available to assist local authorities in the establishment of segregated household waste collection services such as that initiated last year in the Dublin region.</P>
      <P>In light of Ireland's obligations under EU Directive 94/62/EC and the position indicated by the national waste database report for 1998, I appointed consultants to review the policies and measures in place for achieving our packaging waste recovery targets and, in particular, to evaluate the performance of Repak Limited to date, the prospects for achieving Ireland's packaging waste recovery target for 2001, having regard to the activities of Repak Limited and other relevant or prospective developments, and the additional measures or structures which appear to be required in order the meet Ireland's packaging waste recycling-recovery targets for 2006.</P>
      <P>In undertaking the review, the appointed consultants were mandated to make recommendations regarding further measures that could be undertaken by Repak Limited to support the recovery of packaging waste from the municipal waste stream, increase the recovery rate for packaging waste generally and support the development of indigenous reprocessing capacity for packaging waste.</P>
      <P>The consultants' final report was received recently and is under detailed consideration in my Department. As outlined above, the primary function of Repak Limited is to support the recycling of packaging waste arisings. It has no specific function in relation to packaging waste minimisation. However, the fees structure applicable to Repak members, which is based on the quantity and nature of packaging placed on the market, directly incentivises minimisation and reuse of packaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Repak Limited is required to regularly notify <Col N="465" /> local authorities of members located within their functional areas and local authorities are required to specify such information in public registers. It is understood that a full list of Repak members is accessible on the company's website or is otherwise available from the company.</P>
    <P>Details of fees payable by individual Repak members are not published as such fees are based on the amount of packaging placed on the market and there are issues of commercial confidentiality involved. However, Repak Limited is required to publish annual reports incorporating audited statements of accounts.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that useful progress has been made by Repak Limited since it became operational in July 1997 but that, as with any such initiative, there is scope for ongoing improvement in the range and effectiveness of its activities, as experience is gained and expertise is developed. My Department will liaise closely with Repak Limited and other relevant bodies with regard to the implementation of appropriate measures identified in recent consultants' reports with a view to achieving the recovery and recycling targets specified in EU Directive 94/62/EC.</P>

      <P>The following table sets out in respect of the environmental services operational programme, 1994-99, the variations at sub-programme level between the level of the EU aid committed by the European Commission to the programme and EU funding in receipt of actual expenditure incurred.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1999 there was a cumulative shortfall in take-up of EU aid of some &ndash; 8.3 million. This reflected, <i>inter alia</i>, an additional allocation to the water services sub-programme made late in the period of the programme &ndash; December 1999 &ndash; and the need for relevant environmental licensing requirements to be met in respect of the waste sub-programme.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the programme, commitments could be entered into up to 31 December 1999 with expenditure being incurred in 2000. While the outturn figures for 2000 are currently being compiled, the indications are that total expenditure was sufficient to ensure that any shortfall in take up of EU aid was insignificant.</P>

      <P>There are no grants available from my Department specifically for the purpose of thermally upgrading houses. There are, however, a number of targeted options currently available to assist especially vulnerable groups such as lower income households and elderly persons to secure necessary improvement works to their houses. These include the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the essential repairs grant scheme and the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme, all administered by local authorities, and the task force on special housing aid for the elderly which is administered by the local health board.</P>
      <P>In addition, many effective measures to improve energy efficiency in houses can be achieved at negative or zero equivalent annual cost to the householder. The national climate change strategy, recently adopted by the Government, provides for intensification of educational and awareness programmes being undertaken by the Irish Energy Centre to promote these options and to fill the existing information gap for consumers. Under the strategy, the new house grant will be redesigned so that larger grants are available towards more efficient houses.</P>
      <P>Since 1976, all new local authority housing has been built with wall cavity, attic and floor insulation. The standards of insulation required have been progressively improved in 1982, 1991 and, most recently, following the 1997 revision of the building regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> My Department financially assists local authorities in upgrading, renovating and redeveloping their housing stock through the remedial works scheme and funding for regeneration and redevelopment projects. Works under the remedial works scheme must comply with the building regulations. The extent of works carried out to dwellings varies from project to project. Where an extensive programme of refurbishment works is carried out, measures are taken to improve thermal insulation in accordance with the building regulations. Some 14,500 dwellings have been refurbished since the inception of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Government's 1998 policy statement on waste management &ndash; Changing Our Ways &ndash; which has as its main aim a radical reduction in national reliance on landfill, recognised that the construction industry has the primary responsibility to ensure the environmentally sound management of construction and demolition waste. In the statement, the industry was challenged to treat construction and demolition waste as a resource and to take practical steps to ensure the recycling of at least 50% of such waste within five years, and at least 85% over a 15-year period. The industry was invited to devise and implement a coherent programme of voluntary measures, involving effective least-cost solutions to meet these national targets.</P>
      <P>In response, a dedicated task force was established by the Forum for the Construction Industry to co-ordinate the development of a voluntary industry-wide programme to meet the proposed recovery targets.

      <P>Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste requires Ireland to achieve a recovery rate of <Col N="469" /> 25% for such waste by 1 July 2001, and a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005, with associated recycling targets. Article 6 of the directive provides that the Council and the European Parliament shall, before 1 January 2001, and on the basis of proposals from the European Commission, set recovery and recycling targets for 2005 for the Community as a whole. The Commission has not yet formally submitted such proposals, though they are understood to be under preparation, with a view to submission to Council by 30 June 2001.</P>
      <P>The EPA's national waste database report for 1998 indicated that an estimated 100,905 tonnes of packaging waste was recovered in that year, representing a recovery rate of 14.8%. I am satisfied that further progress has been made in the interim and expect shortly to receive an EPA report on estimated packaging waste recovery during 1999. My Department will liaise closely with Repak Limited and other relevant bodies with regard to the implementation of appropriate measures identified in recently completed consultancy studies with a view to ensuring the achievement of our recovery and recycling targets under EU Directive 94/62/EC.</P>

      <P>The largest European reprocessor of PET &ndash; plastic containers &ndash; is located in Ireland. Post-consumer PET is reprocessed at this facility into synthetic fibres that have a wide range of uses. However, PET containers must firstly undergo initial shredding and treatment, to stringent specifications, before such reprocessing. To date, only two facilities in Europe, located in France and the Netherlands, have been able to undertake this necessary pre-treatment. Accordingly, the recovery of PET containers, involving their separate collection, export to mainland Europe, treatment and re-importing for reprocessing, has not generally been pursued in Ireland because of the economics involved.</P>
      <P>It is understood that an Irish recycling operation has recently purchased plant and equipment which may enable it to undertake the pre-treatment of PET containers. If this is found to be the case, it would be my objective to secure agreement on a producer responsibility initiative for the collection and recovery of PET containers as soon as possible. My Department has already held initial discussions with relevant stakeholders in this regard.</P>

      <P>Under the operational programme for environmental services, 1994-99, grant-aid was provided to assist in the development by the private sector of plastic recycling capacity. EU / Exchequer support of £100 million will be available under the National Development Plan 2000-06, through the regional operational programmes in respect of the provision of waste recovery infrastructure generally. Details of the proposed grants scheme are being finalised and will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards and neither I nor my Department have any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>I outlined in my reply to parliamentary question reference No. 4399/00, which I answered on 15 February 2001, the manner in which supplementary welfare allowance claims from people who have left direct provision without clear justification are dealt with.</P>
      <P>The person concerned had been in receipt of a reduced basic SWA payment of £15 per week having left direct provision. She then moved to County Kildare and made an application for basic SWA in Leixlip. She did not apply for rent supplement.</P>
      <P>The accommodation in question is a five bedroom house comprising three double rooms and two single rooms. The community welfare officer refused the application on the grounds that the accommodation was not suitable for an additional adult given the circumstances of the people already residing in the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned in my earlier response it is open to the individual in question to find alternative suitable accommodation or to appeal the CWO's decision to the health board appeals officer. If the matter is not resolved at this level <Col N="471" /> the applicant can ask the health board to refer the matter to the independent appeals officers in my Department.</P>

      <P>The back to education allowance is a second chance educational opportunities programme designed to encourage and facilitate certain groups who are receiving social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force. To qualify for participation an applicant must, <i>inter alia</i>, be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for at least six months, 156 days, immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study. The focus of the back to education allowance scheme has always been on those who have been out of employment for some time and is a recognition of the special difficulties which such persons can <Col N="472" /> face when attempting to equip themselves for the modern labour force.</P>
      <P>The minimum qualifying period has been progressively reduced since the scheme was first introduced in 1990 when it was 15 months, 390 days. It is intended to commence an independent comprehensive evaluation of the scheme later this year. This will cover all aspects of the current scheme, including the qualifying requirements and will form the basis for any future changes in the scheme.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of this reply, non-established civil servants are taken to refer to advisers, personal assistants and personal </P>
      <P>secretaries attached to my ministerial office.</P>
      <P>In my office there are three non-established civil servants employed, Mr. Mel Cousins, special adviser, Ms Myra Wall, personal secretary and Ms Chris Maguire, personal assistant. The annual salary for the special adviser of £54,215 is the maximum point of the principal, higher, scale. My personal secretary is paid on the executive officer, higher, scale and is currently on the maximum point which is £25,820. My personal assistant is currently paid £25,978 per annum which is the fourth point of the higher executive officer, standard, scale.</P>
      <P>I did not appoint a programme manager, unlike my predecessors in the rainbow coalition, which means a cost saving to the Exchequer in respect of a salary of about £46,000 per annum, quite apart from the attendant ancillary costs. Nor is there a five person policy unit in existence, something which was present prior to my coming into office and which was there to service my predecessor, at a salary cost saving of about £95,000, quite apart from the attendant ancillary costs.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions of employment of these three staff are as laid down by the Department of Finance and are in accordance with the usual conditions relating to temporary, unestablished appointments. All three appointments will terminate not later than the date on which I cease to hold office.

      <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that I am involved in a voluntary capacity with a number of organisations in my local area. This commitment predates my involvement in politics. That being so, I have contributed in excess of a day's annual leave not only this year, the International Year of the Volunteer, but over the last number of years. I propose to continue working in such a capacity for some time to come.</P>
      <P>As regards the staff of my Department, there is no special provision for the granting of paid leave to civil servants for voluntary work. There are, however, long standing special arrangements in the Civil Service whereby staff members can be considered for leave of absence for extended periods to undertake charitable work on a voluntary basis and a number of staff members of my Department have availed of these arrangements. My Department will continue to support staff members as regards leave of absence for agreed periods to undertake charitable voluntary work within the general arrangements which apply to civil servants. I hope the Deputy can appreciate that the proposal to grant one day's paid leave to some 4,500 staff members of my Department to do voluntary work is not practicable. Nonetheless, in the context of International Year of the Volunteer, I will ask my Department to keep under review proposals to encourage staff in volunteering their time to worthy causes.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the United Nations has designated the year 2001 as International Year of the Volunteer. The main objectives of the year are the recognition, promotion, facilitation and networking of volunteering contributions world-wide. The International Year of the Volunteer provides an opportunity to further raise the profile of volunteering in Ireland and progress the Government's policies with regard to development of social capital and encouragement of volunteerism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 5 December 2000, I launched the National Committee on Volunteering, under the chairmanship of Deputy Flood. This committee has a total membership of 38 and members are drawn from relevant Departments, including my Department, universities with related research or training <Col N="474" /> roles, business and industry, foundations, leading non-governmental organisations and community and voluntary groups together with some individuals in their personal capacity. This committee's primary function is to agree a broad strategy for IYV 2001. I have also asked the committee to examine and make recommendations on the possibilities for recognition and accreditation for voluntary work and for training undertaken as a volunteer; measures to widen the pool of volunteers and the range of supports needed to promote, sustain and develop volunteering. A budget of £1 million has been allocated by my Department to the workings of the National Committee on Volunteering. In addition, I have asked staff of my Department to organise a seminar on the topic, &ldquo;The Importance of Social Capital&rdquo;. This seminar will be held at the end of March and will involve prominent international and Irish speakers and will be a further contribution by my Department to the IYV 2001.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 954 of 30 January 2001.</P>
      <P>Having received detailed reports on the meeting from conservation ranger staff who were in attendance at Abbeyfeale, there is no evidence that breaches occurred of licences issued under the Wildlife Act, 1976, other than that the hares were held over until 12 January on veterinary advice. I do not consider this decision requires any action on my part.</P>
      <P>I understand that the meeting was abandoned following coursing on the first day after it was found that some hares run but not coursed were in poor condition. All hares were then held over and not released until a decision was made by a veterinary officer of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development indicating the hares were fit to be released. The matter has been raised with the Irish Coursing Club and a report requested. This report will be considered at a meeting between my officials and the Irish Coursing Club in relation to the 2000/2001 coursing season and I will then review the matter.</P>

      <P>The International Year of the Volunteer affords me another opportunity to congratulate and pay tribute to the many volunteers who have done sterling work, not just in the area of arts, culture, heritage and the Irish language but also in all walks of life. As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has been to the fore in recognising the efforts of voluntary organisations and every effort will be made to facilitate any staff members who wish to take annual leave or special leave for carrying out voluntary work. From a personal perspective, I will be making arrangements to mark the international year in an appropriate way.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that there were four seizures containing cocaine base, crack, with a combined weight of 72.6 grammes, during 2000. All these seizures occurred in the Dublin metropolitan region, three in the north central division and one in the south central division. The Garda has also informed me that there have been no seizures of cocaine base this year to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="477" /> The Garda authorities have assured me that there is no evidence of a growing presence of crack cocaine on the streets of Dublin and that they continuously monitor and analyse the trends and patterns in illicit drug use based upon seizure data. They are well aware from foreign experience of the addictive and behaviour changing nature of crack cocaine and, in this context, the incidence of cocaine base usage will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, informs me that the treatment of those addicted to cocaine is primarily through counselling. The three area health boards of the Eastern Regional Health Authority have increased their counselling and outreach services in the last number of years. Individuals who are abusing cocaine and who present for treatment can attend any of the addiction centres where they will receive an emergency assessment and the most appropriate response would be determined for each particular individual. This response invariably involves linking in with a counsellor to examine the issues around cocaine use and may also involve the provision of support to family members.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children has assured me that the drug services continue to monitor the emergence of new substances abuse, both through informal contact with drug users, formal links between outreach workers and user groups and also through examining statistical data which is collected on an ongoing basis by the national drug treatment reporting system.</P>

      <P>It is important that we continue to develop an immigration policy which meets the needs of Irish society and of the economy and which is fair, just and humane. The Deputy will be aware that the Government's legislative programme includes the immigration and residence Bill which will replace the Aliens Act, 1935. The heads of this Bill are in the course of being developed in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To assist in the preparation of this legislation and in the development of immigration policy generally, I am working on a framework which will include wide consultation within the public service, with the social partners and with the public generally. This will allow the views of all those interested in this important area of policy to have an input into the process of policy development. I am also considering a study of international <Col N="478" /> legislation and practice in the field of immigration which will enable us to learn from those countries with long experience of immigration. This will help ensure that the proposed new system will comply with best standards internationally.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am undertaking an internal review of practices within the immigration and citizenship division of my Department with a view to improving service to the public. This will also look at how interactions with other Departments and public bodies dealing with immigration issues can be improved.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this proposed framework will provide the wide consultation and the input of experience which is necessary to ensure that our immigration system is developed in a way that is appropriate to the needs of society and which provides a quality service to customers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157, 177, 178 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>In so far as the asylum process is concerned, the arrangements for unaccompanied minor asylum seekers in Ireland are governed by the provisions of section 8(5) of the Refugee Act, 1996. Section 8(5)(f2&gt;a) of the Act provides that &ldquo;where it appears to an immigration officer or an authorised officer that a child under the age of 18 years, who has either arrived at the frontiers of the State or has entered the State, is not in the custody of any person, the officer shall, as soon as practicable, so inform the health board in whose functional area the child is and thereupon the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, shall apply in relation to the child&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8(5)(f2&gt;b) provides that &ldquo;where it appears to the health board concerned, on the basis of information available to it, that an application for a declaration should be made by or on behalf of a child referred to in paragraph (f2&gt;a), the health board shall arrange for the appointment of an <Col N="479" /> officer of the health board or such other person as it may determine to make an application on behalf of the child&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the health board decides that an application for a declaration as a refugee should be made on behalf of an unaccompanied minor, the application will be dealt with as a matter of priority by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. The processing of applications for refugee status from unaccompanied minors has a number of child specific features and has regard to the UNHCR's guidelines on policies and procedures in dealing with unaccompanied children seeking asylum as well as the relevant paragraphs of the UNHCR's procedures handbook and the EU Council resolution on unaccompanied minors who are nationals of third countries, 26 June 1997. Unaccompanied minors are only interviewed in the presence of a health board representative &ndash; the question of appointment of such representatives is a matter for the health board.</P>
    <P>Co-ordinated guidelines for dealing with unaccompanied minors asylum seekers are currently being developed in my Department in consultation with the Department of Health and Children, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and representatives of the health boards. Under the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, the agencies with primary responsibility for unaccompanied minor asylum seekers are the health boards. The provision of specific services, such as health, education, social and community welfare services, are matters for the appropriate Departments and statutory agencies, in consultation with the health boards, and would be the responsibility of the individual Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of unaccompanied minors who applied for asylum in 1998, 1999 and during each month of 2000, the information made available to me by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner is set out in the following tabular statement:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>The procedures referred to by the Deputy are set out in the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended. In relation to procedure, I am informed by the Garda authorities that section 13 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, places an obligation on a person arrested to provide two specimens of his-her breath and-or a sample of blood or urine at a Garda station. Section 15 provides for the provision of such a sample at a hospital.</P>
      <P>The procedure regarding taking of a specimens of blood and urine are contained in section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 &ndash; No. 7 of 1994. Subsection (1) of section 18 of the 1994 Act states that where a designated doctor has taken a specimen of blood from a person or has been provided by the person with a specimen of his urine, the doctor shall divide the specimen into two parts , place each part in a container and he shall forthwith seal and complete the form prescribed for the purpose of this section.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides that where a specimen of blood or urine of a person has been divided into two parts pursuant to subsection 1, a member of the Garda Síochána shall offer to the person one of the sealed containers together with a statement in writing indicating that he may retain either of the containers.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) provides that when subsection 2 has been complied with a member of An Garda Síochána shall cause to be forwarded to the Medical Bureau of Road Safety for testing, the completed form plus the relevant sealed container or where the person has declined to retain one of the sealed containers, both relevant sealed containers.</P>
      <P>In relation to tests for suspected drug driving cases the sample is forwarded through the Medical Bureau for Road Safety to the State Laboratory at Abbotstown for testing. In relation to facilities in Garda stations for processing suspected drink driving cases, I am informed by the Garda authorities that suspects are only processed in Garda stations where there are rooms set aside for the doctor or in cases where the suspects breath is tested the suspect is processed in a station where there is evidential breath testing equipment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that most cases of driving under the influence of an intoxicant are dealt with by way of District Court summons as opposed to proceeding by way of a charge sheet and charge before the District Court.</P>
      <P>I am further informed by the Garda authorities that details in relation to Garda prosecutions and convictions under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961, as amended, including prosecutions for driving under the influence of an intoxicant, which includes alcohol or drugs or both are contained in the Garda Commissioner's annual crime reports, 1990 to 1999, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Statistics in relation to the years 2000 and 2001 to date have not yet been published.</P>
      <P>Details in relation to the number of prosecutions and convictions for driving under the influence of a drug(s) are not readily available and could only be ascertained by the use of a considerable amount of Garda time and resources as they are included in the &lsquo;driving under the influence of an intoxicant' category.</P>

      <P>The Refugee Act, 1996, as amended by the Immigration Act, 1999, and the Illegal Immigrants Trafficking Act, 2000, was commenced in full on 20 November 2000. Under the Act, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications/appeals for refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister on whether such status should be granted.</P>
      <P>These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which will consider applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which will consider applications for a declaration at appeal stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 to 175, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Applications for refugee status are governed by the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, which was commenced in full by me on 20 November 2000. Section 8(1) of that Act provides for the making of an application for a declaration that a person is a refugee to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are where the applicant arrives at the frontiers of the State, section 8(1)(<i>a</i>), or where the applicant is in the State whether lawfully or unlawfully, section 8(1)(<i>c</i>). Section 9(1) of the Act requires that an applicant who has applied at the frontiers of the State be given leave to enter the State, and section 9(2) gives an asylum applicant an entitlement to remain in the State until the application has been dealt with.</P>
      <P>There are no provisions in the Refugee Act which would give the Act extra-territorial effect, nor is there any entitlement under the Act for a person to apply for asylum other than in the circumstances I have outlined. Consequently the question of instructing Irish immigration officers to accept asylum application in circumstances other than those which I have outlined does not and cannot arise.</P>
      <P>Whether a carrier decides to accept a person as a passenger on board a ship or an aircraft is a matter between the carrier and the person concerned; this is the case whether or not the intending passenger tells the carrier the purpose of the journey. I have no power to direct a carrier operating outside the jurisdiction of the State to accept or refuse a person as a passenger, irrespective of any purpose which may be expressed by that person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to speculate, as I did in my response to Parliamentary Question Nos. 1044-49 on 30 January 2001, that some of those whom the ferry company declined to accept as passengers may have planned to claim asylum, some may have planned to take up employment illegally and others may have intended to use this country as a transit point for the United Kingdom. I remind the Deputy that any such person who wished to seek asylum would be in a position to make the necessary application to the French authorities or to the authorities in the EU state through which he or she first entered the territory of the European Union. This approach <Col N="489" /> is reflected in the principles underpinning the Dublin Convention to which all EU states are parties.</P>

      <P>I can confirm, as indicated in the Government legislative programme announced by the Chief Whip on 25 January 2001, that the immigration (carriers' liability) Bill is in course of preparation in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government on foot of a scheme developed in my Department. The legislation will make it an offence for a passenger carrier to bring improperly documented passengers to the State. Among the matters being considered in the context of that work is how the Bill should apply in relation to improperly documented passengers who on arrival seek asylum.</P>

      <P>The execution of a deportation order is an operational matter for the Garda national immigration bureau. I understand that in any case where a person in Garda custody, including a person arrested on foot of a deportation order, requires medical attention, the gardaí will ensure that such person receives medical attention immediately. While my Department understands from UNHCR that they do not have specific guidelines in this direction I assure the Deputy that the Garda national immigration bureau will not deport any person where there is medical advice that such person is unfit to travel.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, last year the Government agreed the allocation of major additional resources including the recruitment of 370 additional staff aimed at the speeding up of processing times in respect of asylum applications, including appeals, and to deal with the consequential increase in the level of repatriations of people whose applications for refugee status are unsuccessful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional resources, including staff, being allocated to the Department are being utilised to achieve a number of strategic objectives, namely, greatly increasing processing capacity, including appeals, to deliver more speedy decisions in relation to applications for refugee status leading, in due course, to the completion to finality of the processing of all new asylum applications within a six month period &ndash; which will ensure that those who are genuine refugees will receive decisions on their applications much more speedily and that non-genuine applications will also be dealt with on a faster basis, the elimination of the asylum applications currently on hands as soon as possible and dealing with the increased numbers of repatriations which are expected to arise in <Col N="491" /> respect of persons whose applications for refugee status are refused.</P>
    <P>While a significant number of the additional staff are now in place and have either undergone or are receiving the necessary training at present, the remainder are being recruited, in the main, by a special competition organised by my Department which is being advertised at the present time.</P>
    <P>In relation to the processing of asylum applications, the specific objective is to achieve significantly accelerated processing times with a view to having a first instance processing capacity of 1,400 per month and an appeals processing capacity of 1,000 appeals per month. The achievement of these objectives is dependent on a number of factors including applications remaining at present levels, the additional staff being fully in place and trained and additional accommodation being acquired. Once this is achieved a realistic assessment of time scales in relation to the objective of reducing processing time for asylum applications to six months will be feasible.</P>
    <P>Under the Refugee Act, 1996, responsibility for processing asylum applications at first instance lies with the Refugee Applications Commissioner and with the Refugee Appeals Tribunal for appeals.</P>

      <P>Section 12 (4) of the Refugee Act, 1996, which contains the grounds upon which an application for a declaration as a refugee can be deemed to be manifestly unfounded, does not provide for an application to be deemed manifestly unfounded on the basis of prior transit through another European Union state. The Dublin Convention is, in fact, the appropriate mechanism for determining which Dublin Convention state is responsible for examining an application for asylum.</P>

      <Quest>the places at which Irish immigration officials, whether gardaí or otherwise, are stationed outside the State for the purpose of controlling immigration; if, in each case, this is done on the basis of formal or informal agreements with the host country; and if it is intended to station bureau members in other extra-territorial embarkation points in the future.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 184 to 186, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of discussions relating to the conclusion of a re-admission agreement with the Government of Romania, it was decided that two Romanian officials, one from the Romanian police service and one from its immigration service, would be seconded to Dublin to work with our immigration authorities. The officials in question arrived in Ireland on 3 September 2000. The primary function of the Romanian officials was to establish effective liaison arrangements between both jurisdictions, with particular regard to trafficking in human beings. The officers in question left the State on 3 December 2000 but the contacts established are being maintained. In the context of that ongoing co-operation, it is intended that further assignments of Romanian officials will be considered as the need arises hav<Col N="493" /> ing regard to operational requirements at the time in question.</P>
    <P>At present it is not the intention to enter into similar arrangements with other non-EEA states but the possibility of doing so will also be kept under ongoing review, again having regard to any operational requirements that may arise in the future.</P>
    <P>In so far as the assignment of Irish officials abroad is concerned the position is that the Government, as part of a number of measures agreed in relation to asylum, refugee and immigration matters, approved the strengthening of Garda international liaison arrangements through the placing of Garda liaison officers in the Irish embassies in London and Paris. The officers, who will very shortly take up their assignments, will interact with local law enforcement authorities on immigration matters generally but with particular reference to the combating of trafficking activity. A formal agreement was not necessary in the case of either assignment.</P>
    <P>The role of the officers in question is solely a liaison one and does not involve their participation in the direct operation of immigration controls outside the jurisdiction. It is not proposed to appoint officers to operate immigration controls outside the jurisdiction, although members of the Garda national immigration bureau will continue, where appropriate, to provide informal advice to carriers who request assistance, including in connection with the application of document checks at points of embarkation outside the State.</P>
    <P>Question No. 187 answered with Question No. 157.</P>

The conditions are that the applicant is of full age, is of good character, has had a period of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years, intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation, and has made, either before a Justice of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy may contact the telephone helpline in the citizenship division of my Department, telephone No. 01-6028202, on either a Tuesday or a Thursday morning between 10 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. My officials will send him an application form for naturalisation together with an explanatory leaflet detailing the required supporting documentation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the International Year of the Volunteer initiative. Much of the work of my Department in the areas of sport and recreation, local development and the national drugs strategy relies heavily on volunteerism. I express my grateful appreciation, and that of my colleague Minister of State at my Department, <Col N="499" /> Deputy Eoin Ryan, for the unstinting efforts of the many who give freely of their time for the benefit of others.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provided for the establishment of the national committee on volunteering with the long-term aim of devising strategies and actions for supporting volunteering. This committee, which was established under the chairmanship of Deputy Chris Flood, will oversee the management of the International Year of the Volunteer in Ireland and also contribute to this work at an international level. It will also examine and make recommendations on recognition for voluntary work and training and the range of supports needed to promote, sustain and develop volunteering in Ireland. I am happy to say that the Irish Sports Council is represented on the committee.</P>
      <P>I make myself available to every extent possible to support and promote the work of the community and voluntary sector and I will continue to do so. Staff members of my Department requesting a day's annual leave to carry out volunteer work in recognition of the International Year of the Volunteer will be facilitated where possible.</P>
      <P>There are long-standing special arrangements in the Civil Service whereby staff members can be considered for leave of absence for extended periods in order to undertake charitable work on a voluntary basis. My Department will continue to operate these arrangements in a flexible manner consistent with the achievement of its strategic aims and objectives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 195 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>Students studying at postgraduate level may apply for financial assistance under the terms of the higher education grants scheme or, if appropriate, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme. For 2000-01 the non-adjacent and adjacent rates of maintenance grant are £1,775 and £710 respectively. A postgraduate grantholder is also eligible to have his or her fees paid up to a maximum amount of £3,064.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the level of maintenance grants, I have followed the practice of recent years and increased grant rates in line with increases in <Col N="500" /> inflation. I have also increased the reckonable income limits, for purposes of the student support schemes, in line with increases in the average industrial wage.</P>
    <P>Late last year I announced that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>
    <P>Last October, I amended the student support schemes to provide financial assistance for eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained. This amendment is operative from the current academic year 2000-01.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Finance Act, 2000, provided for the introduction of tax relief for postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This new relief, which is available for the tax year 2000-01 onwards, will apply at the standard rate of tax and will be available to full-time and part-time postgraduate students. Further details and conditions in relation to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>
    <P>Increasing the number of people with higher degrees is an important national strategic objective. Apart from the general strategic objective of ensuring a vibrant pool of high quality postgraduates, the success of the substantial investment in our research capability is dependent on an adequate supply of high quality graduates.</P>
    <P>In this regard, Government of Ireland research scholarships are awarded by the Irish Research Council for the Humanities and Social Sciences. More than 200 postgraduate scholarships have been awarded by the council since its establishment in 1998, including 93 awards for the academic year 2000-01. These awards attract a maintenance allowance of £8,000 per annum for a maximum of three years.</P>
    <P>I have recently announced the establishment of the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology. The new council will put in place, within these fields of study, similar postgraduate scholarship arrangements to those applying in the humanities and social science areas.</P>
    <P>Under the programme for research in third level institutions, which is co-funded under the European Regional Development Fund, third level institutions compete for funding for institutional research programmes. These pro<Col N="501" /> grammes can include the awarding by the colleges of postgraduate scholarships. A total of 236 such awards have been made since the launch of the first cycle of the programme in 1999. The <i>per capita</i> amount awarded for scholarships varies according to institution and field of study.</P>
    <P>A total of 49 postgraduate scholarships were awarded in 2000 under the postgraduate research and development skills development initiative in the technological sector. These scholarships are valued at some £7,000 annually.</P>

      <P>The Department of Education and Science does not differentiate between national and non-national children, whether they are refugees, asylum seekers or other non-nationals, attending primary or post-primary schools. All non-national pupils are included in the total enrolment of a school for the purpose of capitation grants, free books and other grants on the same basis as Irish pupils.</P>
      <P>Additional support is made available to primary and post-primary schools catering for non-national pupils who have significant English language deficits. Schools with 14 or more such non-national pupils are granted an additional temporary teaching post for up to two school years. Primary schools where three to 13 such non-national pupils are enrolled may apply to my Department for grant assistance towards the provision of teaching resources for the pupils.</P>
      <P>At second level where the number of such non-national pupils enrolled is between one and six, the school may be provided with an additional teaching allocation of two hours per week for each pupil up to a maximum of ten hours per week. The allocation for non-national pupils over six in number would generally be based on one and half hours per week for each pupil.</P>
      <P>Schools eligible for an additional teacher under these provisions will receive a start-up grant of £500 with a top-up grant of £250 in each successive year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Education and Sci<Col N="502" /> ence funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students, which are administered by the local authorities and vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality. Students who are repeating a year at the same level are generally not eligible.</P>
      <P>My Department meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.</P>
      <P>However, since 1994 the higher education grants scheme and vocational education committees scholarship scheme have included a concession for &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students returning to college after a break of at least five years having previously pursued, but not completed, a third level course. This concession allows such students to be funded again for periods of study at the same level. Prior to 1994, a student did not receive financial assistance until they had completed the equivalent amount of time spent on their original course, irrespective of the length of time, which had elapsed between the two periods of college attendance. There are similar arrangements applying for &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students under the free fees initiative.</P>
      <P>As part of a funding initiative at third level, the higher non-adjacent rate of grant is now being paid to all eligible mature students under the student support schemes with effect from the 1999-2000 academic year.</P>
      <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. The fund is administered by the third level institutions and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain on in college to complete their studies.</P>
      <P>I announced late last year that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a comprehensive review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of present day third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. I will consider the appropriate response when I receive the team's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 2000, when setting up the action group on access to third level education, I <Col N="503" /> announced, as an initial step pending the finding of the group, the introduction of special rates of maintenance grant payable to disadvantaged grant holders. The adjacent and non-adjacent rates announced were £1,000 and £2,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive the report of the action group shortly and recommendations relating to the criteria for the special rates of grant are part of that report. A further announcement regarding the special rates of grant will issue when I have fully considered the recommendations presented in the report.</P>
    <P>The vocational training opportunity scheme and the back to education allowance schemes operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs enable adults over 21 who are at least six months unemployed to return to full-time education while retaining a welfare payment or training allowance. The White Paper on adult education, &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo;, also proposes arrangements under which part time adult education opportunities will be expanded, and fee relief given for those who are unemployed, medical card holders, means-tested welfare recipients, or family income supplement recipients or their dependants.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the issue to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that all outstanding payments in respect of the case in ques<Col N="504" /> tion have now been made to the school authorities.</P>
    <P>I understand that the regrettable delay in issuing payment which arose in this case was due to the large volume of payments for special needs assistant services being processed by my Department's special education section during the period in question. The growth in the volume of activity in this area is reflected in the fact that the number of special needs assistants in the primary system has increased from less than 300 at the end of 1998 to close to 1,700 at present.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently in the process of reviewing its procedures for processing payments in respect of special needs assistants with a view to ensuring that delays of the type referred to by the Deputy are avoided in the future.</P>

      <P>Section 7 of the Education Act, 1998 provides that it is a function of the Minister to &ldquo;ensure, subject to the provisions of this Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State . support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My Department does not differentiate between national and non-national children, whether they are refugees, asylum seekers or other non-nationals, attending primary or post-primary schools. All non-national pupils are included in the total enrolment of a school for the purpose of capitation grants, free books and other grants on the same basis as Irish pupils.</P>
      <P>Additional support is made available to primary and post-primary schools catering for non-national pupils who have significant English language deficits. Schools with 14 or more non-national pupils with significant English language deficits are granted an additional temporary teaching post for up to two school years; primary schools where three to 13 non-national pupils are enrolled may apply to my Department for grant assistance towards the provision of teaching resources for the pupils.</P>
      <P>At second level where the number of such non-national pupils enrolled is between one and six, the school may be provided with an additional teaching allocation of two hours per week for each pupil up to a maximum of ten hours per week. The allocation for non-national pupils over six in number would generally be based on one and a half hours per week for each pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Schools eligible for an additional teacher under <Col N="505" /> these provisions will receive a start up-grant of £500 with a top-up grant of £250 in each successive year.</P>

      <P>The design team appointed for the project at the school in question submitted detailed documentation and plans to my Department for the proposed refurbishment works and these are being examined.</P>
      <P>The rate of progress to construction depends on factors such as the complexity and size of the project, the time required to undertake architectural planning, the volume of other projects being dealt with by the design team and my Department's building unit, the period of time required for the granting of planning permission and obtaining a fire certificate, the outcome of the tender competition and the procurement, where relevant, of bonds, insurance and tax clearance by prospective contractors.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it is not possible to say at this point when construction will commence. However, the school authorities will be kept informed of developments.</P>

Much good work has been done over the years by voluntary workers in all walks of life, including the area of education, and this year will be seen as recognition for their endeavours.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness a national committee on volunteering has been established with the long-term aim of devising strategies and actions for supporting volunteering. I can assure the Deputy that any strategies which the committee may propose in the area of education will be given every consideration by my Department.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of circular 2/76, civil servants may avail of special leave without pay for a number of purposes, including service with voluntary organisations engaged in community welfare, charitable and other voluntary initiatives. I am prepared to facilitate any officials from my Department who may wish to participate in voluntary activities under the terms of this circular.</P>
      <P>For my own part, I am involved with voluntary organisations, both local and national, outside of my normal working hours that take up substantially more than one day of my personal time each year.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees criteria, tuition fees will be paid in respect of EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to a third level course subject to certain conditions. This condition applies equally to all EU nationals, including Irish nationals, in accordance with the judgment of the European Court of Justice that access to vocational training must apply equally to all EU nationals. I understand <Col N="508" /> that similar residency requirements operate in the other EU member states.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for a maintenance grant under the terms of the student support schemes, a candidate must fulfil conditions as to residence, age, academic attainments, means and nationality. To fulfil the residency requirement a candidate's parents, or, in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate her or himself, shall have been resident in the administrative area of the local authority from 1 October of the year prior to entry on an approved course. The local authority has discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>Candidates who are EU nationals and who do not satisfy the residency requirements under the free fees initiative are eligible to apply for a means tested fees only grant in respect of approved courses in the Republic of Ireland, provided they have been ordinarily resident, for a purpose other than wholly or mainly to receive full-time education, in an EU member state from 1 October of the year prior to entry to college.</P>
