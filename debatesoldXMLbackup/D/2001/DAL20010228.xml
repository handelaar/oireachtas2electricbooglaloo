      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of related notices under Standing Order 31 from Deputies Naughten and J. Higgins. I propose to call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent national importance. Following the statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to the House yesterday that Irish Rail had furnished him with inaccurate information and given that the inquiry and retraining structures of Irish Rail following such rail incidents is totally inadequate, there is an urgent need for a review of rail safety procedures and to ensure that the rail safety inspector has the statutory authority to review such procedures and initiate investigations into rail incidents.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>
        <b>:</b> I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following matter requiring urgent consideration, namely, the misinformation supplied to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, by Iarnród Éireann regarding a train incident at Kiltoom, County Roscommon, on 22 December 2000, which led to the Minister of State inadvertently misleading the Dáil last week and his subsequent statement and retraction in the Dáil yesterday evening and the serious consequences for public safety and the integrity of the Dáil of such misleading information.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 19, Motion re Referral to <Col N="902" /> Select Committee of proposed approval of Agreement on Scientific and Technological Co-operation between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of Ireland; No. 20, Motion re International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation, 1990 (returned from Committee); No. 21, Motion re Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 (returned from Committee); No. 22, Motion re Irish Takeover Panel Act, 1997 (Relevant Company) Regulations, 2001 (returned from Committee); and No. 6, Finance Bill, 2001 &ndash; Second Stage (resumed).</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30p.m. tonight and Business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m.; (2) Nos. 19, 20, 21 and 22 shall be decided without debate; and (3) the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 6 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m. tonight. Private Members' Business shall be No. 111 &ndash; Motion re Health Services (resumed) &ndash; to conclude at 8.30p.m.</P>

      <P>There are three proposals to put to the House. Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir. On a number of occasions I have raised a matter on the Order of Business at this juncture. I have repeatedly asked the Taoiseach when he will explain to the House why a former Minister of State was bullied by an unelected person into resignation, why this Minister's version of events is at odds with his and why the Minister in question had responsibility for an area which is of crisis proportions. The Taoiseach has a responsibility to address the House, to be accountable to it and to explain why these events took place and his role in them. I will continue to ask the Taoiseach to be accountable to the House.</P>
      <P>There will be three votes today and many votes tomorrow. We could be here for a long time until such time as the Taoiseach faces up to his responsibilities and tells the House and the nation why Deputy O'Keeffe was sacked or forced to resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the Order of Business on similar but more extended grounds. First, there is Deputy O'Keeffe's unexplained resignation/sacking and the part played by some shadowy advisers in that affair. Second, as a result of Deputy O'Keeffe's resignation the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cúiv, was given new responsibilities and he has said that he has neither a budget nor a function in his new role. He seems to have no interest in the post he has been given. Third, the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, made a statement in the House yesterday. He had been grossly misled by CIÉ and was turned into a fig<Col N="903" /> ure of fun which would have matched the heyday of &ldquo;Scrap Saturday&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not casting aspersions on the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, but he was so grossly misled that only the Taoiseach can explain how a Minister of State could, in effect, have been set up by people in CIÉ when such a serious matter as a rail accident was involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach needs to take all these issues together in the House. A third Minister of State <Col N="904" /> is in the firing line this morning. Rather than letting it go on from day to day and having us call votes on the Order of Business every morning, the Taoiseach should come out of his bunker and deal with the issues in the manner in which his predecessor dealt with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Item No. 19, a motion regarding referral of an agreement on scientific and technological co-operation between this country and the People's Republic of China requires debate because the practice is growing in this Government to do sweetheart deals with technological interests, including MediaLab. The normal tendering process does not seem to be adhered to. In relation to this arrangement with the People's Republic of China, it should be clearly stated that tendering is part and parcel of technological investment in this country. I am not sure what the Chinese Government does but I have a feeling it is not as democratic as we would wish.</P>

      <P>Prior to the vote, I asked the Taoiseach when would he announce if he would make time available for himself to explain to the House the events surrounding the enforced resignation of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe. Before we proceed with this matter, will he give an indication whether he will be accountable to this House and have the courage to stand up and explain why, as Taoiseach, he did certain things? That is the Taoiseach's job. He may not like it but he is accountable to this House. It is the job of the Opposition to make the Taoiseach of the day accountable. It will be his job when in Opposition following the next election to do the same.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach and everybody else in the House is aware that the issues of food safety and animal health are paramount in this country at present yet we have witnessed the unexplained resignation of the Minister of State who was responsible for food safety. Several precedents exist for Taoisigh and Cabinet Ministers to come into the House to make statements and answer questions from the Opposition. Why is the Taoiseach so afraid to follow precedent in this regard? Has he something to hide? Is he prepared to be forthright and arrange to come into the House next week to deal with this matter?</P>

      <P>When did the Taoiseach last hold a detailed discussion with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development or the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, in regard to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK? It appears to me we have evidence that the assurances provided by both Ministers to this House have not been upheld. For example, two young women returning to Ireland from a UK agricultural college which was closed due to the outbreak, travelled by bus through Dún Laoghaire port. The bus tyres were disinfected and one of the young women, who comes from County Limerick, approached the person in charge and sought advice on the regulations with which she should comply. Details of her name and address were taken but nothing else happened. The woman was allowed to return to the family farm in Limerick. This incident, which happened only yesterday, totally contravenes the assurances provided in this House by the Minister and Minister of State. It appears that practice is not keeping pace with theory and that the Government is making an appalling mess of this potential catastrophe.</P>

Irrespective of what the Taoiseach feels is his duty, we would be failing in ours if we did not highlight incidents such as the one to which Deputy Noonan referred and another which occurred last night in Dublin Port where people travelling to this country from Liverpool were not disinfected at all. Will the Taoiseach put in place help lines, hot lines and other forms of assistance to allow people to be informed about this issue? This is not an issue on which the House is divided but it is an issue which will destroy the country if the Government does not get its act together.</P>

      <P>The effort to keep foot and mouth disease out of this country is a national issue of paramount importance. For it to be otherwise would be hugely detrimental to all sec<Col N="912" /> tors of the economy and would cause enduring widescale damage to the agri-food sector in particular, probably for years to come. The effort to keep foot and mouth out of Ireland requires the ongoing commitment of the entire population here. There have been a number of incidents which give rise to concern, one of which was highlighted on the &ldquo;Marian Finucane Show&rdquo; this morning and relayed by Deputy Noonan in the House.</P>
      <P>I attended the first meeting of the task force this morning. The task force comprises Ministers, members of the gardaí and the Army, customs officers, representatives of the Department of Public Enterprise, Aer Rianta and others. We decided the other day that all ports and airports would be vigilantly manned. Deputy Dukes stated that this issue should be in people's faces and I agree with him. I have asked the airports and ports to display clear signs which people will see immediately on disembarking. It should be made clear that disinfectant bays are available. If possible, I have asked the port and airport authorities to ensure all passengers go through the disinfectant bays. That would be the best way to proceed although I am not certain it is entirely feasible. I am aware that people would not necessarily be wearing the same clothing they wore on farms or other land. Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Farranfore, Shannon, Galway, Knock, Sligo and Donegal airports and Dún Laoghaire, Dublin and Rosslare ports will all display &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; signs warning people about the disease and indicating the existence of disinfectant bays. There is also a mobile presence in Ringaskiddy in Cork and in Kinsale and Crosshaven marinas.</P>
      <P>A number of other measures were discussed and agreed this morning following yesterday's debate in the House. The wording of front page newspaper advertising will be strengthened and tightened and local radio, local newspapers and any other available media will be used to provide information. Where people must go abroad, they can at least ensure they do their utmost to prevent the spread of the disease. It is our duty to ensure facilities are provided to facilitate this. Whatever resources &ndash; financial, manpower or otherwise &ndash; are required to do this job properly will be provided. Several hundred people are being employed to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>It was stated yesterday that the disease only affects cloven hoofed animals, of which there are a number on Fota Island and in Dublin Zoo, although we tend to think only of cattle, pigs, goats, sheep etc. The Government this morning requested the Office of Public Works to close Fota Wildlife Park and Dublin Zoo. The Office of Public Works is also suspending all arterial work.</P>
      <P>The question of the movement of cattle was also raised. I am advised that while the movement of cattle to final destination points such as factories is acceptable, farm to farm movement is a serious issue.</P>

      <P>A meeting is currently ongoing on this matter and we will announce its outcome as soon as possible. In reply to Deputy Noonan, what happened yesterday is not acceptable, but I accept it at face value. Other incidents have been reported to my office this morning. Over the weekend and again today more formally I instructed that whatever is necessary must be done. The Garda, and the Army have secured the 30 official Border crossings but today we must ensure that all other crossings are secured. It is not practical to stop everyone coming into the country but everyone should cross the disinfected mats. Supplies of disinfectant, which are produced in Wexford, are adequate. They ran out in Britain and we do not want that happening here. I will not be here tomorrow morning but we have already put in place arrangements for the Garda, the army, inspectors, veterinary officers and others to seal off particular areas if even a scare occurs. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and repeat on behalf of all the Members that this is a national effort to avoid a crisis. The leaders of agriculture stated that one case of foot and mouth disease would ruin a £5 billion industry for a considerable period. Every effort must be applied, no matter how extreme it appears.</P>

      <P>This is simply not good enough. There is now a yawning credibility gap between what Ministers announce, what is supposed to be the regulatory regime and what is happening in practice. In the case of this young woman, it was not lack of advertising that was the problem. She studies at an English agricultural college which was closed down. She knew the issues involved and approached the person in charge at the port of Dún Laoghaire and all they did was take her name and address.</P>
      <P>What instruction has the Taoiseach given to the staff at places like Dún Laoghaire when persons like this young woman approach them and ask for their advice? What is the point in announcing in planes that one must visit the agriculture official at Dublin Airport if, when one does, nothing happens? This woman knew the issues and was very conscious of them because her college had been closed down because of them. Yet, when she went to whoever is responsible at Dún Laoghaire they only took her name and address. What is the Taoiseach's understanding of what should have happened at the port of Dún Laoghaire, yesterday? </P>

      <P>Last night the Minister for Finance did a spectacular U-turn, even for him, when he abandoned the measures of the third Bacon report in respect of the provisions for first time house buyers. Was the Taoiseach aware of this? The set of measures which were abandoned last night were designed to protect first time buyers. Does this mean that the Government believes it has solved the problem for first time house buyers? Can he explain why it capitulated to the moneyed interests which, no doubt, brought pressure to bear in relation to this matter? In the light of this dramatic policy change, what new measures, if any, will be introduced for first time buyers? Can we link this decision to capitulate to the money men, to Fianna Fáil's insistence on protecting the ongoing existence of corporate donations?</P>

      <P>I support the thrust of Deputy Quinn's question and ask the Taoiseach to throw light on the other decision made, which is also contrary to the Bacon report. The capital gains tax on land was reduced to 20% so that land would come readily to the market. A condition of the 20% was that if it had not come to market within three years a rate of 60% would apply. It was a normal enough stick and carrot approach. The Minister in the Finance Bill is abolishing the 60% rate. Regardless of whether land comes to market it will be charged at 20%. If he is abandoning the capital gains imposition and the stamp duty regime, what is now the Government's policy in respect of first time buyers?</P>

      <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Finance Bill, 2001.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with some specific provisions in the Bill, in particular, those most recently announced by the Minister. He announced an interesting and elaborate savings scheme as part of an amendment to the Bill, which we have not yet seen. That is worthy of a good deal of study and comment. My first response to it is that it runs counter to <Col N="924" /> much of what the Minister said about savings in recent months. In response to a parliamentary question tabled a few months ago, he cast great doubt on the reliability of savings ratio data. He seemed to suggest that in so far as the data suggest anything they seem to suggest the savings ratio has been increasing in recent years. He did not give any indication up to the period immediately prior to the budget that he was interested in increasing the savings ratio. My conclusion from that is he is doing this in response to the European Commission or the inspiration for this measure came from elsewhere in Government. The measure is before us and we must consider it.</P>
    <P>On a micro level in terms of the customer, citizen or adult beneficiary, that savings scheme is superficially at least a pretty attractive one. It amounts year on year to a benefit of about 8%, perhaps 9%, although it is difficult to gainsay that. If I had a few bob or a few euros, I would not hesitate to put it aside.</P>
    <P>On a macro level, the message is entirely different and much more mixed. The Minister pumped a great deal of additional money into the economy last December and a few weeks later he is seeking to find some means of taking it out again. Whether he is successful in doing that, only time will tell, but it casts some doubt at least on the wisdom of the original strategy.</P>
    <P>On the level of detail, I have concerns about the operation of the scheme, which perhaps the Minister could address when responding on Second Stage or during Committee Stage. The obvious concern is that we do not know from where the money is coming. We do not know whether any moneys that will be invested in products that are part of this scheme will be new moneys that will represent new savings or whether they will be simply displacing savings already in existence. The likelihood must be that people who get 2% or 3% from money on deposit in banks will surely invest in these new products and get a greater benefit from the State. I doubt whether that will be of any long-term benefit in terms of taking money out of the economy, although it will be of some benefit to the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>There will be a difficulty if many people were to avail of this scheme. On the face of it, there is a good chance many people will take advantage of it. If 500,000 people were to use it, I reckon the year-on-year cost would be about £250 million or 325 million. Most of that will come into play when money is taken out in five or six years. Therefore, the cost to the State will be considerable given the way in which the Minister has set up the scheme. It will effectively allow people to earn a considerable amount more tax free in any given year provided they set aside the money. What effort has been made in the Department to calculate the cost of the scheme? In response to questions last week, the Minister said it would cost £100 million. However, this is based on a rela<Col N="925" /> tively low level of take up. I am interested to know how the Minister reached that estimate because it is relatively low. If the cost could be multiples of that amount, I question whether it is a good use of resources in terms of the Exchequer position. It can support such a scheme today, but we do not know if it will be able to do so in five or six years.</P>
    <P>One must have money if one is to take advantage of the scheme. If one is to benefit significantly from it, one would need to invest close to the maximum amount of £200 a month. It is likely that people who have money will open more than one account, perhaps in the name of a relative or friend. At that level, it will, in effect, amount to little more than an additional tax break for people who already have money. Those who do not have money cannot save it in the first place. In recent years, many people have taken out mortgages and borrowed to the hilt. They know that few people in that category can afford to save an extra £100 or £200 a month.</P>
    <P>There is also a concern that banks may abuse the scheme. They may either introduce charges that will claw back a significant amount of the benefit or engage in what is effectively back to back lending. They may lend up front on the strength of money that will be taken in later. This would be a significant abuse of the scheme, but I am not sure if the Minister can prevent it legislatively. It would be difficult to do so, but, undoubtedly, banks and credit institutions are considering whether they can manufacture schemes that will channel a major portion of the additional benefit to themselves rather than individual customers.</P>
    <P>Why has An Post not been given a much more significant role in the operation of the scheme, which is analogous to the post office certificates scheme with which many Members of the House are familiar? Until relatively recently, these certificates provided a good return provided one left one's money with the post office for three to five years. This money was then available to the State for day to day services, although in recent years it has moved it around. An Post should have been given a much more significant role. There should have been an encouragement for people to lodge money by way of certificates or other products that An Post, through the NTMA, might wish to develop and I regret that is not the case. I ask the Minister to explicitly confirm that An Post will participate in the scheme and will offer products to the public. He should use his offices to ensure that is the case because concern has been expressed in recent days that this will not happen.</P>
    <P>I support the principle of share options and financial participation. Employees in a place of work, such as an office, company or partnership, should be encouraged to financially participate in the running of the operation. They should be stakeholders. However, I do not support the scheme set out by the Minister. There is a need to consider the underlying principle of these schemes. I read with interest extracts from the PEPPER report, which was produced by the <Col N="926" /> European Commission some years ago. The major impetus must be to infuse a certain loyalty in workers so that they view their interests as analogous to the interests of the company for which they work. It should motivate people to greater productivity and profitability. From the employers' point of view, it also allows certain flexibility in terms of remuneration. They can allow employees to earn more when times are good or take less by way of bonuses when times are bad.</P>
    <P>The essential principle is that it should be a perk, a bonus and an incentive and not a replacement for a huge chunk of income. If employers want to pay workers more, they should do so. Income tax should be paid on foot of that and employers' PRSI should be paid on the full salary. Many corporations and companies in Ireland are much more profitable than they were up to eight years ago. The return on capital in the economy has improved considerably in recent years. In addition, the rate of corporation tax has been dramatically reduced so many employers are in a much better position to pay key workers more than in the past.</P>
    <P>Any scheme should have been available on more or less equal terms to all employees. If the Minister's scheme is a genuine move to give people a genuine stakeholding in a company, 30% should not have been set aside for key employees. However, the scheme is intended to replace the salaries of already well paid workers with an additional chunk that will attract tax at a much lower rate. It is fine if employers wish to do this, but they should not seek a tax break to allow it to happen. Undoubtedly, the scheme will be used by some employers as a means of circumventing the Minister's decision to lift the ceiling on employers' PRSI, a move I deplore.</P>
    <P>All the shares should have been available, although perhaps not on equal terms, to all the employees or at least those who have been in the company for a certain time. There should have been a limit, probably one related to salary or one expressed in simple monetary amounts. I understand this is the practice in many other countries, including the UK. If the maximum amount of share options one could attract was limited to a quarter or a third of salary, it would have been reasonable and generous in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>It would have been wise and sensible for the Minister to introduce the scheme at the same time as he dealt with the issue of gain and profit sharing generally. When push comes to shove, share options will only be available in a relatively limited number of companies. They will only be of meaning in publicly quoted companies or in private companies where there is some expectation or hope that they might be floated in the near future. Shares in private limited companies are of relatively little use. They are not valueless, but they are much less valuable than if they were tradable on the open market. Only a relatively small number of workers in a relatively small <Col N="927" /> number of companies will benefit from this measure and this is a pity. We should use this opportunity to extend stakeholding to the maximum possible number of companies and places of employment.</P>
    <P>This is also the case with regard to gain sharing, which is of particular relevance in the public service. A performance management system is just about up and running in the public service and some means must be found of linking that to performance related pay and sharing in gains that are made in terms of performance within the public service and other employments where it is not easy to devise profit sharing schemes. I support the principle of share options and stakeholding within companies, but the measure introduced by the Minister is wrong. It is intended to facilitate legal tax avoidance on high salaries for a relatively small number of people and that is something I cannot support.</P>
    <P>I dealt earlier with the Minister's changes in stamp duty and the anti-speculative tax that was due to come into play in April this year.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to labour the point or repeat what I said other than to say that I am still at a loss to understand, and deeply suspicious of, the motivation behind the Minister's move. I wish to refer to the capital gains tax change he proposes to make in the Bill. It is worth asking the following question. Why did he exempt development land when he reduced CGT in his first budget from 40% to 20%? The reason must be that even he, with his strong antipathy to just about every form of capital tax, accepted that it would not look great if he was seen to give a clear, significant and valuable reward to those who were benefiting at the community's expense. There were and are people hoarding development land in the expectation of making considerable gains, many, if not all, of which would arise from the fact that the land in question had been rezoned. Even the Minister, with his particular and obvious prejudices, accepted that it would be unacceptable for him to reduce CGT on development land from 40% to 20% in his 1997 budget, if memory serves me correctly.</P>
    <P>The first Bacon report recommended as a carrot-and-stick measure that the Minister reduce the rate of CGT on development land to 20%, but with the important proviso that it be raised again to 60% next year. The thinking was clear, it would provide for a three year period within which planning permission could be obtained and the land placed on to the market in order that it would be available for building. At the time I, among others, expressed doubt as to whether the Minister was serious.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a well known antipathy to every form of capital tax and I found it incredible that he would even suggest that he would follow through on the &ldquo;stick&rdquo; element of the proposal and increase CGT to 60%. It does not surprise me in the slightest that he has not done so. I would have been amazed if he had. What did sur<Col N="928" /> prise me a little was that he did not wait until next year. That he chose to do it this year surprised me because if the stick was to be effective in having land placed on the market, it was more likely to be so in the latter stages of the interim period provided for in the Bacon report. There was about 15 months to go before the 60% rate was due to take effect. Why the Minister did not leave it until the budget later this year to make the change is beyond me. Perhaps it has to do with factors unrelated to the Finance Bill. Perhaps there is a clearing of the decks and the Minister does not expect to be in a position to deliver another budget. If that is the case, perhaps he is of the view that a Minister of another hue, or from his own party, would not share his particular prejudices, but I find it surprising that he has chosen to remove this incentive either to sell or develop now.</P>
    <P>The Bill confirms the reduction in VAT, about which I am still sceptical largely because it affects a small range of goods &ndash; beer, motor cars, cigarettes. I am not sure it would have been a priority of mine to reduce VAT on such goods, not least because they are inelastic when it comes to prices. Has the Minister dealt with the Director of Consumer Affairs and is he satisfied that that reduction has been passed on to the consumer, either in whole or in part? That is the most important question at this stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax relief being provided for on trade union contributions, something for which my colleagues in the trade union movement have been looking for some time through the partnership process. I am pleased that the Minister has seen fit to agree to this and that in future trade union contributions will be made tax free.</P>
    <P>Under a provision introduced a couple of years ago bus passes may be provided for employees without being subject to benefit-in-kind. I am informed by Dublin Bus, however, that in practice the provision has proved difficult to operate. For example, those on fixed salaries such as civil servants find it almost impossible to avail of the scheme and employers have been unable to devise a way in which they can participate. This is a matter with which I will deal in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The PRSI system is in a mess. There is a £100 allowance, an exemption of £226 and a health levy which kicks in at the slightly higher rate of about £280. There is also a ceiling for employees. There is no longer a ceiling for employers. There is a need for a radical look at the scheme and to simplify it dramatically. The Minister would have my support in doing so. He also has my support in removing the ceiling for employers as there is a need to claw back the reduction in corporation tax in a fair and reasonable way. In most places of employment there are employees on salaries above and below the ceiling. There would be relatively few places of employment, therefore, where the employer would be at a significant disadvantage. It is an equitable and reasonable move which I am happy to support.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> I am envious of the Minister who seems to be of the view that this is his last budget. He has been in a position in the past four years to take many of the steps which undoubtedly he was looking forward to taking for some time. I compliment him on that score. On a political level, I deplore almost everything he has done and hope he will not have the opportunity to repeat the exercise. Nonetheless, he must take pride in managing the economy in good times and achieving much of what he set out to achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I am sure many Deputies will have read the remarks in a recent newspaper article about the size of the Bill in which various possibilities for shortening it were mentioned. Two of the contributory factors are the switch to a calendar tax year and the introduction of the euro, both of which are necessary and rational and require a considerable volume of legal text given that they are integral parts of the tax system.</P>
      <P>The tax year commencing 6 April is an anachronism, a leftover from the 18th century. It seems to be much more rational to organise our tax affairs on a calendar year basis to align us with the rest of the world. It will inevitably cause extra work, not least for those who have drafted the Bill and the Legislature which must debate the measures in detail, but once the system is operational on a calendar year basis I am sure the benefits will be obvious to all and lead us to wonder why we persisted with the old system for so long.</P>
      <P>Because of the move to a calendar year system, various figures for tax reliefs, thresholds and so forth have had to be adjusted &ndash; roughly by three quarters &ndash; to take account of the fact that the 2001 tax year will end on 31 December. Where rounding of figures is necessary, this is done to the benefit of taxpayers. In a small number of cases as the reduction may prove unfair to the taxpayers concerned, the figures remain unchanged. I cite as an example the additional five year post-bereavement tax allowance for widowed parents.</P>
      <P>Regarding the euro, the Bill contains the necessary facilitative provisions. It follows the generally applied principle in regard to conversion to the euro, that is, of fairness to the taxpayer with no advantage being sought in the changeover. The Government is committed to that principle. The Bill provides that changes to a convenient amount in euro are rounded in favour of the citizen. This also applies in the case of penalties.</P>
      <P>The Bill also deals with more substantive measures. It provides for putting on a statutory footing the income tax changes announced in the budget. The income tax provisions are fully in line with what the Government promised in its programme and they implement the promises made in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> The increase in the personal allowances, when combined with the doubling of the PAYE allowance, will remove a further 133,000 persons from the tax net. This brings the total number of earners who have been taken out of the tax net to 668,000 or 38% approximately of all income earners. Since 1998, Government policies have almost doubled the number of people taken out of the tax net. This statistic is a measure of the success of our taxation policies in raising the living standards of the lower paid in particular.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that encouraging people into work by ensuring that they are not penalised through the tax system for taking up employment, is by far the best anti-poverty strategy over the longer term. The increase in the personal allowances and the PAYE allowance go some considerable way to the objective of exempting the minimum wage from taxation, as Deputy Mitchell has already acknowledged. For a single person the first £144 of weekly earnings will be free of tax. For a single income married couple in receipt of the home carer's allowance, the first £308 per week will be tax exempt. That is a very substantial figure.</P>
    <P>For the 62% of income earners who remain paying tax, the Finance Bill confirms the reduction in the rates of taxation which were announced in the budget. From 6 April this year, the standard rate of income tax will be 20%, which means the target that the Government set in its programme has been reached. Since this Government assumed office, a full six percentage points has been taken off the standard rate of tax. We have also reduced the top rate by six per centage points, in line with the commitment given in the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that another of the Government's key objectives in the taxation area is to have 80% of taxpayers not paying tax at the higher rate. To meet that objective, we have once again substantially widened the standard rate tax band. This will mean that from 6 April, a single person will pay tax at the new standard rate of 20% on the first £20,000 of annual income. Single earners make up more than 55% of income tax payers. For too many years, our tax system required persons on relatively modest incomes at around the average industrial wage, to pay the top rate of tax on marginal income. Increasing the standard rate band to £20,000 gives comfortable head room over the current average industrial wage. The latest phase of band widening means that the numbers paying tax at the top rate will fall to just 23% of all income earners.</P>
    <P>The Bill also completes the transition to the tax credit system. I am sure Deputies will agree that tax credits are a fairer method than tax allowances for delivering tax reliefs to taxpayers. This is because tax credits equalise the value of tax reliefs for all taxpayers, regardless of their income. A personal credit is worth the same to a person on £250 per week as to someone who enjoys a salary of £100,000 per year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> As part of the changeover to a tax credit system, the Bill provides for the delivery of tax relief for mortgage interest and for medical insurance at source. We have increased the tasks of our system of tax administration substantially in recent years, for good policy reasons. We have to keep in mind that the PAYE system was originally designed in the 1960s for a less complex era where the range of available tax reliefs was more limited, where the number of people at work was significantly lower and where employees tended to stay with one employer for many years.</P>
    <P>Tax relief at source will work in the following way. A person who has a medical insurance policy or makes a monthly mortgage repayment, will make his or her payment net of the tax relief. The medical insurance company, or bank, or building society will invoice the Revenue Commissioners for the tax relief. An important effect of this new approach will be that those persons who previously had insufficient income to qualify for all of the relief, will henceforth get the full tax relief as if they had the requisite income. Relief at source will remove an administrative overhead for taxpayers and for the Revenue Commissioners. For example, the new system will ensure that taxpayers will get the correct amount of relief even if the interest rate changes during the year. In such circumstances, there will no longer be any need for taxpayers to contact their local tax office.</P>
    <P>Taxation policies, combined with the prolonged success of the Irish economy over recent years, have enhanced the personal financial circumstances of a great many people. However, in times less fortunate than those we have been experiencing lately, the Irish people were noted for their generosity to good causes, particularly for the practical expression of their solidarity with those who were less well off, wherever they were to be found. For example, our generosity to the people of the Third World in Africa, Asia and South America, is well known, as are our activities relating to certain areas of central and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the selflessness that is characteristic of so many Irish people and which motivates them to give of their time and resources to charitable undertakings. We are anxious to support those companies and individuals who contribute so much to good causes and to encourage others to do likewise. That is why we have provided, in this Finance Bill, for a complete overhaul of the system of tax reliefs for charitable donations. Before this, there were a number of different reliefs for donations to charities and other good causes, including corporate donations to charities and donations for the benefit of heritage homes, universities and disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>Section 41 simplifies and extends the reliefs. Principally, the various restrictions on the nature of the activity to be assisted and the ceilings on maximum donations which would attract relief, <Col N="932" /> are being removed. For the first time, tax relief will be available for personal donations to charitably exempt bodies. There will be a <i>de minimis</i> relief of £250 per annum, but no upper limit.</P>
    <P>Relief will be granted at the taxpayer's marginal rate. In the interests of administrative convenience, the tax relief will generally be paid to the beneficiary of the donation. However, those on the self-assessment system will claim the relief and a similar arrangement will apply in the case of companies, who will claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the matter of tax relief in respect of share options, to which Deputy McDowell referred earlier. The House may be used to hearing that Ireland is a small, open economy but this fact bears repetition. We cannot afford to ignore the wider global trends. We have no option but to join the first movers in many of the emerging trends. The information technology sector has been one of the major contributors to our economic success in recent years. It is well known that, in that sector in particular but not exclusively so, share option arrangements are frequently a key component in employee remuneration packages. They allow employers to reward staff in ways that are linked to the performance of the company, having regard to pre-set targets. They are crucial to the motivation and retention of staff in circumstances where talented people can trade their skills in the global market.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill makes the necessary adjustments to the tax system so that companies located here can hold their own in the market for scarce skills. Under the relevant provisions in the Bill, share option schemes will have to be approved by the Revenue Commissioners in much the same way as other employee share schemes gain approval at present. Provided a scheme is approved, employees benefiting under it will not be chargeable to income tax on the exercise of their share option. Instead, the employee will be liable to capital gains tax on the full amount of the gain when he or she disposes of the shares.</P>
    <P>In order for the Revenue Commissioners to approve a share option scheme, a number of requirements will have to be satisfied. First, the shares must be held for at least three years, that is from the date the option is granted to the date the shares are sold. Second, the scheme must be open to all employees, in accordance with the &ldquo;similar terms&rdquo; rules. However, schemes may incorporate a &ldquo;key employee&rdquo; element which does not meet the &ldquo;similar terms&rdquo; conditions, provided at least 70% of the total amount of share options is being made available to all employees. There will not be any limit on the amount of shares that can avail of the tax treatment. There is not a requirement that the scheme must have a &ldquo;key employee&rdquo; element; it is simply an optional feature.</P>
    <P>The effective commencement date of the scheme is 15 February 2001, the date on which the scheme was announced. However, to qualify for the new relief, the scheme must be approved <Col N="933" /> by the Revenue Commissioners before 31 December 2001.</P>
    <P>We are confident the new share option scheme will provide employers with the necessary flexibility to structure remuneration packages to attract and retain quality people. We have striven hard in this country in terms of the resources devoted to education and training so that the quality of our human capital is as attractive as that found anywhere in the world. The share option scheme will be a factor in ensuring the best people will be retained here to contribute their talents to the continued development of the economy. It is to be hoped we will not lose the best in the way we lost so many talented people of previous generations.</P>
    <P>The overarching objective of the new savings scheme is to encourage regular savings by individuals. The main features of the scheme are as follows. It will commence on 1 May 2001 and accounts must be opened before 30 April 2002 to benefit. It will be open to financial institutions generally to participate. The Exchequer contribution will apply for a five year period only. Where a saver puts an amount of money into one of the new special accounts for the purposes of the scheme, the Exchequer will contribute an additional 25% of that amount. This is equivalent to giving tax relief on savings at the standard rate of income tax. Any income or gains from the savings investment will be taxed at 23%, and this will be deducted by the participating financial institutions at the end of the five years.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be open to every individual resident in the State who is 18 years of age or over. The scheme will make no distinction as to the status of the saver, so it will apply whether an individual is married or unmarried, employed or unemployed, or working outside the home or working in the home. However, an individual will be allowed to open only one account and, on doing so, will be required to supply his or her personal public service number to the financial institution concerned.</P>
    <P>There will be an overall limit of £200 on the amount an individual can lodge to an account in any one month. If that amount is lodged, the Exchequer's contribution to the account will be £50. The minimum amount which an individual must save per month to qualify for the scheme is a modest £10. However, the scheme provides for flexible arrangements so that an individual may save any amount in a month up to £200 over the remaining four year period.</P>
    <P>There will also be flexibility for the saver in the choice of institution with which he or she can open the new special accounts. I expect a range of bodies, such as banks, building societies, credit unions, life assurance companies and fund managers, will be anxious to get involved. The new scheme should greatly enhance competition among financial institutions in savings products which will be of considerable benefit to the average consumer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" /> A further feature of flexibility that should promote competition is that the saver will be able to transfer a special saving incentive account from one investment manager to another at any time during the five years. Such a change will not lead to a loss of the tax benefits accrued to the point of change. The saver will also enjoy choice in terms of the type of savings products in which he or she wishes to invest. An account can comprise investments in deposits, quoted shares, Government securities, collective funds or life assurance products, as determined by the account manager.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer's contributions to each account will be sent directly to the account manager and added to the savings in the account. I stress that the Government will not operate or guarantee the accounts or the return under them. This will be a matter between an individual and an account manager. Individuals who plan to open one of these accounts should assess any level of risk they wish to undertake.</P>
    <P>For the saver to gain maximum benefit from the savings in the scheme, the savings must be left for the full term which is five years. However, if there is an earlier withdrawal from an account other than on death, the full amount withdrawn, both savings and investment return, will suffer tax at 23%. The House should also be aware that there will be a prohibition on using an account as security for a loan.</P>
    <P>It has to be acknowledged that the very rapid economic growth of recent years has brought with it considerable pressures to parts of the economy where supply cannot react to demand factors over the shorter term. In that respect, one sector that is familiar to us all is housing. In the recent past, the Government has not hesitated from the use of fiscal measures to address aspects of housing demand and supply to prioritise certain needs. An example of this approach in the Bill is the rent a room scheme. This will give an incentive to people who have rooms to spare, because their children have grown up and moved on, for example, to make the extra accommodation available. Under the scheme a person who rents out a room or rooms in his or her principal private residence, will not pay tax on the rent up to a limit of £6,000. I emphasise that availing of the scheme will not affect a person's entitlement to mortgage interest relief on the property or the capital gains tax exemption available on the disposal of a principal private residence, nor will it trigger a clawback of stamp duty relief.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains part of the Government's response to the recommendations of the recent report of the commission on the private rented residential sector. Deputies will observe that tax relief in respect of interest on borrowings for the purchase of residential properties is being restored in certain restricted circumstances. To qualify, the property concerned must consist of at least three units and the total number of units must not be reduced below 50% of the number of units at the time of acquisition. At least 50% of the units must be available for letting to ten<Col N="935" /> ants who are in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance or any revised rent assistance arrangements that are put in place. The landlord must also comply with the relevant regulatory controls and must register tenancies with the proposed private residential tenancies board.</P>
    <P>There are two less conspicuous measures relating to housing which I would like to draw to the attention of the House. The exemption limit for stamp duty on mortgages is being raised tenfold from £20,000 to £200,000. Deputies will be aware that, as the market has surged, house purchasers, especially those doing so for the first time, are taking out larger mortgages. The substantial increase in the threshold will be of particular benefit to first time buyers. The Bill also changes the stamp duty arrangements where a parent transfers a house site to a child. In future there will be a complete exemption from stamp duty provided the house built on the site is the principal private residence of the child and it has a market value of less than £200,000. I am sure Deputies, especially those who represent rural constituencies, appreciate the importance of once-off houses built on land provided by parents. Not only do they help to ease pressures on the wider housing market, they also perform a valuable function in helping to maintain population levels and, with it, the fabric of social institutions in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised a point which was also raised on the Order of Business regarding the abolition of the 60% rate of capital gains tax. The purpose of the application of that rate from 6 April 2002 on zoned residential land disposals was to encourage the supply of such land prior to that date. This supply has greatly increased in the past two years and there has been a significant increase in full planning permissions granted in 2000 compared with 1999. If the 60% rate were to apply from 6 April 2002, it would mean the rate of capital gains tax on zoned residential land would be three times that on zoned commercial land, which would clearly result in land being diverted from residential to commercial development. That makes sense and clarifies the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why reduce the rate now? Why not in a year's time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister took the view that now is the time to do it and he is right in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter not unrelated to housing is the issue of the application of capital acquisitions tax to transfers of assets to foster children. The largest asset most of us bequeath is our residence. Given the stresses of contemporary family life, inevitably some parents are unable to cope and, therefore, children are placed by the authorities with foster parents. A regulatory regime has been in place for most fosterings since 1983 which means that the arrangements in individual cases from then on are a matter of public record. However, <Col N="936" /> fostering is a venerable custom in Ireland, and a great many cases predate the initiation of the regulatory system in 1983. Such fosterings may have been unconnected with instances of family breakdown. The child fostered was often a close relative of the foster parent. In fact, the regulatory system was not extended to the fostering of relatives until 1995.</P>
    <P>In those unregulated fostering cases many of the foster parents may be anxious to bequeath their property, in all probability their dwelling house, to their foster child. In many of those situations the disponer may have no children. For the purposes of capital acquisition tax rules a foster child was not treated as a blood child of the disponer and, therefore, entitled to the group one threshold, which is £316,800. If the foster child were a nephew or niece of the disponer the threshold would be £31,680; otherwise, the threshold would be that which applies for non-relatives or strangers which is £15,840. The Finance Bill will remedy these anomalies in respect of transfers to foster children by applying the group one threshold. To qualify, the beneficiary must have been cared for and maintained from a young age for at least five successive years up to the age of 18 by the foster parent and the child must have lived with the foster parent during this period. This is a fair and practical solution to a problem about which a number of Deputies expressed concern to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the importance of the proposal for tax relief in respect of share options. This relief may be availed of by small start-up companies in the high tech sector. A number of the high profile recently successful Irish companies with which we are all familiar had very small beginnings. Small and medium sized enterprises, no matter what sector they operate in, are a key component of business life.</P>
    <P>A favourable corporation tax regime already exists for companies with income from trading of less than £50,000 per annum. For such companies the 12.5% rate regime has already been put in place ahead of its general application in 2003. The Bill provides for the announcement made in the budget of an increase in the threshold to £200,000 with a system of marginal relief for trading income up to £250,000. It also confirms the changes announced in the budget regarding to capital allowances for plant and equipment. The seven year write-off is being reduced to five years. These changes will ensure that companies can better predict the financial environment in which they will operate. They will allow companies to plan investments in the full knowledge of how the investments and, hopefully, the resulting profits, will be dealt with by the tax system.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the considerable difficulties facing the Irish agriculture sector at present, largely due to market factors arising from BSE and because of the foot and mouth disease outbreak on our neighbouring island. I am sure these sentiments are shared by Deputies on all sides of the House. While farmers will benefit from the general <Col N="937" /> changes to the income tax regime in the same way as other self-employed persons, specifically, the Bill provides for the further extension to the stock relief provisions up to the end of 2002.</P>
    <P>The upgrading of our roads infrastructure has become an issue for farmers because more often than not the land needed for a new road must be acquired from farmers by way of a compulsory purchase order. I know the taxation provisions arising from such acquisitions have become a point of concern for the farming organisations. Under the capital gains tax heading, the Bill provides for an amendment of the arrangements for roll-over relief in terms of the time available for reinvesting the proceeds of the compulsory acquisition. The new time frame will be two years before and four years after the disposal of the farmland. Similarly, agricultural relief under the capital acquisitions tax code is being amended so that the period for reinvestment of proceeds is being extended from one year to four years.</P>
    <P>The Government's taxation polices have been a considerable factor in helping to cultivate the enterprise dynamic that is now so notable in the Irish economy and more widely in Irish society. The virtues of hard work, creativity, risk-taking and thrift are being rewarded, as they should. The Government's budgetary and tax policies must be seen within the context of a rapidly growing economy.</P>
    <P>The performance of the economy in recent years has been outstanding. Growth in GNP has averaged 7.5% per annum since 1993. Last year growth is estimated to have been more than 8% while prospects for this year remain favourable despite the slowing of the US economy. The turnaround in the Irish economy is reflected in our changed labour market circumstances.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is currently at its lowest level of any time in our history. Today, it stands at 3.6% &ndash; less that half the EU average. When this Government came into office it stood at over 10%. This is a remarkable achievement. Substantial job creation lies behind these statistics. More than 200,000 net additional jobs have been created during this Government's period in office. Whereas employment was only a little over one million in 1986, it stood at over 1.7 million last year.</P>
    <P>The better economic situation has also led to a large rise in Irish living standards which are now close to the EU average. This compares favourably with 1990 when our living standards were 74% of the EU average. Much of our economic prosperity has been used to improve the public finances. For the first time in over a generation substantial budget surpluses have replaced deficits. Last year Ireland had the highest budget surplus of any member state in the European Union, at 4.6% of GDP. It is worth noting that nine of the 14 other EU states are running fiscal deficits.</P>
    <P>Government debt has fallen dramatically. The debt to GDP ratio was 65% in 1997 and was under 40% in 2000. Ireland now has the second lowest debt in the European Union, after Luxem<Col N="938" /> bourg. Moreover, as the House is aware we are setting aside moneys for future pension liabilities. At present we are benefiting from very favourable demographic circumstances with large increases in the working age population. Over time these trends will become less favourable with the number of persons aged 65 and over projected to increase.</P>
    <P>To prepare for the impact of these demographic changes, the binding commitment to pay 1% of GNP each year into a national pension fund is an innovative and imaginative step. Already this fund amounts to more than 7% of GNP. There are a number of longer-term factors that help explain our economic success. The budget sought to achieve economic stability and reduce economic pressures by securing wage moderation by preserving our social partnership, by countering inflationary expectations by proactive indirect tax cuts, by promoting increased savings in the economy, and by encouraging more labour supply and productivity by targeted direct tax reductions.</P>
    <P>The Government is also investing heavily in our future. A sum of £41 billion earmarked under the national development plan is aimed at addressing our infrastructural bottlenecks while putting in place the infrastructure necessary to support a growing economy. Our budgetary policies are also providing for the less-well off. The successful management of the economy has allowed us to almost double health spending in our term in office, increase State pensions substantially and direct greater resources to education. We are not only increasing national wealth but we are also distributing it more fairly.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill 2001 contains a practical set of measures that take account of the needs of the economy and of society as a whole. It is the production of a Government that understands the rapid change that is taking place and is proactive in its approach to the role of fiscal measures in overall economic management. On Committee Stage the Bill will be enhanced by further innovative measures which the Minister signalled in his Second Stage speech yesterday.</P>
    <P>I confidently urge the House, therefore, to support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill which is the most important legislation to come before the House this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Government on a number of issues. I have a grudging respect for the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, as I too am a free marketeer. He is pursuing some of his economic policies in the right way. He has had the courage of his convictions on a number of issues and has <Col N="939" /> made mistakes in others. However, if one does not try to do things differently, one will never be had for making mistakes. I would not discredit the Minister for making mistakes.</P>
    <P>A number of schemes introduced by the Minister for Finance in the past couple of years, such as the rural renewal scheme in Longford-Leitrim-Roscommon and parts of Sligo, have been helpful. That scheme has been very beneficial to the area. The Minister also made a number of mistakes regarding the third Bacon report but I will deal with them later.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the new approach of co-ordinating the tax and calendar years. That is logical and should have been done years ago. I listened to the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, regarding taxation. I welcome the conversion of the Minister, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to the tax credit system. That was the main plank of the rainbow coalition's tax policy during the last election. The Government strongly opposed it, but now it has come on board and introduced it. I welcome that. However, I suppose Fianna Fáil finds it difficult to change and will take credit for a system it opposed. Old habits die hard, however&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;we accept those things.</P>
      <P>I have the honour of being spokesman on western and rural development for Fine Gael and have listened to the Minister of State summing up in his speech. He said:</P>
      <P>The Government is also investing heavily in our future. A sum of £41 billion earmarked under the national development plan is aimed at addressing our infrastructural bottlenecks while putting in place the infrastructure necessary to support a growing economy.</P>
      <P>I agree with that aspiration, but I will point to some facts about the situation in the west.</P>
      <P>While the western region accounts for 37% of the country's land mass and 18% of the national population it accounted for a mere 9.5% of national net industrial output in 1996. Latest research shows that this share is falling. That is a damning indictment of the Government's economic policy in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is abysmal access to the area. The majority of visitors, 85%, enter the country <i>via</i> the east coast. However, the main access routes to the north and west by road, rail and air are in a very poor state and the consequence is lost revenue to the region from business and tourism. Maps showing where development will take place under the national development plan of railways, roadways, air infrastructure and energy indicate that there is no development or financial expenditure in the northwest and western regions. We have a difficulty with the N4 and N5 roads. Money is not provided to bring them to dual-car<Col N="940" /> riageway or motorway status in the northwest and western regions.</P>
    <P>How in God's name can we bring economic development and industry into the area if the Government is not willing to provide the necessary funding for that type of infrastructural development? No money is to be provided in the next six years for that sort of infrastructural development in the west until 2006. They are facts.</P>
    <P>The most damning indictment of all is that latest research shows that the national net industrial output continues to fall. What will this Government do for us? What has this Bill done for us? Nothing. Not one single thing.</P>
    <P>I welcomed, this morning, the Government's U-turn with regard to the third Bacon report which introduced the 9% rate of stamp duty on investment property. It has now reduced that to 3% which is welcome, but that should not have happened. What was the logic in providing a rural renewal tax incentive for the areas of Sligo, Leitrim, Longford and parts of Roscommon and Cavan, introducing investment which was necessary to sustain the area and then as part of Government policy, introducing the third Bacon report, and a 9% increase in the rate of stamp duty on investment property? It stopped a great deal of investment taking place.</P>
    <P>I am involved in the business of providing to the building industry and saw, once that 9% was put in place, house building in that area stopped. I am not sure if it can be resurrected with the rate of 3%. Fine Gael policy is not to have any sort of tax on investment property. We stated that when the third Bacon report was introduced and still believe it. The 3% rate is not adequate. When the Government realised it had made a mistake it should have been willing to get rid of the entire 9% stamp duty. The 3% rate is a fig leaf and I do not know whether it will solve the problems already there. The Minister of State in his speech welcomed the drop in the rate of unemployment from 10% under the last Government to around 6%.</P>
    <P>The entire western region outside Galway attracted just 5% of new IDA jobs last year and 3% the year before. That is horrendous. What needs to be put in place to solve the imbalance is a co-ordinated policy, led by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. Some 5% of all jobs created were put into nine counties in the western and north-western regions. That is abysmal. It is another issue which shows that the Government is not looking at the development of the entire country but at the development of the east coast, the south-east coast and the south. It does not look at the economic development of the whole country. These figures and facts show that.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Government will do or proposes to do about that. There is certainly nothing in the Bill or in the budget. We have much work to do and the Government should concentrate on doing that rather than trying to take credit for one of the strongest economies <Col N="941" /> and financially viable situations in which we have ever found ourselves. The money is not being spent properly or in a structured way so that everyone involved in the economy will be helped by the financial structures we have.</P>
    <P>With regard to energy in the west, the western region has no major indigenous source of power and the national grid into the region is 30 years out of date and inadequate. Industries in the region increasingly suffer from &ldquo;outages&rdquo; and no major industry could invest northwest of a line from Galway to Dundalk. No money has been provided for in the national development plan to provide natural gas to the western region from the natural gas find off the west coast.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Government has not taken the opportunity to provide funding for economic and infrastructural development in the west. The issues I raised do not fall under the heading of parochial concerns or any &ldquo;moan&rdquo; mentality. They represent deep structural and strategic differences in economic planning which undermine national economic performance, especially at a time when the east coast cannot cope with much more development. That is an indictment of the Government's policy on western development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, though speaking time is limited. There are a number of points I wish to address which not only affect certain regions of the country but the country as a whole. For example, the decision by the Government to remove the cap on PSRI will have major implications throughout the country but will have a detrimental impact in the regions most affected by employment, in the midland, the BMW region and the west.</P>
      <P>The companies involved will be the manufacturing industries, especially those in the electronic sector. The removal of the PSRI ceiling will make high-tech employers, considering research and development investment in Ireland, think twice following the passing of the Bill. The measures in the Bill counteract both Government and IDA stated objectives of encouraging high tech employers to locate research and development facilities here. The Government has added costs to employers in the high tech sector which will restrict recruitment of much needed highly skilled personnel.</P>
      <P>Many of the key personnel required for such facilities earn more than £36,000 and under the PRSI changes they will be taxed an additional £120 per £1,000 of salary. The changes in the budget are a tax on encouraging the development of world class private research facilities. Given that the work force is so mobile, similar companies in other economies will have a competitive advantage. This will inhibit the Government's aim to increase the value chain in employment and to attract new jobs and investment to the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to attract high-tech investment, yet we are failing to do this. It is stated IDA policy <Col N="942" /> that 50% of all new green field developments must go to the BMW region. However, the IDA admits privately that this will not happen. The problem is that the vast proportion of employment growth from now on will be in expansion rather than in new green field investment. The potential for expansion still remains in developed areas and the greater Dublin region. Until this expansion is extended to areas outside Dublin the BMW region will be on the hind tit in terms of development.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget Statement said the reduction of 1% in the top rate of VAT from 21% to 20% would help e-commerce. However, there is no vision in the budget or Finance Bill in relation to e-commerce. We need a special VAT rate for e-commerce sales abroad. An imaginative proposal to stimulate sales on the web could have been brought forward but it was ignored. The VAT rate of 20% is a long way short of the Luxembourg rate of 15%. Under EU legislation, VAT is charged in the country where the product is manufactured rather than in the country where it is bought.</P>
    <P>We are at a competitive disadvantage in terms of the United States and selling into that country. It is a huge disappointment that the Government has not addressed this issue in terms of e-commerce, which has the potential to ensure balanced regional development. This morning I came across an article in <i>Magill</i> which highlights the Government's focus on technology and e-commerce. An e-mail was sent to all Members of the House, yet only one of the 15 members of Cabinet responded to this request for information. The Government talks about the need to develop e-commerce and high technology industry, yet it has not responded to an e-mail which asked three simple questions. This is a true test of the objectives of the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds referred to the infrastructural deficit. Even though it has limited objectives in relation to the BMW, west and north west regions, the NDP will not be delivered on time. It already takes up to six years from the initiation of a major water scheme to its delivery. This is due to bureaucratic delays, which the Government has continued to ignore and failed to address. The chronic labour shortages within the construction industry have also not been addressed. Employers have to hire people from other countries to take up vacant positions, yet there is not adequate low cost housing or rented accommodation available because of the decision made by the Government last July to crucify the private rented sector. While the Minister announced changes last night, they are still a long way short of what is needed.</P>
    <P>I will address one aspect of infrastructure which is of extreme importance, that is, compulsory purchase orders. The only decision taken was to extend the period for reinvestment of the funding from CPOs. There were no changes in the level of taxation. Additional allocations could have been provided for in the budget to ensure <Col N="943" /> that agreements with landowners and householders were settled at an earlier date and that they got a fair and reasonable price for their property and to ensure that developments, including fibre optic cable, gas and motorways, were delivered within the time schedule. The token response by the Minister and Government to this issue will not have any impact in ensuring that roads are delivered on time and that farmers and house owners get a decent price for their land. I know this only too well as the M6 will run through my family's farm. If some imagination was used, there would have been agreement and work on these roads could have commenced much quicker. These roads are fundamentally important to the development of the regions.</P>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach said that 50,000 extra housing units would have to be constructed every year. Yet local authorities are still short-changed in terms of planning staff and engineers. My local authority is short three or four planning staff and has a chronic shortage of engineers. How can we expect these objectives to be delivered if local authorities do not have the necessary staff?</P>
    <P>The issue of child care, which is fundamental to bringing more people into employment, has not been properly addressed by the Government. Deputy Mitchell highlighted the Government's incompetence in relation to child care. It has ignored the issue and has not put in place the necessary structures which would tackle some of the fundamental problems and support young couples who wish to participate in the work force but who cannot do so because of the astronomical cost of child care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome many of the changes proposed in the Bill, not least the guarantee that the social welfare payments will be brought forward to 1 January in line with the change in the tax year. There is little point in announcing measures which are not introduced for six or 12 months. This is a step forward.</P>
      <P>I welcome the tax relief on donations to charities. I encourage the Government to increase funding for Third World countries. At a time when the Government has a massive amount of finance, which is due to the hard work of employees, it should play a role in trying to save lives and help to alleviate desperate situations throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the savings scheme announced by the Minister. It is good to encourage young people to save. Many of them have to borrow money from their parents or somebody else for the deposit for a house which is almost unaffordable. This scheme may appease the European Commission which the Minister for Finance totally ignored. In light of the foot and mouth disease and BSE problems and given the benefits we have enjoyed from membership of the EU and that much of our economic success is due to EU support, we cannot afford to ignore measures we <Col N="944" /> agreed at EU Commission level. We will gain some brownie points as a result of this savings initiative.</P>
    <P>Child care and child benefit have been mentioned. I welcome the increase in child benefit as something the Fine Gael Party proposed in recent years as a direct means for the mother or father in the home to cover their needs. The child care issue requires urgent attention. The Government has not provided the necessary child care facilities to give people the option to work if they so wish.</P>
    <P>In the area of taxation, while there is no doubt that there have been major improvements, the low-paid still suffer. In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan the food industry and furniture production are not the areas in which there were high earnings. From 1 April a person earning £200 per week will gain £10 or less while a person earning £1,000 per week will gain £50. Is this natural justice? There is still a long way to go. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, has promised that every person earning less than £200 will be removed from the tax net next year &ndash; live horse and you will get grass. There should be greater fairness.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with farming. I was thrilled when I read the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, the highlight of which was farmer taxation. He had some pleasant words to say such as that he appreciates the difficulties of farmers. It was clear after the first few lines, however, that his solace for farming was extremely limited. In the budget the level of VAT returned to farmers was increased from 4.2% to 4.3%, a miserly increase of 0.1%. The Minister of State dealt with other taxes in respect of infrastructure. He declared that for tax purposes they will go back two years and forward three years as far as disposals are concerned. How will long-term leases be dealt with? Many farmers who had no indication that their land would be used for infrastructure entered into ten year leases for EU purposes and five and six year leases for decision purposes. This time period must be taken into account when the infrastructure issue is being discussed. We must be realistic and ensure no individual farmer is made to bear unnecessary costs.</P>
    <P>Although Cavan-Monaghan accounts for two thirds of the poultry produced on the island, there have been no benefits for the industry which is on its knees. For four years the IFA has been asking in its submission to the Minister that the level of excise duty on non-automated LPG, 1.43p per litre or 6.5p per gallon, be either zero rated or removed by whatever means. EEC Council Directive 92/82 allows LPG, methane and kerosene used for heating purposes from 1 January 1993 to be zero rated. Currently there is no excise duty on natural gas, supplies of which are not available in north Monaghan, a rebate of excise duty on non-automated LPG for mushroom production and glasshouse production and on kerosene in mushroom production. Why can the Minister not provide for this in the case of the poultry industry? All that is being sought is a <Col N="945" /> rebate of excise duty on non-automated fuels used in the industry for heating purposes. That is the least for which we can ask for a major industry that is on its knees and subject to meat imports. There is a need to look again at that area. We are aware of how foot and mouth disease was imported in the United Kingdom. There is a need to look at the areas from which we import poultry products and how we can place our own industry and the agriculture sector as a whole at risk. The economy is at risk from these imports.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to biomass and the use of agricultural and other wastes, an issue on which I have been working for the past seven or eight years. There is agreement from Brussels that there can be movement. We are in possession of the licence and so on. If the Government is serious about this matter, it must provide for tax benefits and grants to ensure waste is used as a means of generating power and heat to cater for the needs of the north east and west, as outlined by Deputy Gerry Reynolds, where there is an electricity shortage. It is interesting to note that Denmark produces 2,500 megawatts of electricity using wind. By 2010 it expects to meet half its requirements for electricity using wind power and other natural sources. Our record for the same period is a magical 55 megawatts. There is a golden opportunity to utilise a natural product &ndash; the wind that comes from the Almighty. Those interested in going down that road must have the same opportunities as those in Denmark. The wherewithal must be created to ensure this happens. In view of the funds available to the Government, I ask for tax breaks and grants. The European Union would strongly support such a move, if we have not already broken our bridges.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Brendan Smith and Michael Moynihan.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this excellent Finance Bill which is a declaration of the way in which our resources are to be directed as never before towards meeting the needs of the poor, the underprivileged and the aged. It is about spreading the wealth and supporting the weak.</P>
      <P>In this the Government's fourth budget there is tremendous progress in the area of personal tax reform. Rates have been cut, bands widened and allowances raised. More than 77% of earners have been removed from the top rate tax net, while 38 per cent have been removed from the tax net altogether. This is real tax reform. The introduction of tax credits was the most significant and far-reaching reform of our personal tax system in a generation. With this year's budget, the transition, first indicated two years ago, is complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government introduced the minimum wage which I hope it will make tax free. The Government has an excellent record on tax reform in the past three-and-a-half years. Compare this with what happened under the previous <Col N="946" /> Administration and consider what the position was in 1997 when a single person entered the tax net at £77 per week. That figure has now been raised to £144 per week. In 1997 a single person hit the top rate of tax on an annual income of just £13,600, little more than £260 per week. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has been able to increase that figure to £20,000 per year and indicated that there will be further band widening in the next budget in October to ensure that the vast majority of people on middle incomes no longer pay tax at the top rate. In 1997 the basic rate of income tax was 26%. That rate is now down to a much more reasonable level of 20% in line with the commitments set out in the joint programme for Government. While the top rate of tax has been reduced from 48% to 42%, it is now accepted that low marginal rates are an important economic incentive and in the long-term low marginal rates generate more revenue for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>One of the major contributors to Irish economic success has been our low rate of corporation tax. The idea has been to use the 10% rate and now the 12.5% rate as a magnet to attract more investment into the country. We have used low tax rates to attract companies to this country. If we wish Ireland to develop as a high skill, high income economy, we will have to focus more on modern high technology industries such as information technology, telecommunications, international financial services and bio-technology. If we want to keep Irish people with the requisite skills at home, attract former emigrants to return here and new people to come and work in this country, it is vital that we offer them an attractive personal tax package.</P>
    <P>The Government is very conscious of the need to keep inflation under control. Inflation which devalues the savings of pensioners and the incomes of people on welfare also damages our competitive position as an exporting nation and, if left unchecked, would threaten the foundation on which our economic boom is built. The rise in inflation in the course of the past year was principally due to external practice beyond the control of any Government. The sharp rise in the price of oil and the sharp fall in the value of our currency pushed prices up right across the economy in recent months. The international backdrop is becoming more favourable now and the euro has rallied strongly against sterling and the dollar in recent weeks. The Government has demonstrated in the budget its commitment to combat inflation.</P>
    <P>On the substantial increases in the old age pension, over four years the basic rate has been increased by £28, an increase of 36% in four years, well above the rate of inflation over the same period. This supports families. The family is the key element in our community and in society. The provision of a decent and comfortable quality of life into old age is a fundamental entitlement. A person's worth does not end with retirement. This Finance Bill focuses on support for people with disabilities and for carers. The budget <Col N="947" /> provides in total for additional social welfare expenditure of £850 million. This is four times the level the rainbow Government provided in its last year in office.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill contains the most substantial increases in child benefit since the payment was introduced in the form of children's allowance. This is just the first of three years of increases which will see investment in the payment rise by £1 billion by 2003, almost a threefold increase. The Finance Bill is increasing child benefit by £25 per month for the first two children and £30 for the third and subsequent children, payable from June 2001. In this the first of a three year commitment, a family with four children will receive in excess of £300 per month or £70 per week in child benefit. These increases will be payable to all families including those who choose to go out to work, those who use paid child care, those with informal child care arrangements and those who choose to work in the home and care for their children in that way.</P>
    <P>From June of this year, a full three months earlier than normal, some 532,000 families with a total of more than one million children will benefit from the support this Government will provide through the enhanced child benefit scheme. Expenditure on the school meals community programme is being increased from £100,000 to £300,000 per year. This programme which was launched by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in September, provides 100% funding of food costs for established community schools meals. Some 16 projects providing breakfast clubs, lunches and after school meals are currently funded, with more than 2,000 children having the benefit of this excellent programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement that maternity leave will be extended to a total of 26 weeks, with an increase to 18 weeks paid leave. Provision is made for payment of four weeks additional maternity benefit which will be available also to adoptive parents. The minimum amount of maternity and adoptive benefits is to be increased by £8, bringing the maximum rate of these benefits to £183 per week, an increase of more than £10 per week. Some 10,000 people on disability payments are receiving an additional allowance as are 15,000 carers.</P>
    <P>In last year's budget, we welcomed the extension of the free schemes to everyone aged 75 years or over, regardless of income. However, this year the free schemes have been extended to everyone over 70 years of age, which is welcome. This recognises the major contribution of older people in our community and society.  </P>
    <P>The fuel allowance scheme has been extended by two weeks. It will now be paid for the first week in October to late April. Here I appeal for a further extension of the scheme, as it is a tremendous benefit. I also welcome the easing of the means test for receipt of the fuel allowance. Up to now, people with contribution pensions, <Col N="948" /> such as retirement pensions or widows' contributory pension, qualified for fuel allowances if their income from other sources was not more than £30 per week. This is being increased to £40 per week from the beginning of the next fuel season. This will be very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, on his new carer's benefit scheme which will be extremely beneficial to those carers who experience the tremendous difficulties involved in caring and working full time. The scheme, which was introduced last October, allows carers to leave the work force for up to 15 months and receive a non-means tested payment. In addition, a unique feature of this new scheme will be the retention of the carer's employment rights for that period.</P>
    <P>Carer's allowance is subject to a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his or her partner is assessable. The present figures are £75 per week for a single carer and a disregard of £150 per week is applied to the joint means of a couple. These figures have now been increased. A single person can have an income disregard of £125 and a couple can have a joint income disregard of £250. This measure will increase the payment of almost 3,000 recipients of carer's allowance. It will also ensure that an additional 5,000 carers will qualify for a payment. The measure will come into effect in April 2001 at a cost of £80 million, representing a huge increase in expenditure on carers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the special savings scheme, the objective of which is to encourage regular savings by individuals. The scheme, which will commence in May 2001, must be welcomed.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important legislation, the Finance Bill 2001, which will bring major benefits to the people. When introducing the Bill, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, referred to the proposed changes in the finance year to bring it into line with the calendar year. That is a welcome development which removes one of the vestiges of a bygone era.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, said this morning that the taxation measures will ensure that a further 133,000 people are removed from the tax net, which is a very impressive figure.</P>
      <P>The commitments made by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats before the 1997 general election have been honoured. The taxation programme we put before the people has been fully implemented. Approximately 668,000 people or 38% of all income earners have been removed from the tax net. That is a welcome development. As public representatives we would have heard people in the 1980s and 1990s clamour for changes to the tax code and for improvements in the levels of personal taxation.</P>
      <P>Thankfully there has been substantial job creation over the years. New job opportunities have been created in rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation for salaries, wages and expenses for my Department in the 2001 Estimates is £6.5 million. The increase on the 2000 allocation is due to a number of factors.</P>
      <P>A substantial part of the increase relates to the pay increases agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The balance relates to increased resources to provide an improved service in important areas such as EU and international affairs and regulatory reform. It also provides for improved support services, including in the Government Press Office, internal audit, information technology and the Department's website and library. There are additional costs related to staff allowances and pay costs for staff returning to the Department from career breaks or other duties. There is also provision for annual pay increments, increased employer's PRSI costs and staff upgradings under agreements between the unions and the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. I suspect I may have to come back to him with more detailed questions because there was a great deal of information in his response. Does the increase of 25%, set against a background where there is the dispute with the teachers, not to mention other possible disputes, represent net additional moneys or does it include people who have been transferred from one Vote to another such as people transferring from other Departments to his Department, or is it all real additional money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I gave a lengthy reply is that there is no one big figure &ndash; there are about 14 or 15 areas. As Deputy Quinn would <Col N="950" /> acknowledge, the base on the staff side in the Department of the Taoiseach is small so that gives the increases. There are no big movements &ndash; it is all built on the estimated outturn extrapolated from the outturn of what was based on a no change basis, say, taking into account special pay increases. I have the breakdown, if the Deputy wishes me to run through it.</P>

      <P>The provisional outturn is £5.7 million. The estimated outturn extrapolated from the outturn on a no change basis taking into account pay increases from 1 October last, which are not included in that, brings it up to £6.046 million. On additional posts of which there are two or three, the figure is approximately £120,000 and that includes an assistant secretary. There are increases in allowances for four staff which amounts to £32,000. On staff returning &ndash; a higher executive officer and a clerical officer &ndash; the figure is £46,000. The figure for a professional accountant is £30,000. PRSI averaged 4.4% and increments and superannuations were 1.2% at £136,000. There is an adjustment for the pay increase as per 1 October next, which is £90,000. That brings the figure up to £6.5 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The additional posts include a principal officer to assistant secretary post. There is a principal officer post, which I think is a higher grade principal officer post, and there is an assistant secretary post, which was not filled for most of last year but which has now been filled. They are the only additional posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach find it somewhat disconcerting, notwithstanding that he is the Taoiseach, that his Department does not seem to have any difficulty getting extra personnel and having those posts filled whereas there is literally a procession of additional posts that have been sanctioned but which cannot be filled? Is he concerned that right across the public service, certainly in Departments about which we have asked specific questions, there are substantial numbers of vacancies for posts which are already there and in respect of new posts? As we saw yesterday, personnel cannot be found. Will the Taoiseach indicate if he proposes any action in relation to the filling of the vacancies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regrettably, I do not have the figure for my Department but I think I have given it here quite recently. There is a large number of unfilled posts in my Department because people from different grades have left. Overall, we have had a number of conversations and plans with the Civil Service Commission. It has upped and changed quite a large number of its positions. The former secretary to the Government, Mr. Murray, on retirement moved in to assist in the efforts. It <Col N="951" /> has revamped a number of procedures for filling posts to quicken up the process. It has held a large number of competitions to fill the posts.</P>
      <P>Having said that, last year I think movement across Departments was far higher but, equally, the number of vacancies across Departments increased in line with the people leaving in recent years. That will continue this year. Until 1998, there would have been competitions for most grades in the Civil Service every third year and, in some cases, every fifth year. In recent years, there has been a competition every year and that, in itself, has put pressure on the whole organisation. The Civil Service Commissioners are conscious of their obligations to try to create panels and to quickly recruit people to the additional posts. I also have that problem and there is a large number of posts in my Department, particularly at the lower end scales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept, given his responsibility for the Government, that there is now a management crisis in Government due to the shortage of personnel right across the main Departments? If he accepts there is a crisis, what action does he propose to take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider it a crisis. We have to endeavour to fill any vacancies. Traditionally, people tended to stay in the Civil Service for a variety of reasons. There is a large number of opportunities in the private sectors. The Deputy will have seen the figures in recent days and the ILO figures show that there is only 2.6% unemployment in the greater Dublin area. It is only in the Border region that there is any level of unemployment. That is creating pressures and demand for people and for jobs.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service Commission has responded to that by changing its procedures to allow it to hold competitions and exams which, while not overly difficult, produce a desirable calibre of civil servants. It is becoming increasingly difficult to attract people into the Civil Service and keep them there, but the commission is doing its utmost to address the situation.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Progress on the Government programme is constantly kept under review. Deputy Noonan will be aware that last year the third annual progress report was published and I propose to publish another progress report this summer. The action programme and its mid-term review contain 535 specific commitments and 44 months after the last election, more than three quarters of the objectives and action points have <Col N="952" /> been achieved or significant progress has been made.</P>
      <P>In implementing our commitments, we have brought forward and progressed one of the most ambitious legislative programmes in the history of the State. Since this Government took office on 26 June 1997, an unprecedented 145 Bills have been enacted. In addition, there are currently 45 Bills before the Oireachtas. Given the scale of the Government's legislative programme and the large number of specific commitments set out in the action programme, it would be impossible in the allotted time to fully detail the immense amount of progress we have delivered.</P>
      <P>The cornerstones of our action programme were based on our desire to build a better Ireland for everyone and our core promises at the last election were to cut unemployment, taxes and crime and to work to build a lasting peace on this island. We have delivered on all these.</P>
      <P>We said we would cut unemployment and we have done so. No Government has done more in addressing one of the major sources of disadvantage in our country, that of joblessness. We have been responsible for the implementation of policies which have led to the creation of over 300,000 jobs, a dramatic reduction in unemployment from 10.7% to 3.8% and long-term unemployment from 4.6% to 1.2%. Going forward, we are implementing policies to make certain that every single unemployed person in this country is offered a full opportunity and support to get back to work in their own locality.</P>
      <P>We said we would cut crime and we have done so. Figures have fallen by an unprecedented 21% since this Government took office. Alongside the drop in crime, the detection rate for recorded crime has increased significantly over our period in office. Ireland now has a detection rate of 44% compared to 21% in the USA and 26% in the UK. This is simply because this Government has given, as promised, the Garda Síochána the resources to police our streets, waterways and air spaces as never before. We have also ended the revolving door syndrome in our prisons and have invested unprecedented funding in crime prevention measures.</P>
      <P>We promised to cut taxes and we have done so. We have introduced large tax cuts in each budget which have resulted in real increases in take home pay for all sections of the labour force. We have reduced the standard rate of tax from 26% to 20% and the higher rate from 48% to 42%. We have removed 310,000 income earners from the tax net and have moved 268,000 income earners from the higher rate to the standard rate of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We said we would restore peace and we have done so. Within weeks of our return to power, the IRA announced another ceasefire which has held. The Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent referenda clearly demonstrated that the people of this island wanted their politicians to put in place and operate structures set out in the Agreement, which were based on equality, toler<Col N="953" /> ance, mutual respect and a desire to see a society, which for so long has been ravaged from within, reach its full potential. Building peace in Northern Ireland, based on a just settlement, is painstaking but rewarding work.</P>
    <P>While many real and serious challenges remain, we have all come too far together not to overcome these. I am very proud of the record of the Government in setting out an ambitious programme, earning the support of the electorate and implementing its promises in office. Over the course of the next year we will complete this work and be in a position to present to the people an unprecedented record of delivery and achievement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. However, there is another way of telling the story. The Government's economic policies have widened the gap between the rich and the poor. There has been a total failure to implement a coherent policy to tackle traffic. The Government has an abysmal record on the environment, particularly in the area of environmental protection where a number of important EU directives remain to be implemented.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that no progress has been made in eliminating the bottlenecks caused by our infrastructural deficit. It is a bit rich that years after the Government's pronouncements about what it intended to do, it is still boasting about progress on projects which are part of the development plan, such as the Dublin port tunnel and Luas, of which we have seen very little evidence.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in a time of unprecedented prosperity the Government is incapable of providing the most basic health services to the public? Is he aware that an accident and emergency consultant at St. James's hospital was forced to resign because the accident and emergency department in the hospital was in complete disarray? Perhaps the Taoiseach should consider whether that nice young man, the Minister, Deputy Martin, is in a job which is too demanding for him and whether one of his heavy hitters could sort out the mess in the Department of Health and Children.</P>

It is hoped that, for the first time, the Minister for Health and Children will succeed in convincing health professionals that accident and emergency consultants should work after 6 p.m. That has not happened since the foundation of the State. Until relatively recently, there was only a handful of such consultants in the Republic.</P>

      <P>Development is ongoing <Col N="955" /> throughout the country, particularly on the northern fringe where roads projects at Cloghran, Lissenhall, Dundalk, Dunleer and Drogheda are either completed or nearing completion. The Limerick bypass is being constructed on a public-private partnership basis. We also have the Nenagh and Waterford bypasses. Some £40 billion worth of projects have been sanctioned.</P>
      <P>If one looks back at previous election manifestos, traffic and housing were not mentioned. Obviously, they were not considered priority issues. The fact that institutional arrangements have since been put in place and the establishment of the infrastructural committee to address these issues shows how far we have come. We are in a different position from the difficult days of 1996 and early 1997. Hopefully we will not go back to those days.</P>

      <P>It is comforting for the Opposition to hear the Taoiseach whistling past the graveyard. Is he aware that Councillor John Minihan, chairman of the Progressive Democrats, stated last Thursday night that the national development plan's road programme will not be finished until 2010, four years after the deadline. Is Councillor Minihan correct? Did he get his information from the Tánaiste or is he suffering from one of the hallucinations from which members of that party frequently suffer?</P>

      <P>Recently I gave a list of road projects, some of which drifted into 2007. There are some planning difficulties. By and large, it is accepted that the programme will be ahead of schedule. A fortnight ago, the NRA stated that its project teams had been established and project managers were in place. I congratulate Mr. Tobin and his colleagues because in the autumn of 1999, just before the national development plan, it appeared these projects would continue until 2115. The Dublin-Belfast corridor, which is so economically important to the whole island, has made enormous progress recently.</P>
      <P>I admit to Deputy Noonan that the increase in population and car numbers has created problems. Through the 1980s we lost, under all Administrations, about 400,000 people. At the beginning of the 1990s, demographic forecasts indicated that our population would be approximately 3.4 million. People planned on that basis. Even in 1993 a report stated we would reach 3.5 million by 2003. The current population is approximately 4 million, as the next census may confirm. The increase in population and car ownership means there are infrastructural deficiencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one reason I disagree with the recommendation from Commissioner Pedro Solbes to cut back on our infrastructural programme. These <Col N="956" /> difficulties have built up over years. In a country where exports have increased proportionally by five to one higher than any other OECD country, we need more infrastructure. We have to continue with this. Everything is not perfect but in a few years we moved from a stock position to one of enormous infrastructural development across all areas of life. There is more to do and I look forward to doing it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I accept that. When this was being discussed some years ago, everyone stated that we could not do what we have done in Waterford. I acknowledge that Deputy Quinn did raise that. It was done across county councils. The experts say that in the case of Waterford the project has been shortened by five years.</P>

      <P>Some will drift into 2007. Some of these roads were not expected to be completed until 2012.</P>
      <P>On the second part of the question, a work permits Bill is coming before the House. Last year 20,000 non-EU people came through that system, compared to 800 more recently. It is a large number of people. There is a problem in that employers have a long delay, particularly in certain industries. I acknowledge that they need greater certainty and a faster turn around. Additional staff were employed to expedite matters. With the range of countries from which people come and the checking system, it is still too slow. They are streamlining that again to make it less bureaucratic and simpler. The old system which dealt with only a few hundred applicants is too cumbersome. Subject to correction, the new system was introduced earlier this year and that is desirable.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in that our unemployment rate is under 3.5% . In a number of the key sectors there is no unemployment. The information communication technologies sectors tell me they have 50 or 60 vacancies. The system has to be faster because people will come from non-EU countries. We want to do that. I hoped we could do without the legislation but it is due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept, given his most recent comment, that the two nations most prominent in visas were Australia and Canada? Other nations from where we want to recruit people are not well represented. More importantly, does he accept that a major obstacle in completing the national roads programme and other infrastructural projects is the difficulty with land? Does the <Col N="958" /> Taoiseach accept the requirement to pay land owners a fair price will be a big obstacle to fulfilling the ambitions laid out in the national roads programme and other infrastructural projects? The imposition of a national indicative price for land is having a disastrous impact on the progress of many road projects, two of which in my constituency will not progress until a more realistic price is paid. Will the Taoiseach accept that no progress will be made unless the money paid allows a farmer to buy replacement land?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Howlin asked me the same question a few weeks ago, and the answer is yes. Progress has to be made as all land is not the same. The NRA, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and the Minister for Finance have tried to rectify the matter; it has to be dealt with. Farm bodies, who I have been meeting on other issues, have raised this issue. I acknowledge there will not be a resolution unless the structure is changed. Solutions have been found in a number of areas, and I am disappointed Wexford is not one of them. I will mention this to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

People in certain countries are now focusing on this country as a place to work, and that will probably extend to other countries. It is important that the system works, as the private sector says it has to go to these countries to get the skilled people it requires. The enormous figure for Australia can be attributed to one or two year visas given to nurses.</P>

      <P>Is there a possibility of amending the roads programme in the national development plan to include Slane bridge? The replacement of that disastrous bridge is not included in the plan despite the fact that 22 people have been killed there. If the NRA tells the Government it wants to bypass Slane with a new bridge, will money be made available? As we cannot put a price on life, would such a request be given favourable consideration, particularly as the <Col N="959" /> Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is from that constituency.</P>
      <P>Three major roads are to be built through the Meath constituency, the N2, N3 and N4, and this will affect a large number of farmers. If the land issue is not dealt with, the roads programme will not go ahead on time. People are being asked to accept one third of the money it would take to replace an acre of land. This is not acceptable and, as my leader said, unless it is dealt with these programmes will take four years longer than necessary to complete.</P>

Does he accept his manifesto, which he mentioned, was high on aspirations which have not been delivered? I draw his attention to the levy on plastic bags.

      <P>For several years it has been normal practice to hold a meeting of the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board during the Taoiseach's visit to the United States over the St. Patrick's Day period. In accordance with this precedent, it is my intention, subject to scheduling constraints, to chair a meeting of the advisory board in Washington on 16 March.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has that meeting been arranged? Is the Taoiseach aware of the concerns of American businesses who have invested in Ireland regarding the Government's abolition of the PRSI ceiling as announced by the Minister for Finance in the last budget, and the additional costs that imposes on American investors? Does he intend to discuss the possible implications for the American firms in Ireland of a slowdown in the US economy? Many of them have already signalled redundancies as they are expecting a slowdown in their domestic economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, a breakfast meeting is set for 16 March. The tradition for the past eight to ten years has been that most people go to the Ireland Fund function, which takes place the night before. Subject to the numbers that arrive, the meeting could take place on that day, or the next day. As far as I am concerned, the meeting is scheduled. I am generally aware of the view of business regarding the PRSI ceiling, which they have held for a number of years. American businesses have had a good tax arrangement for the past few years, although I have not had an undue amount of correspondence with them. I will talk to the chamber of commerce and IBEC on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third matter raised by Deputy Noonan will be on the agenda. As he knows, there is an excel<Col N="961" /> lent group of senior Irish-American individuals who will let us know how corporate Irish-America feels about the situation, including what they think about companies in which they have invested in Ireland. I look forward to hearing the views of the Irish America Economic Advisory Board, as it has helped successive Governments for almost ten years and has been extremely helpful in many areas, ranging from IT, chemical and pharmaceutical industries to banking and the IFSC. It is an extremely useful sounding board for Ireland. I will take up that and other issues with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it was exceptionally unfortunate timing that the PRSI ceiling was removed just when the slow down occurred in the United States, which led to the spate of announcements of redundancies in American owned factories in Ireland since Christmas? Will he instruct the Minister for Finance to drop the PRSI proposal in the Finance Bill, which will shortly go into committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with that. Our corporate industries, particularly the ones to which the Deputy refers, are high earners and are doing remarkably well due to our tax system and far better than they would in practically all other countries. While they have lobbied and argued for some other areas of PRSI changes in years to come, the take from our corporate companies is by no means anywhere near the medium line of what industry would be prepared to pay. I will not change from that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the recent international consultants report which suggests some of the profits attributed to American companies in Ireland could be due to tax avoidance plans by individual Americans? Will he raise that issue at the proposed breakfast meeting, if he is aware of it? If he is not aware of it, will he brief himself on the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>I have not seen the recent report, but I have been aware of suggestions and issues put forward over the years and issues that have been raised by others about some of our IFSC practices. I will consider that. On examination of most of these allegations over the years, I found them not to be true. A high degree of scare mongering by others outside this country takes place regarding activities in the IFSC, but on closer analysis they are totally unfounded.</P>

      <P>However, Rosemary's case also raises wider issues of concern to her family, the public and the international community. For this reason, after meeting Rosemary's family, I called for an independent, judicial public inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding her death.</P>

      <P>In the context of what currently appears to be an impasse, if not considerable difficulties, in Northern Ireland, will the Taoiseach accept that some favourable indication from the British authorities to the effect that they would be prepared to provide for further in-depth inquiries of one kind or another &ndash; without wishing to prejudice what that form might be &ndash; into the three outstanding issues of concern, that have been expressed as such, would unlock a situation where Sinn Féin would be asked to indicate whether it wants to find an acceptable form of policing in Northern Ireland? Will the Taoiseach agree some people would argue that perhaps Sinn Féin is hiding behind these and other issues, specifically the issue of decommissioning, and failing to come forward and clearly indicate it is prepared to make progress on policing by bringing up these issues? If those issues were satisfactorily resolved by the British Government, progress could be made on an issue that is causing difficulty in relation to the four outstanding items?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I would not agree with everything the Deputy said, but it is a fair analysis. The SDLP, in particular, has argued long and hard for those inquiries. It has made good cases <Col N="963" /> that the Finucane, Hamill and Nelson cases should be dealt with. We have lobbied and worked with the human rights and civil rights groups along with the SDLP. The SDLP put a formula to the British Government in the round of talks which effectively have come to conclusion. Absolute clarity on those issues would be a help. I will raise those issues again tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The SDLP has given the lead in this area. All of us in this House who support the position it has had over many years would welcome some indication from the British authorities that these matters could be resolved within a framework that did not prejudice the outcome of any tribunal of inquiry or other form of inquiry that might arise, but would enable progress to be made. I ask the Taoiseach to convey strongly to the Prime Minister Mr. Blair that this is the view of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will. That is an appropriate measure. I do not want to take from the work of Deputy Chief Constable, Colin Port. He is doing an excellent job. Since Rosemary Nelson's death in the run up to St. Patrick's Day two years ago, I have given the report a fair wind and stayed away from calling for an investigation, as I believed that was only proper. I am aware from talking to the family, human rights, civil rights groups and others, that they believe he is doing a good job. As Deputy Quinn stated, there is a difficulty linked to the policing issue, where some would consider these cases would be covered by the policing situation and they could not go back to them. That is a fundamental difficulty and a real obstacle, particularly for the SDLP, in regard to where it could move and that it could not go back to these cases. It is similar to some of the cases we have here relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. Irrespective of however far we can get on those, they will not go away. It is not that there are not hundreds of other cases, which there are. When we talk about these issues here, I am conscious of the letters I get from people stating I forgot this or that case. I am sure none of us wishes to forget any case, but these are viewed by the broader Nationalist community of all parts of Northern Ireland and I am sure southern Ireland as cases that must be dealt with and it is difficult for people to cross the line without a clear mechanism that ensures they would be dealt with properly in future. I will convey that point from the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the information he has given us on the Rosemary Nelson case. Is he aware the President of Sinn Féin, Mr. Gerry Adams, said this morning that achieving a police force, to which Nationalist and republicans could sign up, was becoming the key to opening up the other disputed issues, demilitarisation and decommissioning? Is he aware that Mr. Adams has also said that he believes such an <Col N="964" /> agreement could still be brokered if the British Government acts quickly. As a consequence of that, does the Taoiseach believe his meeting with Mr. Blair this evening could lead to round table talks later in the week that could remove the barriers that still exist to agreement on policing in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the stated position of Gerry Adams and the leadership of Sinn Féin. While there are some outstanding issues, these days I prefer to put it that it would be helpful if we could build a little further on the enormous progress that has been made, including the issue we have been debating, as enormous progress has been made. If there was a willingness on the part of all the parties, including Sinn Féin, and if some of the matters of concern to the SDLP were dealt with, it would be possible to address all the questions. There is a link between demilitarisation and decommissioning. Most of us have nothing to offer with regard to decommissioning, but if it is part of the equation, progress can be made on the other issues. The formula which has been proposed for some time is not altogether unreasonable in terms of making progress. I do not suggest that it is a perfect formula, but it has moved a long way from the position prior to Christmas. I hope we will be able to engage further on these issues tonight. I would like some of the groups mentioned by Deputy Noonan to give some leeway to everybody else to enable moves to be made.</P>

      <P>An imminent breakthrough is unlikely. The policing issue has been brought a long way forward and the parties are aware of what is on offer. I readily admit that it is not enough, but it is an enormous way forward. It might be possible to move a little further on those issues. However, to do so, we need to know the parties' &ndash; I am not referring to the Governments &ndash; understanding of how they would then proceed in relation to decommissioning which is linked directly to demilitarisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Noonan and Quinn have always been supportive on this matter. The difficulty is, however, that those two issues involve two armies. Admittedly, they are different armies, but to enable progress to be made on decommissioning, certain people need to indicate their moves and there must be a move on demilitaris<Col N="965" /> ation. Until that is possible, it is difficult for me to endlessly press for more concessions.</P>

I am willing to participate in such talks one way or another, but people need to know that others are prepared to make some more moves.

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the recent media reports highlighting the potential for abuse in intercountry adoption and the difficulty of regulation in this area, I am sure the Deputy does not mean to suggest that the procedures in this country need to be relaxed. The detailed assessment of prospective adopters prior to their making arrangements to adopt abroad is recognised internationally as best practice and is one of the minimum standards set down in the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in relation to intercountry adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am, as I have stated in the past, more than willing to assist prospective adopters in their wish to adopt abroad, the paramount interests of children must be the guiding principle in this area and our laws and guidelines need to be tight to protect them. The Deputy should also be aware <Col N="967" /> that a comprehensive review of assessment procedures for intercountry adoption was undertaken in 1998 and the bulk of its recommendations have been implemented by the health boards. These included the provision of a new guide for practitioners on the assessment process prepared by the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering &ndash; BAAF &ndash; which are the international leaders in the field.</P>
    <P>Following a variety of initiatives and despite continuing increases in demand, waiting times and the duration of assessment have reduced in almost all health board areas. As a support to prospective adoptive parents, a number of information booklets have been introduced, covering aspects of the application and assessment process as well as information on a number of specific countries. It is planned to keep these up to date and to add to them. These booklets have been widely welcomed by parents.</P>
    <P>Regarding difficulties being experienced by prospective adopters in processing adoptions abroad, my office and the Adoption Board are more than willing to assist in putting forward the case of Irish adopters to foreign authorities where appropriate and have done so on a number of occasions. At a recent special commission on the operation of the Hague Convention, my officials took the opportunity to speak to the delegates of a number of sending countries to assure them of the rigour of our assessment procedure and of our bona fides in respect of the rights of children who may be available for adoption abroad. This is an extremely complex issue. The approach being taken, however, in the current procedures is appropriate in ensuring prospective Irish adopters are considered well prepared and suitable for the task of parenting a child from abroad.</P>
    <P>The release of children from their countries of origin will always be the prerogative of sending countries, rightly so.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>Our priority is to bring forward the legislation to ratify the Hague Convention as soon as possible to strengthen existing provisions in law and to ensure sending countries, which have ratified the convention, are prepared to consider Irish prospective adopters in seeking families for children outside their state. I am pleased to state that I will be bringing the heads of Bill on this important issue to Government shortly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="968" />
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if the Minister of State was aware of that point. In the first quarter of last year, over 100 people joined the list for the adoption of foreign children. Tens of thousands of foreign children are awaiting adoption. There are hundreds of good, eligible parents in Ireland, some of whom have adopted foreign children already, but they must undergo the whole process again for their second adoption. They are being put through an unnecessary bureaucratic process and unnecessary delay in relation to the adoption. Given the need to ensure the people concerned are good adoptive parents and that children find good homes, will the Minister of State ensure this matter is dealt with more compassionately, less bureaucratically and with more humanity? It is fine for those of us who have children. We should think of those who do not have children. They should not be put through unnecessary bureaucratic delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astounded at the attitude of Deputy Mitchell, in saying that it is all about bureaucracy. It is about ensuring that parents who wish to adopt children from abroad are suitable to do so. It is not solely about the parents but it must be in the best interests of the child. We must be in a position to assure any sending country that our procedures are rigorous, that we can stand over them and that these parents have an order of suitability to adopt.</P>
      <P>That said, great improvements have been made in the system. The investment over the three years has totalled £1.5 million, half of which has gone to the eastern area. I recognise that there is a huge increase in the number of people who wish to adopt from abroad.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell's figures are quite wrong. Last year there were, in fact, 788 extra couples who applied to join, 370 of whom were in the east. Naturally it is my intention and my policy&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to assure all of those people, of our assistance in their work by investment, by giving extra staff for the social workers who carry out those assessments. In 1998, in the east alone there were only 5.5 social workers doing this work but there are now 14 doing it. There is funding for 20, but it is difficult to get full-time, part-time or even sessional social workers to do the work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have gone as far as South Africa and Australia to recruit. We also have set in place new procedures, which means that the procedure is now standardised throughout the country, which can ensure that the system is more streamlined and that each social worker is able to take more cases. What we simply must do in all cases is to assure the sending country that the parents, whom we ratify as having an order of <Col N="969" /> suitability to adopt, are suitable and that it would be in the best interests of the child that he or she would be placed in this home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says my figures are wrong. I said that in one health board area alone 100 parents applied in the first quarter last year. My figures are quite correct. I received my figures from people who are involved in this.</P>
      <P>The Minister says we must be careful about how we go about this. I agree with all of that, but the problem is we do not have enough social workers. That is because the Minister of State is failing in her job. It is all right for those of us in this House who have children of our own, but to come in here and read out Civil Service bureaucratic replies of that kind affects the right of children to be adopted and the right of parents to adopt those children.</P>

      <P>The matter raised by the Deputy is an important and sensitive one and is being handled accordingly by the North Eastern Health Board which has statutory responsibility for the management of services at the hospital to which she referred.</P>
      <P>The North Eastern Health Board notified my Department immediately when this issue first came to light and I have been kept fully informed of developments since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board took immediate steps to deal with the situation as soon as he became aware of <Col N="970" /> it and the board initiated a review which was carried out by experts nominated by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The report of the review group has been referred by the board to the Medical Council in the context of its statutory functions as set out in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.</P>
    <P>I went to Drogheda last July and met many of the women involved and heard their experiences at first hand. The meeting was organised by Patient Focus. I had a further meeting with a group representing the women involved on Tuesday, 24 October 2000. I indicated at that meeting that I felt it would be better to await the outcome of the Medical Council's deliberations before deciding on any further action that might be required in this case.

      <P>Would the Minister accept that what we are talking about here is an extremely serious matter? The issue relates to what can only be described as systematic unnecessary mutilation of women of child-bearing age. There may be as many as 90 women who had this experience and certainly the practice went back at least 21 years. Would the Minister accept that while we all understand that the health board acted swiftly once it was notified, the reality is that this practice was continuing, in effect, practically on a daily basis and yet nobody blew the whistle until two young nurses could take it no longer? As the Minister responsible for the management and care of patients, surely his duty must be to ensure, first, that it will not happen again to any patient but, second, that the truth be told.</P>
      <P>Would he accept that it is not solely the responsibility of the Medical Council? The Medical Council has statutory responsibility in terms of professional practice and it is proceeding on that basis relating to one professional, but we are talking about a hospital which failed its patients and about a system which destroyed the possibility for many women to bear more children.</P>
      <P>It is an extremely serious situation. Surely the Minister would recognise that he must make a commitment now that the truth will be told, that there will be a tribunal of inquiry and that there will be an assessment carried out of the history of these women. As Minister for Health and Children, he also has a duty to set in place systems throughout the country to monitor and assess what consultants are doing. We can no longer accept that somehow a consultant cannot make a mistake, cannot become mentally ill, and cannot do things which are unacceptable and which are a danger to his patient in all cases. This has implications for the entire hospital system.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that this is a particularly serious issue and episode. As evidence of my earnestness in this matter and how <Col N="971" /> seriously I regarded it, I took the step to go and meet the women concerned. Clearly the conclusions of the review group of a number of experts from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists give even further rise for concern, namely that 46% of the hysterectomy cases were unacceptable, that a further 12% were doubtful, etc. It also concluded that the protocols and procedures within the hospital were not acceptable and were not on a par with what one would expect across the system, and that the level of interaction and intra-action between the maternity unit of that hospital at the time and the remainder of the hospital was very poor almost to the point of non-existence. Therefore I agree that there are a range of issues which relate to the hospital as well as to the particular individual.</P>
      <P>I sought some indication from the Medical Council as to the time frame for its deliberations. My understanding was that it hoped to be in a position to conclude either around the end of February or later, but that is a matter for the Medical Council &ndash; we have no control over that.</P>
      <P>I am not ruling out an inquiry. I do not want to prejudge the content of that inquiry or make remarks which might appear to prejudge it. I formed a judgment at the time that before I proceed further it seemed logical to wait for the deliberations of the Medical Council which could inform any further action to be taken on this issue.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to outline his view. He must have some idea of what he intends to do following the completion of the Medical Council's work.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council is assessing the fitness of one doctor. The Minister is responsible for the correct management of the hospitals. Surely he has a duty to outline how in intends to deal with the individual cases, even if it is only a general outline in terms of their needs. I appreciate that work has been done by the health board and everybody recognises that, but more must be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no crisis facing general practice. There is a need to address a number of serious infrastructural issues in general practice, including, its fragmented organisation, coupled with the growing volume and complexity of general practice work load, in order that its future development can be charted in a manner that maximises the contribution it can make to the overall health services.</P>
      <P>This is all on the basis of a fundamental recognition that the health care system of the future will be characterised by greater integration and the maximisation of the contribution of component parts through better linkages, rising public expectations, increasing demands for additional health care services, especially of a screening or preventative type, and an increased focus on value for money from public expenditure. In that scenario, a more comprehensive and rationally developed general practice and primary care system should and can play a central role. To do so, it must be properly organised and resourced. It was in recognition of this that health board chief executive officers, with significant input from my Department, initiated a wide-ranging review of general practice.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the review was to identify the measures necessary to meet the challenges posed if general practice were to be properly developed. That review has been completed and its findings are intended to serve as the basis for the future strategic development of general practice. I intend to obtain the agreement of Government to begin the process of moving forward in this area in a structured, logical manner and through a partnership process. An important aspect will be a wide-ranging consultative exercise with the representative bodies, especially the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners which have produced a vision statement for the future. That jointly prepared document will feature as part of the consultative process referred to.</P>
      <P>I look forward to a positive engagement with all concerned. Independently of the review, I am already addressing a number of issues of concern to general practitioners, their patients and the public, such as the provision of an appropriate out of hours general practitioner service. Pilot models are in place in two health board areas and funding will be made available this year to help all health boards develop out of hours GP services. After an evaluation, that process will continue. GPs will benefit in terms of workload commitments from these initiatives and I hope the positive support demonstrated by them for the out of hours projects will be manifest again in the broader strategic developments of the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister might well be known as the Minister for Heinz rather than for Health and Children because he has 57 varieties of inquiries, consultative processes, fora, commissions and committees. How can he say general practice does not face a crisis when the IMO has threatened to withdraw from child vaccination schemes and from serving new medical card patients from 15 March next? Is the Minister aware that the IMO was so upset by the letter sent to it by the Health Service Employment Agency which was dismissive of GPs' needs that it has given rise to the possibility of the collapse of the medical card scheme? When the poorest people go without a medical card, they go without treatment. Given that these measures are threatened and that new medical card holders will not be accepted from 15 March on unless some movement is made, how can the Minister not accept there is a crisis in general practice? There is a serious crisis which he should have anticipated and dealt with given the resources the House has provided for him. What is his explanation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Industrial relations issues do not constitute a crisis in general practice. Some of threats were unwarranted and should not have been made. Industrial relations are a two way process. I am available for discussions. I had arranged a meeting with the IMO which, for logistical reasons, it could not attend. It has met the HSEA. While I have endeavoured to meet the IMO, we had negotiations last year and the IMO president thanked me then for the constructive approach I adopted in the resolution of the issue of fees for the immunisation campaign. Through an independent arbitrator, we substantially increased the immunisation fees for a number of programmes from £89 to £128 per injection.</P>
      <P>Those were issues from last year. Newer issues must be dealt with this year. The position concerning those over 70 is grossly overstated. Approximately 1.2 million people are in the general medical service. It was already agreed under the programme for Government that the eligibility threshold for all those over 70 would be doubled and the final phase of that was to apply in March, which would have added about 5% or an additional 25,000 people over 70. Some extreme comments have been made about those additional 25,000, a number which amounts to 14 additional patients on average per general practitioner or 2% of the overall number on the medical card scheme. That, along with other issues, is not a basis to threaten to withdraw from the overall immunisation programme.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree the level of uptake in vaccinations for children is less than 80% and that 90% of GP practices do not have any equipment to deal with a vaccination which goes wrong, for example? Is it not time for the State to take the pressure off secondary care by giving GPs the incentive to invest in the <Col N="974" /> development of their surgeries and practices so that primary care becomes a place of first call?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have invested heavily in GP practices. We pay a substantial allowance for secretaries in practices. The issue of equipment is still under discussion although much of the basic equipment should be in GP practices in any event. Nonetheless, I am still willing to discuss that issue with them. We continue to invest in the out of hours practice and so forth. There has been ongoing investment. We accept the need for greater strategic development of the service and we are prepared to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to 1987 there were no provisions for the statutory control of the conduct of clinical trials. Following the establishment of the National Drugs Advisory Board in 1966, a voluntary scheme was introduced with the agreement of the pharmaceutical industry and the medical and pharmaceutical professions. This scheme involved applications to the National Drugs Advisory Board and letters of no objection from the board in respect of the proposed trials. This informal scheme, which did not have a statutory backing, continued until the coming into force of the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987. On the basis of the annual reports published by the National Drugs Advisory Board, it has been estimated that approximately 2,022 letters of no objection were issued by the board for the period 1966 to 1988 in respect of applications to conduct clinical trials in this country.</P>
      <P>The Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987, imposed strict regulatory controls on the conducting of clinical trials in this country. Under this Act, which was amended in 1990, persons were required to make application to the Minister for Health and Children for permission to conduct clinical trials. These permissions were granted on the recommendation of the National Drugs Advisory Board. On the coming into force of the Irish Medicines Board Act, 1995, in January 1996, the Irish Medicines Board became the competent authority for the granting of such permissions. Approximately 1,900 permissions to conduct clinical trials, including trials in psychiatric institutions, were granted in the period 1989 to 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> Neither the National Drugs Advisory Board nor the Irish Medicines Board hold specific records in regard to psychiatric institutions. Accordingly, the number of trials carried out in psychiatric institutions is not available without retrieving all the files and going through them in considerable detail. However, the IMB is compiling data concerning clinical trials which were previously requested by the Deputy and these will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as they are available. However, this procedure may not provide reliable or meaningful data as permissions may have been granted for trials which did not subsequently take place. This would also be the case where the number of participants involved in trials is concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>Since the coming into force of the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987 to 1990, it is required that informed consent be obtained from all persons participating in the trials. For the purpose of ensuring the consent is valid, the Act requires that the consent must be given in writing and signed by the person who is to be the participant in the trial, the person consenting is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent, and the consent is obtained by or on behalf of the person conducting the trial.</P>
    <P>The Act also requires that the person conducting a trial shall ensure that before giving his consent every person is made aware of the following matters: the objectives of the trial, the manner in which the substance or preparation is proposed to be administered, the risks and any discomfort involved in and the possible side effects of the trial, and whether the trial will involve the administration of placebos. The consent must be given in writing and signed by the person who is to be the participant.</P>
    <P>On the Deputy's concern about psychiatric patients, I assure him that special provisions apply under the Act in the case of patients who, for practical and other reasons, are unable to give their written and signed consent. These provisions state that, where the patient is capable of comprehending the significance of his consent, he can give his consent to the doctor treating him for that illness in any other manner provided it is clearly given and in the presence of two witnesses who are present at the same time. In such cases the consent must be expressed in writing and be attested by the signature of the two witnesses. Where the patient is incapable of comprehending the significance of the consent to be given, he can participate in the trial only if written and signed consent to such participation is obtained from a person, or persons, who in the opinion of the ethics committee is or are competent to give such consent on his behalf. Such a person or persons must be independent of the person arranging to conduct the trial and of the doctor or dentist conducting the trial. It should be noted that in both these instances it is not permissible to conduct a <Col N="976" /> clinical trial unless the substance or preparation under trial is to be administered for the purpose of saving the life of the patient, restoring his health, alleviating his condition or relieving his suffering. These safeguards were specifically provided to protect the interests of all patients, especially those with a mental illness.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has raised this issue on a number of occasions and I have explained the rigorous process provided for obtaining consent under the Control of Clinical Trials Act. The Deputy should be aware that the raising of these matters has caused some concerns to former patients of psychiatric institutions and their relatives and I am anxious that any unnecessary concerns should be allayed. Therefore, if the Deputy has specific concerns about an individual case or individual areas, I would be grateful if he could provide me with the details so that any necessary investigation can be carried out without further delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his limited reply. I have sought this information since early December last when he promised the various institutions would forward me the information. While clinical trials in orphanages in the 1950s are rightly being examined, I am surprised there is a lack of full information on trials which took place in psychiatric institutions. Does the Minister agree this indicates our attitude to psychiatric patients then and until now? Can he confirm for all trials dating back to the 1950s that fully informed written consent was obtained from each patient every time a clinical trial was conducted on him or her? Are those forms available for inspection? It is necessary that we allay the fears expressed about conducting clinical trials on psychiatric patients without their being fully informed of what was taking place. Would the Minister further agree that if fully informed consent was not received, that was akin to an abuse of the person's bodily integrity? It was physical abuse on the basis that clinical trials, by their nature, test the positive or negative effects of the drug.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot confirm that because I have not read through all the files. The INB is currently checking its files. It is unreasonable to ask that I give a guarantee on that matter on the floor of the House today given that I have not read all the files.</P>
      <P>If consent was not sought that would be in clear contravention of the Act. This House decided in 1987, in its wisdom, to put protocols and procedures for conducting clinical trials on a statutory footing. Obviously clinical trials in conventional medicine and mental illness treatment were envisaged at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listed, in my full answer, the protocols necessary before a person could take part in a clinical trial. The Deputy will be aware of them from previous replies. In other words, specific extra consent provisions were included in the Act to cover patients who, for practical and other reasons, <Col N="977" /> were unable to give their written and signed consent. A patient who was capable of comprehending the significance of his consent could give his consent to a doctor treating him for that illness in any other manner provided such consent is clearly given in the presence of two witnesses. In such cases the consent must be expressed in writing and be attested by the signature of the two witnesses. Where the patient is incapable of comprehending the significance of the consent to be given, he can only participate in the trial if written and signed consent for such participation is obtained from a person or persons who, in the opinion of the ethics committee, is competent to give such consent on his behalf. Such a person or persons must be independent of the person arranging to conduct the trial and of the doctor or dentist conducting the trial.</P>
    <P>The Act lays down very stringent controls in this area.</P>

      <P>The 1996 annual report from the national intellectual disability database indicated that of the 970 persons with an intellectual disability accommodated in psychiatric hospitals, 310 persons required alternative placements. The 1999 annual report indicated that of the 854 persons resident in psychiatric hospitals in April 1999, 493 needed to transfer to the intellectual disability services. The 1999 figures reflect both the ongoing transfer programme and the assessment of need review process which is part of the work associated with the intellectual disability database.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is working with the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to provide alternative accommodation and services for this group and a programme of refurbishment in respect of accommodation which will continue to be used in the short to medium term. Twenty-nine persons from St. Finan's hospital, <Col N="978" /> Killarney, recently moved into new purpose built accommodation and a further 87 persons in other health board areas will also move to similar facilities over the coming months. By the end of 2002, purpose built facilities for a further 87 persons, which are at an advanced stage of planning, will also have come on stream. This is over and above the provision which has and continues to be made for smaller groups of between four to six persons in community-based group homes.</P>
    <P>My Department has requested an update on the numbers currently in psychiatric hospitals and the plans which the boards have in place to meet the needs which have been identified for this group. While this information has not yet been received from all of the health boards, it is clear that the numbers of persons with an intellectual disability in psychiatric hospitals is steadily declining and it is estimated that the current number will be between 650 and 680. I will inform the Deputy of the up to date position as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that a very high number of people accommodated in psychiatric homes should not be there &ndash; according to the inspector's report &ndash; and that were these people not people with intellectual disability there would be absolute uproar? Would he accept the criticism made by the inspector that those with intellectual disability confined to psychiatric hospitals should be separated from psychiatric patients suffering from psychotic disorders? I am referring to the inspector's most recent report. Will the Minister guarantee that that separation can take place during the inevitable wait for the building of the new unit? Will he ensure these people are given some recognition of their status within hospitals?</P>
      <P>As this matter has been raised time and again by the inspector who says he takes a very serious view of it and finds it totally unacceptable, will the Minister provide us with a target for ensuring all these people are relocated? He has been given the message often enough. Does he believe the inspector means what he says when he makes these absolutely damning comments in report after report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the situation is unacceptable and has been for a long time. This Government has been the first to make available huge resources to deal with this matter, in terms of dramatic increases in funding. This is an area which required funding in the first instance to provide new appropriate residential and day care facilities for people with intellectual disabilities. Such people should not have been placed in psychiatric hospitals in the first instance. That they were is clearly a failure of society in the past. We have put in place a programme to systematically eliminate that practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intellectual disability database provides us with a very good basis for doing so in a programmed manner. My predecessor, Deputy <Col N="979" /> Cowen, allocated very substantial funding to this area. I have continued with the same level of funding this year.</P>

      <P>To respond to Deputy Boylan, we have improved significantly the diagnostic process for children with a mental handicap. The pic<Col N="980" /> ture is broader in relation to children with autism. There is a shortage of psychologists and paramedics in many areas.

Autism, which has been examined as part of the psychiatric model, needs to be examined in a broader way as part of a multidisciplinary model. I am proceeding to invite proposals on that basis.</P>
      <P>To respond to Deputy McManus, I would like to set a target whereby all new placements will be available within a five year timeframe. One would like to be in a position to do this within a tighter timeframe of four years, but it is my advice that it will probably be five years before all the buildings required are in place. I am not in a position, therefore, to give any guarantees today due to the logistical issues involved. The direction we have given is that there should be a separation of treatment for those with an intellectual disability in psychiatric institutions. This is happening in a number of places.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to a report from the Eastern Regional Health Authority showing that as much as 22% of theatre time in hospitals in that region is not being used, largely as a result of staff shortages; the steps being taken to ensure the optimum use of all theatre facilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, that the report referred to by the Deputy was completed in April 2000. Actual theatre utilisation was compared with that achievable if theatres were operated for five full days per week.</P>
      <P>The main reason cited for lost theatre time was the shortage of trained personnel, particularly theatre nurses. Other factors which can give rise to under-utilisation of theatres include seasonal pressures which may lead to an increase in acute medical admissions at the expense of elective surgery and capacity constraints in other areas of the hospital, for example, ward accommodation and intensive care unit, ICU, facilities, leading to the unavailability of beds where patients can be transferred post &ndash; operatively. It should be recognised, however, that a number of hospitals have in recent years achieved significant productivity gains in the utilisation of available theatres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The theatre utilisation survey formed an important element of the wider analysis undertaken by the ERHA of capacity constraints within acute hospitals. Underpinning this analysis has been a whole system approach which recognises the fact that service pressures in certain parts of the acute and non-acute sectors can give rise to difficulties in appropriately utilising existing capacity. This approach is essential in tar<Col N="981" /> geting investment in order to achieve maximum patient benefit and efficiency throughout the continuum of health and social care. This system analysis has been set out by the ERHA in its recently completed bed capacity review. This review will inform the national review of bed capacity which will be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with hospitals throughout the region the ERHA is addressing the management of how theatre time is planned, allocated and utilised by different specialities. The shortage of key hospital staff is being tackled on a number of fronts, including the operation, with good effect, of international recruitment campaigns. The ERHA is continuing to work closely with hospitals and other agencies to retain and recruit key staff. Recent figures available to my Department indicate that the shortages in Beaumont Hospital have reduced to ten from 110 in September 2000. Overall, 750 nurses have been recruited since the commencement of the international recruitment drive. I am informed by the ERHA that the wider factors impacting on theatre utilisation such as the management of acute medical admissions, early discharge planning and improved access to appropriate facilities are also being addressed within the region.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a senior consultant recently stated that surgeons are banging on the doors of theatres out of frustration at not being able to use them and that there is a serious problem as to their use? The report was completed in April 2000. Rather than give us a wide-ranging and not very informative report, will the Minister recognise that it is a clear indictment of the failure of the Government to address the problems in our hospitals? Does he accept that staffing shortages have not been addressed and that blood shortages have, in part, led to the closure of operating theatres? I can cite two hospitals in Galway as examples.</P>

      <P>Enormous efforts have been made in the past 12 months to tackle the issue of nurse shortages through international recruitment, the record increase in the number of placements for trainee nurses, the retention and education initiatives, particularly for theatre nurses in terms of the payment of fees and salary while undergoing courses and so on. If anyone can come up with an idea which we have not tried or pursued in partnership with the Nursing Alliance and others, I would like to hear it. We have left no stone unturned in our efforts to recruit the extra nurses needed due to the decision taken in the early 1990s to reduce the number of nurse training places. It is a problem I inherited and one I have moved to solve. I have also taken unprecedented steps to resolve the junior doctors issue.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that earlier this week a consultant at St. James's hospital resigned from the board of the hospital because he could no longer stand over the mess that was the accident and emergency department? Does he agree that this, taken with the shortage of theatres over which he has presided, is a clear indication that if Mr. Cromien was asked to inquire into his leadership at the Department of Health and Children, he would make the same finding that he made in respect of the Department of Education and Science of incompetent administration?

      <P>I reject the strong party political element of the attacks which bear no relation to the facts and are completely inaccurate. Given that retention has correctly been identified as a key issue, I was the first Minister, in the autumn of last year, to develop new flexible arrangements and a comprehensive back-to-nursing initiative for those on the register to enable them to return to nursing. We have introduced the concept of <Col N="983" /> permanent part-time nursing where after a period of eight hours a nurse becomes entitled to superannuation and so forth. No other Government ever attempted to do this. Working with the Nursing Alliance, I have been keen to introduce family-friendly policies for nurses and provide funding for the implementation of measures to enable nurses follow career paths&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to concerns expressed by consultants that greater use of step down facilities in nursing homes may result in elderly patients not receiving the appropriate level of medical care; the resources he will provide to ensure that all appropriate medical facilities, including rehabilitation facilities, are available in such locations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the winter initiative which was announced in October of last year. This initiative was designed to help alleviate anticipated service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospitals sector over the winter period. Under the initiative, I provided investment funding of £25 million which is being targeted at a number of areas, including the provision of aids and supports for use by older people and the recruitment of more than 40 additional hospital consultants to the hospital system. A key element of this initiative was the provision of funding to contract more than 500 places in private nursing homes. These beds are being contracted for the purpose of providing alternative complementary facilities for patients who have completed the acute phase of their treatment and care in a general hospital and who require short-term care in a more appropriate setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that the continuing care needs of such patients discharged from a general hospital are determined by the appropriate consultant medical team. Consequently, there should be no question of people being discharged prematurely from acute hospital care without access to appropriate follow-up medical care provided, for example, through the general practitioner service. I recognise the need to further develop assess<Col N="985" /> ment and rehabilitation services so that older people receive more effective treatment. More than £200 million has been made available to services for older people over the lifetime of the national development plan and health boards will develop such services as part of the plan. This issue is also being considered as part of the national review of bed capacity in the acute and sub-acute sectors.</P>
    <P>In addition to the initiative I have outlined, the Government has provided considerable additional resources, both capital and revenue, for the development of services for older people. In the budget extra resources have been earmarked to continue this development. More than £10 million has been allocated for 2001 for community-based services, including improvements in the home help service and the further development of home rehabilitation services. This funding will be used to enhance the scope of the home help service to cover more people and to provide more hours for existing clients, to improve community support structures, specifically geared towards the support of older people in their homes as well as providing additional supports for carers. Additional funding has also been provided for voluntary groups who work in partnership with the health boards to provide services for older people.</P>

A person can only be discharged when it is considered by the professionals that he should be discharged on medical grounds and no other grounds. This is an important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not invent the phrase &ldquo;step down facility&rdquo;. I understand that it was invented by the <Col N="986" /> medical community some years ago and is now out of fashion. Officials are being attacked for utilising a phrase which was perhaps invented by the medical community some time ago.

      <P>Confirmation by the authorities in Northern Ireland that they are investigating a suspected case of foot and mouth disease in the locality of Meigh, south Armagh, is of the utmost concern. The veterinary investigations being conducted by the Northern Ireland authorities centre on sheep which came from the Carlisle market in Britain. The outbreak in Devon has been attributed to sheep from this market.</P>
      <P>The farm in Meigh has been under restriction for some time. Earlier today the Northern authorities decided to place an eight kilometre zone around the holding within which all movement of susceptible species is being prohibited. As a precautionary measure, they have also decided to slaughter the sheep in question, reflecting the approach being taken elsewhere in the European Union and following the advice of the standing veterinary committee yesterday to have similar type imported animals slaughtered.</P>
      <P>The Border with Northern Ireland bisects the eight kilometre zone. Accordingly, and in order to complete the protective zone, my Department is putting in place a zone immediately south of the Border in north Louth into and out of which the movement of all animals will be prohibited. The area will then be put under veterinary scrutiny. The necessary order is being prepared and I am arranging for the assistance of the Garda and Army in ensuring that movement restrictions are fully effective.</P>
      <P>The case under investigation in Meigh is not confirmed as a positive case &ndash; it is a suspect case &ndash; and these measures are, therefore, precautionary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are worrying developments. In the course of this morning my Department had a speedy review of the situation and carried out an investigation of existing controls. Arising from this, additional resources are to be deployed to control particular points of access and a number of other actions will also be taken. They reflect the suggestions made here yesterday and at the <Col N="988" /> Oireachtas committee meeting where Deputies, including Deputy Dukes, made some suggestions. There was particular concern in regard to the movement of animals and movement of people and whether they could be minimised further. The additional measures are: prohibition on the movement within the country of all susceptible animals; the cancellation, by agreement with relevant bodies and otherwise, if necessary, of all hunting, fishing, hill walking activity which involves access to and passes through farmlands; an immediate call on all sporting bodies to postpone events, or where this is not possible to ensure that protective measures are in place so that vehicles and spectators undergo disinfection; a further public information campaign <i>via </i>the national media to support last weekend's information campaign.</P>
    <P>The measures necessary to put the foregoing into effect including, where appropriate, the necessary legal instruments are being prepared for me.</P>
    <P>We are into a new and deeply worrying phase of this issue and, just as I have done up to now, I am ruling nothing out when it comes to any further measures that may be necessary as matters unfold.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining the further measures he proposes to take. He will understand I am not simply being curmudgeonly when I say I hope those measures are put fully into effect and that we do not see in them the kind of gaps in implementation that we have talked about in this House for the past week, because every day brings new indications of a vast difference between the intention and the practice on the measures. If it is the case that the main Dublin to Belfast road goes through the prohibition zone that surrounds the farm in question, as I am informed, will the Minister seek to put in place measures to divert traffic? I put it to him that it would be entirely undesirable for traffic to pass through that area given what we know about the way this disease can spread. Since the Minister has confirmed that the sheep on this farm were in the same location in Carlisle as sheep that finally turned up with the disease in Devon, has he any further information on any of the other sheep imported into this country between 1-20 February? The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, indicated yesterday that some 3,000 sheep been imported into this country came from Devon and what progress has been made in locating and slaughtering those sheep? Will the Minister see to it that information is made available to farmers on the symptoms of this disease? Specifically, will he cause to be put on the Department's website information on the symptoms which will be published and given wide publicity? The information contained on the British Ministry of Agriculture's website is clear, comprehensive and, as far as I know, reliable. Will the Minister agree it is extremely worrying to find, even as late as last night, that there is no clear description of the <Col N="989" /> symptoms generally available to farmers and that even farm leaders are not in a position to give a clear description of these symptoms?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for expressing his concern yesterday both here and at the Oireachtas committee meeting. I tried to ensure I took his views into account when drawing up the additional measures. In relation to gaps in the measures, I do not think it is possible to have totally watertight access points. We have put measures in place. We advertised them widely by putting advertisements in the newspapers, including clinical signs, over the weekend. I called on the general public to co-operate fully to seek to ensure this dreaded plague did not come into the country. I reiterate that call for people to co-operate.</P>
      <P>In relation to sheep or any susceptible livestock that may have come into the country since 1 February, we have been in co-operation with the London and Belfast authorities who have a tracking system in place since then. We have established that at least three consignments of sheep came into the country, two to Wexford and one for slaughter in the west. The two in Wexford were put under surveillance straight away after it was established they came from Great Britain and will be slaughtered tomorrow as a precautionary measure. There are no suspects there and it is not a suspect case. The standing veterinary committee of the EU said yesterday if any animals were imported into member states from Britain that, as a precautionary measure, they should be slaughtered. That is being done.</P>
      <P>In relation to the consignment of sheep that went for slaughter to the west, that plant was visited immediately after it had been established and the plant was disinfected and all the staff interviewed. Some 12 members of staff were part-time farmers or had association with farms. Those farms are restricted since it was established that sheep came in from outside the jurisdiction. We are continuing to do everything possible. Where there is scientific advice or where the standing veterinary committee of the EU say that measures should be taken, that is being done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that this farm is almost on the Border, as the Minister has indicated, that it joins the main road and that any eight kilometre exclusion or surveillance zone around the farm would cover the main road. That being the case, will the Minister ensure traffic is diverted because as long as we have a disease of this kind that can be carried in the air, it is clear there is a major risk of transmission <i>via</i> traffic going up and down the main road?</P>

      <P>The information note provided to me says the zone south of the Border is being defined at present. This is being done in conjunction with the Garda. This will involve re-routing traffic from any of the roads that go through the exclusion zone. We have asked the Garda and the Army to assist in that re-routing of traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>We made a number of suggestions to the Minister's officials at the committee last evening, some of which have been taken on board. Will the Minister agree that the virus is very contagious, virulent, airborne and can be transmitted easily by way of transportation and humans? Given that people are a major source of transmission, is it time to consider restricting movement between susceptible zones?</P>
      <P>In the event of a foot and mouth outbreak being identified here, what emergency or contingency plans are in place to deal it? Who would be responsible? That is why I called yesterday evening for a task force to be chaired by the Taoiseach. I am not happy that there is sufficient interdepartmental co-operation to deal with this issue. The Departments involved include Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Taoiseach and Finance. Does the Minister agree the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Tourism, Sport and Recreation should also be involved given that the angling season is now beginning and boats will be arriving in this country? I was contacted this morning by people who are involved in this business. Does the Minister agree the task force should have a wider remit than is currently the case?</P>
      <P>Is there sufficient emergency legislation in place to deal with the crisis? If the movement of people has to be restricted, will that entail emergency legislation given the Supreme Court decision on the right to travel? Does the Minister agree the Taoiseach should lead by example and cancel his proposed visit to Wales tomorrow? I have advised my people not to travel home from England this weekend. We must lead by example. What level of co-operation is in place with the Minister for Agriculture in Northern Ireland? What has taken place to date to restrict the movement of susceptible animals onto the island and across the Border? </P>
      <P>What measures are in place in the Minister's Department to ensure it does not become a risk area for the spread of foot and mouth disease? Is there a disinfectant system in place in Agriculture House which is just 300 metres from here?</P>

      <P>I am asking a question. Is there a disinfectant system in place in Agriculture House from where the example should emanate? Are there disinfectant stations in all Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development offices which are open to the public? Will the Minister encourage farmers to send in documentation and allow them additional time to do so rather than having them visit agricultural offices? Should the same apply to Teagasc offices? Are there sufficient reserves of disinfectant to increase the number of disinfectant units at points of entry to the country?</P>
      <P>In the unfortunate event of a suspected case of foot and mouth disease in this jurisdiction, what steps are in place to ensure testing can take place without delay? Have we a laboratory capable of carrying out these tests or would the tests have to be carried out in Pirbright in England? If not, is the Minister prepared to invest in a well resourced epidemiological unit to test for diseases such as foot and mouth disease? Will the Minister guarantee that the current reserves of disinfectant are sufficient to ensure everyone entering the State from the UK can avail of same?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Penrose asked a number of questions. In relation to the movement of people, we have issued statements and directives and spoken with a number of relevant bodies who have promised to call off to the greatest extent possible various events. This applies to the IRFU in relation to the rugby match, horse race meetings, including point to point, and a range of greyhound race meetings. I have now included hunting, fishing, hill walking and so on. I have also asked Dúchas to cancel all trips to national parks where people might congregate in order to minimise the movement of people. I have asked people publicly to desist from making journeys outside the State, particularly to the UK, unless absolutely necessary. If they must travel, I have asked them to use the hygiene facilities and disinfectant measures available to them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked that the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Tourism, Sport and Recreation be included in the task force. The task force met for the first time this morning and I will be pleased to convey the Deputy's recommendation that these Departments be included.</P>
      <P>On the level of contact with the North, I have spoken on a number of occasions with the Minister, Bríd Rodgers, including today on the suspected case of the disease. The chief veterinary officer and his officials and the chief veterinary officer in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in Dublin are in hourly contact with one another. The same applies to Mr. Scudamore in the UK. There is ongoing co-operation in relation to this crisis.</P>
      <P>On the question of laboratory facilities, there are no testing facilities in this country. Testing is carried out in the UK and this does not cause a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> The Deputy asked if there is an adequate supply of detergent. My information is that there is an adequate supply of detergent. From the beginning, we were in touch with the suppliers and manufacturers of detergents to ensure they increased the supply because there is a huge demand for this. I am addressing all the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is of great concern to everyone in the country. A number of the measures outlined are confined mainly to people who have been in contact with animals and involved in agriculture. How can urban dwellers prevent the spread of this disease? Given that approximately 80% of the population live in large towns and cities, what advice can the Minister give them in terms of their movement and behaviour during this crisis? Would the Minister advise people to restrict unnecessary journeys within the country and how will he communicate this message?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that this crisis affects every citizen in the country. Everyone has a duty to co-operate and be vigilant in regard to this potentially serious matter. Urban dwellers can help by not purchasing uncooked food of any kind such as dairy products and cheeses made from raw milk. There are a number of uncooked or partly cooked meats in which the virus survives. For example, it survives pasteurisation of milk. Any milk coming into the country &ndash; this would affect Border counties more than the south &ndash; should be double pasteurised or ultra high temperature treated. Urban dwellers should check cartons to ensure this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Should the product be on the shelves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The first case was confirmed in the UK on Tuesday last week. The following day we issued a directive to all the retail outlets pointing out the susceptible products and asking that they not be stocked on shelves. Problems may arise where goods are delivered door to door.</P>
      <P>I have asked people not to travel, especially to the UK, unless it is absolutely necessary. If they travel to Great Britain they should not visit farms because that will add to the risk. It will help if people take measures to reduce travelling and contact with farms and farm animals and not purchase uncooked or partly cooked products. People sometimes give crumbs to pet dogs. That is unhelpful and in the public notices we have included this as an activity to avoid . This is an extremely virulent organism. With the best will in the world we must take every possible precaution and this means trying to avoid even the most minimal of risks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the outbreak in Northern Ireland is confirmed will the Minister agree that County Donegal would be especially vulnerable <Col N="993" /> due to the fact that the county has probably the longest land border with Northern Ireland? Can he guarantee that all crossings between County Donegal and other Border counties and Northern Ireland, either approved or unapproved, will be adequately manned to prevent the spread of the disease through either human or animal contact? </P>
      <P>Will the Minister outline the latest measures taken along the Border? Has security been increased? What steps have been taken since this news broke at lunch time? What is being done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Since lunch time we have been in discussions with the Garda and the Army to get their assistance in patrolling the Border roads. We have also enlisted additional resources and staff from my Department, for example, the land project officers and other officers. I have also contacted Teagasc. It has a good number of advisers who can be helpful in policing. The intention is to seal the Border as far as is possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the results of the test on this case, even though the exclusion zone includes a part of north County Louth that will not change the designation of Ireland as disease free. It will not affect our status on this disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>In case anyone misinterpreted my comments yesterday, I confirm that meetings have taken place in Monaghan between the gardaí and the relevant authorities. The DVO and the personnel concerned are making every possible effort in very difficult circumstances. I understand it will be impossible to fully man all the minor Border crossings to ensure they remain closed. Will the Minister take account of the fact that personnel in some of the Border areas close to south County Armagh have asked that security measures be dramatically accelerated? Farm families are in dire fear of the total loss of their businesses. They have put it to me that it does not matter if things are brought to a standstill for a week, ten days or a fortnight.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the need to close roads if necessary? I hate the word &ldquo;close&rdquo; because we have lived with closed roads for too long, but we are dealing with a disastrous situation. Is proper lighting being provided, especially for the main checkpoints? There was a hit and run incident involving one garda and I understand a second was also injured. It has been drawn to my attention that some of the battery powered lamps are not very good, especially as the night goes on. We need to ensure that is properly addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate how many Border roads are there? Deputy McGinley said the County Donegal stretch of the Border was perhaps the longest. The County Monaghan stretch might be slightly longer. The Border along the county is extremely difficult to man. Is the Minister satisfied that the roads are being manned in a satisfactory manner and that personnel on them are properly advised? From my inspection of some of the roads there are big differences <Col N="994" /> between the ways in which some gardaí are carrying out their duties.</P>
    <P>How many Army personnel are involved with the Garda? We have been told how many gardaí have been moved northwards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant. A task force has been established to co-ordinate all the different groups concerned. When I travelled along the Border I did not see any Army involvement. I do not say it is not involved, but in a national emergency we must include everybody necessary. The Army could play no better role than to be present along the Border. Farm organisations, among others, have supplied water and addressed the other issues.</P>
      <P>Have the different sport organisations in the Border area been contacted? I have contacted my county board chairman, Councillor Gary Carville, and he has advised me that discussions are ongoing with a view to cancelling the different games that are scheduled. It is essential this be done properly in the Border region.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister ascertain if the Dundalk-Castleblayney road has been involved in the suspected outbreak? The road is causing serious problems. Last weekend people travelled to Dundalk and on their return they crossed the Border but could not return. A joint approach must be taken to addressing this aspect as it covers the most difficult area.</P>
      <P>I do not know how much of the Border area the Minister has examined, but it is very complex. Has he any proof or otherwise that livestock has been moved illegally along these routes? Today I heard of a case in north County Monaghan where gates were left open and tracks were made at a time when the family concerned was in a hospital.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to ensure the Border area is contained by all the relevant personnel. I appreciate the Minister's comments on the involvement of Teagasc and Department officials. We need them all to be involved. In view of the situation the Fine Gael Party has cancelled its constituency convention in an effort to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's acknowledgement of the role of the DVO and the gardaí in Monaghan. Department personnel, gardaí and everybody directly concerned have been working 17 or 18 hours a day to try and grapple with, and put measures in place to address a problem that was first confirmed in Great Britain a week ago yesterday. From Wednesday of last week, as matters have unfolded, every possible measure has been put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> The Garda are co-operating fully with the Department. As regards Border roads and unapproved roads, the Army has been at the Border for some days and if the Garda say additional Army personnel is required, the Army will provide whatever additional resources are necessary based on the Garda request. Sporting organisations have been totally co-operative and have been extremely helpful. They share everybody's concern about this disease.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about illegal traffic in animals. There is an unfortunate situation here where a very small number of people flout the rules. Members will have seen in the media examples of where people have infected their own herds. People have been prosecuted for tampering with disease control regulations. In the Border area, there is some illicit traffic in animals. The investigation branch in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Garda, the RUC and the authorities in the North of Ireland are working to stamp this out and to ensure, as far as is possible, that it is stamped out but, as the Deputy said, if gates are left open where a farm straddles the Border, it is extremely difficult. That is why everybody's co-operation is absolutely essential in this matter because unscrupulous people will find a loophole somewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether or not we can contain the disease, given the suspected case in Northern Ireland, will the Minister now issue all bodies with an influence on the eventual outcome with ultimate instructions as if the outbreak was in this jurisdiction now so as to deal with a worst case scenario in the first instance and to recognise that whatever measures are taken now will be seen ultimately in terms of their effectiveness or otherwise?</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that he has asked various bodies and agencies, both under the aegis of his Department and otherwise, not to proceed with visits or to go hill walking. Is it not time to issue specific instructions, because it will be too late in two or three days time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning the Taoiseach mentioned the movement of animals to final destinations. Will the Minister look again at what that entails, because the movement of animals to final destinations can also have some serious consequences in certain circumstances? Will he look at those areas, in particular, and at the possibility of segregating the country into cells which can be isolated reasonably effectively? At least we might make a <Col N="996" /> better attempt to control the outbreak than they did in the nearest jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>On the question of encouraging people not to travel, I know some airlines and sea carriers have already indicated their willingness to compensate people in certain circumstances. I hope the Minister will use his influence and that of the Government to encourage carriers to do just that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Durkan asked if we would treat this suspect case as if it was a positive one. The decision taken this morning to prohibit the movement of all susceptible animals is such a response to that because that creates an exclusion zone within our own jurisdiction. The Taoiseach referred to a final destination this morning. A final destination is a slaughterhouse or an abattoir. People who have finished cattle and want them processed take them to a final destination and that will be allowed. We want to stop traffic of animals farm to farm and from one location to another. If farmers have finished animals and they want to take them to slaughter houses, that will be allowed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked that various bodies be directed to cease various activities. We have called in a range of bodies and, in all cases, they have shared our concern and have called off the various events, gatherings and sporting activities. We will continue to do that if any suggestion is made here or elsewhere. I have no difficulty with people saying they have found a loophole or an access point because it should be investigated and attended to straight away. If a range of people are directed to do a particular job, some will do it better than others and some will know their job. I gave an instruction this morning that a standardised set of instructions be sent out to officers everywhere stating what they should do in particular circumstances to close off any small or minute risk and to seek to ensure the area is sealed as far as is humanly possible.</P>

Will the Minister confirm that when apprehended in County Cavan, the driver gave false information about his destination? Has he satisfied himself as to where that lorry travelled in County Cavan?

The most up to date information on this driver is that inquiries are still being made and the driver is awaiting further questioning. In relation to the lorry driver and some activities North and South of the Border, it is extremely difficult to pinpoint and establish exactly where vehicles have been and to where they are going and we are doing this in conjunction with the RUC. At some times, the lorry or vehicle is north of the Border while at others, it is south of the Border. The Garda and our investigation branch are continuing their investigations intensively. I understand that at this point the driver is wanted for additional questioning.</P>

Has the Department traced all of the sheep, pigs and cattle which were imported from the UK between 1 and 20 February?

If they have been destroyed, were they slaughtered? What has happened to the carcases and by-products of these animals &ndash; have they also been destroyed or are they in circulation?

Why are there no disinfection mats at the doors of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development? I have just come from the Department and could not believe there were no mats; neither could the two farmers I met on the way out. Will the Minister instruct all local authorities, tax offices and other public buildings to provide disinfection mats? People go to tax offices throughout the country in droves at the end of the month to renew their car tax. I intend to contact all of the people for whom my business sells houses to ask them to provide disinfection mats at show houses next weekend and I call on the Minister to ask my colleagues throughout the country to do likewise. Last Saturday, hundreds of people from both urban and rural areas visited show houses in my area. We should curtail all public events. Two major events were due to take place the weekend after next in my constituency &ndash; our convention and a function to mark my 25 years in politics&mdash;</P>

It is extremely important that we would be aware of any potential outbreaks.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced that we can curtail the importation of sheep from the UK. We have never been able to do that. I have raised with the Minister on a number of occasions the question of sheep being illegally imported into this country in the dead of night.

      <P>I have already asked people to avoid returning to Ireland to attend St. Patrick's Day parades. In the light of a number of suggestions and recommendations made here, I will undertake to ask parade organisers to cancel the parades as there is a risk, however small, where people congregate in large numbers. The cancellation of the parades will inconvenience and disappoint many people who have put great effort into their organisation but we must reduce risks, where possible.</P>
      <P>A number of people have raised the issue of mats being placed at the entrances to public buildings, including Department buildings. Initially, we sought to ensure that mats and disinfectants were made available at access points to people who travelled to Ireland from abroad as this was the area of highest risk. However, I take the point that wherever people congregate, particularly those from an agricultural background, mats should be available and I will arrange for that to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Connaughton, the Department has been called to a number of specific locations about which there were suspicions. I compliment members of the public on reporting strange or unusual happenings at farms, factories or abattoirs. We do not have reason to believe there is any suspicious case in the country at present. The Deputy's comments about sheep imports were also correct. It is amazing that although there are some eight million sheep in the country which do not command a great price &ndash; a fact for which I have received much of the blame &ndash; sheep continue to be imported. It has proved extremely difficult to control such imports. In my discussions with the social partners, I stated that these imports could be controlled only by tagging individual sheep. This was resisted by the major farming organisations. However, it will have to be done as there is no other way of controlling them. Since the importation ban was imposed, there have been no difficulties because all vehicles carrying sheep are sent back. There has not been a case since the <Col N="1000" /> ban was imposed, but it is those which emerged before it was imposed about which we are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about on-farm visits which are cancelled and if grants are available. I will have inquire about those matters. Administratively, there is a need for accountability. In the case of some on-farm grants the works in question must be completed. I will look at what can be done. On premia and headage payments, a case can be made for paying 60% or 80% of the grant in advance and later reconciling&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Leas-Ceann Comhairle hit the kernel of the matter, inadvertently, when he interjected while Deputy Crawford was asking his question about the number of military personnel involved to state that the Deputy was addressing his question to the wrong Minister. While I appreciate that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is doing all he can, does he agree that the Government as a whole does not appreciate the extent of the problem? There should be several Ministers present. Let me give one simple example. The Minister called on Dúchas to curtail activity. In the national park in Wicklow, which stretches from Enniskerry to Tullow, a distance of 80 miles, there are approximately 1,000 wild goats and, at least, 8,000 wild deer, but up to yesterday it had not received any instructions. Has it been informed? The problem is that many Departments are not playing a role and will close the door only after the horse is gone. What does the Minister have to say about this?</P>

Has the Minister given any consideration to the procedures that could be put in place to restrict the movement of such animals? As the last outbreak of foot and mouth disease was in 1941, what training programmes have been put in place for vets and farmers? Is there an emergency update? As samples have to be sent to the United Kingdom, how long does it take to have a case confirmed?</P>

Is this true and, if so, was the Department aware of it? Will the Minister give details to the Dáil? Why was that allowed to happen given that these animals pose as much of a risk as other animals which have been banned? Is it a question of Coolmore Stud being shown favouritism? Did the Government wait until last night before introducing the ban so as to allow animals to be imported? It has been reported in racing circles that if the Cheltenham racing festival takes place, the horse, Istabraq, will race. Given the incumbent risks this should be deplored by the Minister as it would encourage many to travel to Cheltenham. Will the Minister call on the horse's owner to declare that he will not travel?</P>

      <P>I have sympathy for the Minister, a constituency colleague of mine, but we must be cruel to be kind. This is not a laughing matter. As well as deploying members of the Army and the Garda, the Government should mobilise members of Civil Defence to ensure all roads along the Border are monitored and kept under surveillance. Day-trippers to Holyhead must also be closely policed to ensure the necessary precautions are taken to prevent the spread of the disease. What steps are being taken to deal with the threat posed by letters and packages from Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the many trailers from the North which travel as far south as Bantry in the Minister's constituency approximately once a month at weekends? I was informed by two of the Minister's representatives last night at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine that birds do not carry the disease. I learned this morning, however, that the French are concerned about seagulls. If that is so, we should be concerned about migratory birds which have flown here from England and Scotland because of the recent Arctic conditions, such as the lapwing, golden plover and green plover.

Has he consulted the builders' federation on the importance of this matter? Is he also aware that the message can be got accross simply and effectively on local radio and in the local press? Much time has been lost as a result. Are retail stores being inspected to ensure stock is not on sale? Although instructions have been issued, has the Minister consulted RGDATA which represents retail grocers on this important matter?</P>

Can on-farm REPS inspections be postponed and payments given in trust until retrospective inspections are done?

      <P>Deputy Timmins urged a greater degree of co-ordination between different Departments and different agencies, but we have 100% co-operation at the moment. Many Deputies have called for additional representation on the task force that has been set up, and we will take that into account and make sure it happens. We are arranging for advertisements during the next couple of days, to heighten the awareness of the general public and retailers in the street.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes referred to last week's advertisements as being turgid and technical. We will have them in layman's language as far as that is possible this week, and try to arrange to have them on the front page. Deputy Upton spoke of the need to reduce the risk from rats and hedgehogs on farms and I will talk to veterinary experts in my Department when I return. It must be remembered that while we want to minimise risk, we have not had any confirmed cases in the country yet. We want to do everything possible to keep foot and mouth disease out.</P>
      <P>Deputy Joe Higgins asked about mares coming into the country, as this is the breeding season. As the disease spread in the United Kingdom during the past week, we issued a directive banning all non-susceptible animals, including horses, from coming in to Ireland. No horses have come here since that directive was issued a couple of days ago. No favouritism or selectivity was used, as a number of stud farms receive mares from outside the country. The National Stud takes 60% to 65% of its mares from abroad.</P>
      <P>I do not have an ante-post bet on Istabraq, and I hope many more people do not either. I strongly urge all horse owners, who have put in a great deal of preparation, not to go to Cheltenham or to send their horses. That particularly includes Istabraq. This will be disappointing and inconvenient for everybody. Istabraq has a huge following in Ireland, and many people might go to Cheltenham because he might run there. If the event at Cheltenham takes place, I publicly call on the trainer and owner of Istabraq not to send him there.</P>

      <Col N="1003" /> Deputy Sheehan spoke of enlisting the civil defence, which is a good suggestion, and I will take that up. He also spoke of traders, including those in west Cork in Castletownbere and Bantry. There is still a fair at Bantry, although I do not think there is an animal from one end of the square to the other. However, traders still come many of whom come from as far away as Scotland and the North. They are subject to the same regulations as everybody else, including certification of disinfection. There are not usually any live animals there, and hardware of various kinds and non-food items are sold.</P>

      <P>As far as possible, I have availed of local radio and local media throughout the country. I have particularly tried to do this in Border counties where the problem is concentrated. It is a good medium of communication. REPS inspections have been stopped, but I will look at regulations, accountability and Irish and EU audit requirements to see if advance payments can be made. I hope this problem will not last too long, but if it does I will try to help farmers as they have to survive, and they have been through enough difficulties already.</P>

Will this movement be stopped as it poses a big danger? Has the Minister recruited extra veterinary surgeons and, if so, are they deployed in the Border area?

        <b>: </b>Given that his Department has this afternoon ordered the slaughtering of 1,300 sheep imported from Devon and rumours and innuendoes are sweeping the county, will the Minister make a statement clarifying the position in County Wexford? Can he account for the traceability of the sheep in question? Have they all been rounded up? Have they been in contact with sheep in the locality?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Browne said about the situation in County Wexford, which is a cause of concern. People have become aware of this information, not only in County Wexford but elsewhere in the south east. The Minister should make a statement as soon as possible to clear up the matter. I appreciate that he has a difficult job to do, but farmers are worried. There is no room for a casual approach to the matter. It is clear that there was no emergency plan in place to deal with an outbreak of foot and mouth disease as farmers were unable to obtain disinfectant in many of the branches of <Col N="1005" /> Glanbia in County Kilkenny in order to adhere to the regulations laid down by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I was worried when I heard the Minister say that he had known for one week that a farm in County Armagh was under suspicion. It took him one week to introduce restrictions. I do not know if there are restrictions in place in the rendering plant at which the animals in question were destroyed. That kind of statement does not engender confidence among producers and consumers about the manner in which the issue is being dealt. In spite of the difficult job the Minister has, I ask him to redouble his efforts and those of his staff and to take whatever action is necessary at ports and elsewhere to ensure these issues are dealt with.</P>
      <P>The fact that there are rumours in County Wexford about the sheep imported from Devon is a clear indication that many are worried about this issue. The rumour that 1,300 sheep will be slaughtered has probably led everybody to believe that there is an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in County Wexford. That is the reason it is important to give the public the correct information as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister is wrong to adopt a voluntary code of practice calling on people's goodwill not to travel to Cheltenham. In view of the scale of the crisis, that is not good enough. People must be forced to make decisions by the Department in the national interest.</P>

      <P>Based on local knowledge and contact with my office in County Louth today I understand, given the proximity of the farm in Meigh, approximately four kilometres north of the Border, it is intended to establish an exclusion zone extending across the Border. If the exclusion zone has a radius of six kilometres, it will extend into County Louth. The Cooley Peninsula, which has a significant population of sheep, is in close proximity. Will the exclusion zone embrace all of the Cooley Peninsula which is bounded by the sea on one side and by the Border on the other? It is a mountainous area which, although mainly populated by sheep, is home to a significant number of wild animals, particularly wild deer and wild horses. The hazard posed by wild deer, in particular, is significant given that they are extremely mobile and travel significant distances. This matter needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>In south Armagh and north Louth a significant number deal in sheep and livestock. Has any effort been made to contact these individuals to establish their movements during the past month to six weeks? A number of persons in the area are involved in the transportation of livestock. Their movements also need to be traced.</P>
      <P>Have the official and unofficial abattoirs in the area been identified and contact made with them to establish the number of slaughterings in the past month or so, and, more particularly, identify the locations from where the livestock came?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a unique feature of north Louth, south Armagh and south Down that veterinary prac<Col N="1006" /> titioners criss-cross the Border as part of their practice. Many vets on both sides of the Border visit farms North and South. This poses a serious hazard.</P>
    <P>The children of some farming families north of the Border attend school in Dundalk. At least one parent inquired today if her daughter will be able to attend school in Dundalk if an exclusion zone is established. That matter needs to be addressed. If school children from a farming family north of the Border, particularly in the Forkhill area, travel south to school, there is a need to ensure their movements are checked as a matter of urgently.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon is correct in pointing to the danger posed by the movement of people. There are a number of discos in Dundalk and along the Border at which many young people from the North and South congregate on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights on a regular basis. There is also the shopping phenomenon. With the strength of sterling, hundreds, perhaps thousands, travel south of the Border on a regular basis to shop, Dundalk in particular, where they come in contact with local people in Cooley and north Louth.</P>
    <P>A number of tourism related projects, involving hill walkers and trekkers who regularly frequent the area, have been developed in south Armagh and north Louth. There is an urgent need to talk to those concerned to ensure they do not walk in the area until this matter has been cleared up.</P>
    <P>I heard a speaker in the Seanad make the point that there is a suggestion that some animals from the farm in Meigh in south Armagh may have been brought South. That matter needs to be addressed, as, if true, the implications are obvious and serious. I rest my case.</P>

      <P>The movement of people seems to pose the primary threat in bringing the disease to this country. Does the Minister accept that we have reached the stage where every person travelling from the United Kingdom into Ireland should be required to complete an entry form giving details of the locations from which they have travelled and to which they are travelling, as is the norm when one enters the United States, New Zealand or Australia, to enable officials at airports and seaports to decide which persons need to avail of disinfection treatment? Everything appears to be on a voluntary basis. We are appealing to persons from rural areas who come to this country to go to the Department's offices at airports and seaports. A more pro-active approach should be taken and I ask the Minister to take this suggestion on board. There is no reason that people flying or sailing by ferry to Ireland should not have to fill out a small form giving details of where they are coming from, to where they are going and how long they plan to stay in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the investigation taking place in Armagh, I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong but I understand 20 sheep will be <Col N="1007" /> destroyed on a farm. These animals came from England as part of a batch of 200 sheep.

At the meeting of the standing veterinary committee yesterday, a decision was taken to advise member states that in such cases, even in the absence of suspicion, susceptibility or clinical signs, the animals should be slaughtered as a precautionary measure. This will happen tomorrow, but there is no suspicion in relation to those sheep. They are being slaughtered as an ultra precautionary measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my information. Deputy Stanton referred to the GAA and the need to ensure that it co-operates. The organisation is co-operating in every possible way. If it holds matches, it must have adequate and comprehen<Col N="1008" /> sive disinfectant facilities at venues. I again urge all organisations and public bodies to cancel activities where people congregate.</P>

      <P>No, but it is essential to take precautions at places where people congregate, especially in Border areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated that on many occasions, and I have asked relevant bodies to cancel events at which people would gather. If that involves religious ceremonies or other events, that should be done. I will take on board the point about the FCA and consider if it can be used. The Army is available. When the Garda Síochána recommend that additional personnel should be used, the Army is available.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan asked about the Crufts dog show. The same position applies to non-susceptible animals. We have advised people not to bring animals into or take them out of the country. The Irish Kennel Club was to hold a dog show at the RDS on St. Patrick's Day. We spoke to representatives of the organisation and asked them to cancel the event. It would be desirable for people to do the same in relation to the Crufts show.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is the same at that applying to non-susceptible species. Any traffic in these animals is a risk which should not be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know how matters will develop between now and the Crufts dog show. However, there is every possibility that the animals will not be allowed back in and I am asking people not to take dogs to the Crufts dog show and not to attend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelleher asked about hay and straw. The transport and importation of hay and straw is not allowed. The Deputy also said an information leaflet about the disease should be widely circulated. A number of Members referred to the clinical signs of the disease and information that would be important in that regard. Such a leaflet <Col N="1009" /> is being prepared and will be made widely available.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon raised a number of matters, including discos. In the main, most people are responsible. However, a small number take risks and, in some cases, deliberately flout the regulations. Deputy Browne raised the case of a farmer in Wexford. As I said earlier, there is no problem with those sheep. They are not susceptible or showing any signs of the disease. However, in view of the recommendation of the standing veterinary committee, they will be slaughtered tomorrow. The Deputy also asked if the Army could be used in Rosslare. I will consider that suggestion and if it is recommended by the scientific experts, I will ensure it happens.</P>
    <P>In relation to ensuring people can be tracked and traced, Deputy Coveney said we should insist that people fill out entry forms. I will consider his suggestion. This is an emergency and that might add to the effort to establish where people might be or from where they have come. It would be helpful and it is a good suggestion. Regarding the Deputy's other point, a total of 26 sheep are involved. Given the Border and the fact that it involves another jurisdiction, we are working hand in hand with the veterinary authorities and the RUC in the North and our investigation unit to try to get a clear picture. Those investigations are ongoing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey raised the issue of people who purchased airline tickets to enable them attend the match in Cardiff. He said that at least one airline is insisting on retaining the value of those tickets. I have asked the Department of Public Enterprise to examine this matter and I understand it is pursuing it with the airline in question.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Kitt asked about workers that go through farm land and farms in the preparation of pipelines. We have been in discussion with Bord Gáis and it is scaling down its activity. In any place where there is commonage and farm, it is seeking to stop that activity while there is an emergency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that we would not be able to unscramble the egg, and that if there is one case of foot and mouth disease, it would be a catastrophe for the country. Therefore, would he also agree that he should forget the softly, softly hit-and-miss approach to appeals to everybody to act sensibly in the national interest? Is it not time to be more direct and issue mandatory directions to restrict people moving within and without the State? It would be difficult and inconvenient but it is necessary. Yesterday when we said this here, some people almost guffawed. The time has come. Tomorrow might be too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> Is there a contingency or emergency plan in place, in the unfortunate and, I hope, unlikely event, that one case of foot and mouth disease is established? What contingency and emergency plans are in place? Would such a contingency plan need to define the restriction of movement of people, animals and transport? Would it not include defined exclusion and buffer zones? Would it not need to incorporate measures to destroy animals? What was done with the animals which have been destroyed to date? What additional training has been given to veterinarians involved, some of whom, no more than many people, would not have seen a case of foot and mouth disease?</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey made a valid point. Many people cannot go abroad for various sporting events and they are right to stay at home, but now they are being penalised by airlines which will not refund their tickets. When we are calling upon the general public to do what is right, is it not more appropriate for the Taoiseach to do what is right and cancel his visit to Wales tomorrow?</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister to expand the task force involved in this. Yesterday evening in the Dáil I called for an interdepartmental approach because that is what it entails. Would it not also be appropriate in the national interest to request, as we did yesterday evening, that the Taoiseach address the nation in an emergency bulletin in the media at 6 p.m. or 9.30 p.m. on the importance of doing what is right at this point. Emergency measures should be taken now and they should be mandatory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>When is it expected that the results of the tests on the animals on the farm at Meigh, County Armagh will be available? The Minister indicated that he will have sent to the offices of his Department a code or handbook of practice which they should follow at this stage. Will he undertake to make that available also to veterinary practitioners? Will he add to it, the information on the symptoms of this disease and the various susceptible elements from the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food because it is very clear? Will he also ensure that all of that information for the veterinarians and for the officials of his Department is made available for publication in a place where farmers can have access to it?</P>
      <P>What is the level of involvement of the Army on the Border at present? Will the Minister agree that, in view of this problem in Northern Ireland, Army involvement needs to be substantially increased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will he consider giving guidelines to local authorities in order that they will know how to respond to groups of farmers who want to provide disinfection facilities at strategic points in their areas? We may get to the point where we will require farmers to have disinfection at every entry to their farms. There are farmers all over the country prepared to put disinfection facilities at strategic points in their areas, but the county <Col N="1011" /> councils do not know what to say to them when they make this proposal. Will the Minister ensure that somebody in the Department knows what the county councils can do in that case and tells them what they may do. People want to take action to avoid the spread of this disease.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister issue an official line to the effect that it is contra-indicated that anybody involved in farming or the food trade here should attend the National Food and Meat Exhibition in Manchester, which takes place between 11 and 13 March and where there is usually a large Irish attendance?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Penrose and these were not softly spoken directives issued over the past six days. These directives are creating inconvenience for people, but they are co-operating. They are, in 99.8% of cases, extremely co-operative and are availing of the help lines in the Department.</P>
      <P>In case I forget, some people asked about the Department's website. I will have a look at that when I go back to my office because my understanding is that it is up-to-date. I will make sure it is up-to-the-minute because people use websites. Deputy Dukes referred to the UK website, which is comprehensive, and my understanding is that the Department's website is full of information and is also up-to-date. We will avail of the popular media, and especially the agricultural media like the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, to inform people.</P>
      <P>Last week when the confirmed case occurred in Britain, I asked my Department to look at the situation if we had a confirmed case here and to put a contingency plan in place, and that is being worked on at present.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose asked about training. After the outbreaks in 1941, 1967 and 1981, the Department liaised with the British authorities and since last week they have done so again in this case.</P>
      <P>The Deputy suggested that the Taoiseach make a national broadcast on the matter. I will take that up at tomorrow morning's meeting of the task force.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes asked when the result of the test would be known and my experts tell me they will be known in 96 hours.</P>

      <P>From today.</P>
      <P>He asked that a handbook, including symptoms, clinical signs, etc., be made available and issued widely, especially to veterinary surgeons. He also asked about local authorities. The vast majority of local authorities employ veterinary officers and I will make sure there is communication with local authorities and that a standardised procedure on disinfection within their jurisdictions is made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Army, we made requests on the deployment of the Army and the number of per<Col N="1012" /> sonnel involved will need to be scaled up because of the suspect case adjacent to the Border.</P>
    <P>I will also take on board Deputy Duke's suggesting regarding the Manchester exhibition because of its location and because there may be a risk involved. I will ask people and companies to desist from going there.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing financial and economic matters the preceding debate was highly relevant to the future of the economy, particularly <Col N="1013" /> the rural economy. I hope the preventative measures being implemented by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, his departmental officials and other State agencies will be successful in keeping the country free of foot and mouth disease. Ireland exports £5 billion worth of food and drink products each year. This represents an enormous share of the economy. The agriculture sector is not just of crucial importance to the rural economy, it is the backbone of the national economy. Accordingly, the Minister and various Departments concerned are pursuing the proper course of action by ensuring the highest and most rigorous protective standards are speedily implemented and fully adhered to.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, referred to the huge improvements which have been made to the taxation system. The provisions of the Bill will remove 133,000 taxpayers from the tax net, bringing the total number of income earners excluded to 668,000. This is a clear measure of the success of the economic and fiscal policies pursued by the Government since taking office in June 1997, under which the standard rate of income tax has been reduced by six percentage points.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has introduced welcome changes in stamp duty and measures to encourage the provision of housing. There are severe difficulties confronting house purchasers, particularly first-time buyers, in cities and large urban areas. Most private sector housing is over-priced and, in many instances, of low quality. In administering the grants scheme for new houses the Department of the Environment and Local Government insisted on a certificate of reasonable value endorsed by a departmental inspector prior to the approval of such grants. This requirement should be reintroduced and rigorously implemented. There is widespread concern about the severe over-pricing of housing by a speculative element in the building industry.</P>
      <P>The rural renewal scheme, introduced by the Minister for Finance two or three years ago and applicable in parts of County Cavan and all of counties Leitrim, Longford, Sligo and Roscommon, has been beneficial in providing additional housing units. In particular, it has encouraged young people to provide their own housing.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal to increase the floor area limit for qualifying houses which meet the relevant criteria. He should also consider increasing the floor area limit for existing houses in need of refurbishment. It is important to maintain and restore as much as possible of the older housing stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An issue often raised by county councillors is the need to introduce a grants scheme for house reconstruction. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Molloy, have dramatically improved the valuable grant schemes for essential repairs and disabled persons, both of which are contributing to an <Col N="1014" /> improvement in housing conditions for people with disabilities and elderly persons. They should, however, be streamlined.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a house reconstruction grants scheme would assist those who need to provide additional bedroom accommodation or carry out necessary repairs to their homes, but find the cost of such works prohibitive. Such a scheme would provide a worthwhile incentive to refurbish and upgrade older houses and thereby contribute to the quantity and quality of the housing stock.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvements the Minister is introducing in relation to taxation, including tax relief for third level education fees. I hope this measure will be further improved. Many of those whose incomes are slightly above the qualifying threshold for higher education grants find it extremely expensive to put their children through college.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government introduced a special infrastructural programme to provide for water and sewerage schemes in small towns and villages from which many villages in my county have benefited. The Minister should consider providing additional funding to enhance the programme. It would relieve pressure on housing in larger urban areas if infrastructure was put in place in smaller towns and villages to enable them to be regenerated, to provide additional housing and to ensure a better population spread. This would be particularly beneficial to County Cavan and the constituencies of Deputy Kenny and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Smith, for sharing time with me.</P>
      <P>The Bill develops and builds on measures taken by the Government, not only to facilitate growth, employment and prosperity, but to ensure the tax system is brought into line with what is considered the norm. The reality is that the era of high spend and high taxation government has come to an end. In his address this week to the Houses of Congress President Bush said that the American people had been paying far too much and were long overdue a refund. If that is true of the United States, which has a history of low tax regimes, it is true of Ireland also.</P>
      <P>The Bill introduces innovative new measures to promote savings, to encourage donations, particularly for educational purposes, which I greatly welcome, and to deal with the situation of domestic charities. It also provides for structural changes, including the move to a tax credit system, the alignment of the tax year with the calendar year and the currency conversion to the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central emphasis in the Bill and the budget which preceded it is to return equity to taxpayers. There has been a general welcome for the decision that the tax year will correspond to the calendar year as and from 1 January next. The 6 April start to the income tax year, which is a left<Col N="1015" /> over from the time income tax was introduced on a temporary basis in the 18th century, is to go.</P>
    <P>The most important and significant element in the budget is not the structural tidying up but the cuts in taxation. The cut of 2% in the higher and standard tax rates together with the increases in tax free allowances and the widening of tax bands represent the best deal ever for workers. Thanks to the Government's policies, more people are in work than ever before. When Fianna Fáil entered office in 1997, the basic income tax personal allowance was £2,900 per annum for a single person and £5,800 for a married couple. We have radically improved the tax allowances, not just in this budget but in the years since 1997. A single person on the standard rate now has a tax free allowance of £5,500 and it is £11,000 for a married couple with one earner. The Bill will increase PAYE allowances from £1,000 to £2,000 bringing total tax free allowances of PAYE workers to a remarkable £7,500 and £13,000 for single people and married couples respectively. We should all celebrate that achievement because the basis on which it has been done has been put in place by a number of Administrations. However, this Administration has delivered and is delivering tax equity.</P>
    <P>We have also radically changed the number of people paying taxes in the different tax bands. We have now removed more than 209,000 people from the tax net. These were people on low, marginal wages and it is appropriate that they should be removed from the tax net. Over our four budgets, we have removed 268,000 people from the top rate of tax and put them on the standard rate. The threshold at which the top rate was previously applied was unacceptable. These changes make a massive difference to the take home pay of every worker. They also make a massive difference to the national psyche and the approach to taxation.</P>
    <P>The difference the Government has made is best demonstrated by the level at which people begin to pay the higher rate of tax. In 1997, which is not long ago, a single person began paying the top rate of tax when they earned more than £9,900. A single person does not pay the top rate of tax now until they earn more than £20,000. It is astonishing to listen to people from the Labour Party criticising this. It seems they were happy for people to hit the higher rate of tax at less than £10,000. That is a level no one in their right mind could support.</P>
    <P>Our progress in lowering the standard rate of tax is in stark contrast to that of the Opposition when in Government. Where we have reduced the standard rate by 6% since coming into office, the Opposition during its term achieved a decrease of just one miserly percentage point. That is on record and is an objective fact. The Opposition parties' inability to reward the people for their hard work was highlighted by Deputy McDowell on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on the night of the previous budget. He said he <Col N="1016" /> would not have reduced tax rates to 20% and 42% and, in saying that, he was telling the truth. History shows that the ideological commitment of socialist parties throughout Europe is to high spending which, by necessity, requires high taxation regimes.</P>
    <P>Since the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, the Labour Party has been mute on this issue. Where its members are loquacious on everything else, it is very difficult to get them to admit that a vote for Labour, and by extension a vote for Fine Gael, is a vote for a higher taxation regime. I tell my constituents in Wicklow that is the case, but I cannot get the Labour Party to engage in a debate on it. It would be a bad mistake for Fine Gael to engage in a similar debate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extraordinary changes for old age pensioners. I am sure we all agree that whatever we have achieved is because of the commitment of preceding generations. It is therefore appropriate and right that, at a time when the nation has something to celebrate in its economic achievements, they are shared with old age pensioners.</P>

      <P>I certainly do. The last thing I want to do is insult Deputy Kenny. He has had a bad fortnight. When the finances were in the charge of the leader of the Labour Party and social welfare rights were in the charge of the President of the Labour Party, Deputy De Rossa &ndash; an occasional visitor to the House &ndash; under the rainbow coalition, Deputy Kenny was willing to defend the most miserable increases to pensioners. I celebrate the fact this Government is in a position to give a record increase this year on top of the record increases it gave last year and the year before, and I celebrate the fact we have extended the medical card across the board to pensioners.</P>
      <P>Another change I welcome is the savings scheme, and I was amazed by Deputy McDowell's remarks on this. I am sure we all accept the fact, as does anyone who knows anything about the economy, that there has been an extraordinary and disastrous slippage in the level of savings over the past 15 years. The marginal propensity to save is disastrously low by any objective standard and it is right and proper that the Bill should address that issue. The savings scheme, which was rightly described by the Consumers' Association of Ireland as the best savings plan on the planet, is a marvellous scheme, and I compliment the Minister on introducing it. It is something we should have done before. It is like every good idea. When it is implemented, one must ask why it was not done before. It will have three major effects: it will move more people into savings, which is welcome, it will deflate an economy which is overspending, and it will encourage people to look to the future.</P>
      <P>The achievements of the Government as regards the national debt have been put on record but it is worth reminding ourselves that the rainbow coalition increased the debt by £600 million during its term in office while we reduced it to the second lowest in the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxation relief for ship owners is one taxation issue which has been overlooked by successive Governments. We are an island nation and have not ever recognised that reality. For reasons I can neither understand nor trace, we have always been deficient in maritime and marine related policies. When I was a civil servant in the then Department of Transport and Power under the late Brian Lenihan, we introduced the Shipping Investment Grants Act. It was prudent legislation which assisted the shipyard in Cork because there was a bias towards supporting domestically built ships. It also tried to bring new shipping tonnage <Col N="1018" /> on to the Irish register. At one point the expansion of the B &amp; I and the Irish Shipping fleets depended on that Act. Tragically, Irish Shipping was sunk by Deputy Mitchell and his colleagues and B &amp; I has moved out of public ownership.</P>
    <P>As an island nation we have the lowest level of tonnage for a long time. I have asked the Minister to consider introducing a tax tonnage regime along the lines operated by 12 EU member states. Even Luxembourg, has a tax tonnage regime for shipping. I can understand the Minister being reluctant to do it this year, but the absence of a balancing measure on tax tonnage for shipping will have a disastrous effect. We have already lost a number of ships off the Irish register. Arklow Shipping, one of the largest shipping operators in the State, is willing to put additional tonnage on the register but cannot do so because of the absence of a tax tonnage regime. As it is not possible, because the mandarins in Brussels have the knives out for us, for him to accept an amendment to the Bill at this stage, will the Minister give an undertaking that he will give the issue serious consideration in the next Finance Bill? I am sure the proposition would have the support of all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill enacts the provisions announced in the budget before Christmas. The Minister who was publicly criticised recently by our European partners for the parameters laid down in the budget intimated that there was jealously in Europe at our strong economy, but I do not believe that. What we have done is respected. Nevertheless, we should be seen to be playing ball and obeying the rules by sticking to agreements made. As these issues have been covered by our spokesperson on finance, Deputy Jim Mitchell, I will not elaborate on them.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a number of issues of interest to me. I am disappointed at the lack of attention paid to the protection of our environment in the Bill. No fiscal measures have been introduced to develop badly needed recycling initiatives. Although objections have been raised at local, county and regional level about landfills and incineration, one rarely hears about the low level of recycling. Of the waste produced, 91% is consigned to landfills. About 3% of domestic waste is recycled.</P>
      <P>The recycling industry is based on voluntary effort. It relies on members of the public to bring the waste they produce to bottle banks and so on. On a pilot basis, there is a limited door-to-door collection of recyclables in a number of areas. The issue must be addressed. There is strong public desire that we do so. Provisions to deal with it should have been included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> Recycling is a difficult industry. It is a known fact that it is cheaper to produce paper from virgin material than to recycle. Ensuring recycled paper is cheaper to produce than virgin paper will require Government intervention by way of financial support. Recycling should also be classed as a manufacturing industry. There are many initiatives the Minister could have taken to deal with the issue. I had hoped the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who is concerned about waste reduction would use his influence to ensure the problem of recycling was addressed in a meaningful way. That will not happen if we continue to proceed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>Repak, the scheme introduced to deal with commercial packaging waste, is not working; it has not been successful. The Minister admitted in reply to questions in the House that he was not satisfied with the progress being made by local authorities in producing waste management plans under the Waste Management Act. He stated that he would have to introduce new measures to ensure action was taken. I hope the new measures to be introduced will extend to plastics for which we there are no collection facilities. Rehab, the largest collector of recyclable bottles, tins, glass and so on, does not receive State support, an issue that must be addressed. Recyclable products have a value. A target of recycling 50% of waste products has been set. This will not be met unless financial measures are put in place. Many other countries operate imaginative schemes. It is disappointing that no provision is made in the Bill to deal with the issue. I hope the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Finance will look again at ways of dealing with what is a very real problem.</P>
    <P>There was much comment at budget time about the issue of child care. The allocation provided for in the national development plan is not being drawn down in many areas. The provision of child care places is stagnant. I received a telephone call yesterday from a girl who cannot secure planning permission for a child care facility. I am aware that the issue does not come within the remit of the Minister for Finance, but providing for an increase in child benefit is not the solution to the problem, much more needs to be done. Of a class of 100 who graduated in the area of child care from a school of commerce in Cork, only ten are working in the industry which does not pay well. The remainder have either taken up employment in other areas or left the country.</P>
    <P>Child care is a low paying industry which is not attracting new entrants. The answer does not lie in increasing child benefit. The increases granted in previous budgets have been absorbed by increased crèche charges. There is a need for affordable and reliable child care facilities. The lack of such facilities is one of the main reasons women cannot commit to re-entering the jobs market. Older persons who would have accepted <Col N="1020" /> a position as a child care provider, having reared their own children, have taken up part time jobs on comparable pay in banks, etc. The problem is multi-faceted. Funding available under the national development plan is not being drawn down because of the difficulties being experienced in obtaining staff and securing premises.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced the introduction of the living over the shop scheme last September, which I welcome. Tax incentives, similar to those provided under the urban renewal scheme, have been provided in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Wateford. Many buildings in Cork could be utilised in this way. If the scheme is advertised and promoted locally, it will lead to the regeneration of our cities, as has happened in many parts of Dublin. It is important that contact is made with county and city managers to ensure the scheme is fully utilised and people are brought back to our cities.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on so ably playing the part of Leonardo DiCaprio in riding the Celtic tiger which, when one examines it more closely, looks more like the <i>Titanic</i> on a fated voyage. The Minister is presiding over substantial growth in energy demand and waste output as his friends continue to sip champagne as if there were no problems in the offing. I hope we can have a realistic debate about the prospects for the future. There is a need to realise that the fines that will be incurred because of our broken promises in respect of the Kyoto Protocol and other legally binding international agreements into which we have entered will cost the country dear, a matter which ought to be of interest to the Minister. There will also be a significant cost to <Col N="1021" /> the State in terms of the human misery caused in the wake of the performance of the Celtic tiger by the difficulties encountered in providing accommodation and in the health service. Many have to live in appalling conditions. The poverty trap particularly affects single parents and those who are unable to take advantage of the many jobs available which, in many cases, are so badly paid that they result in impoverishment rather than enhancement of quality of life.</P>
      <P>The level of investment in public transport is so poor that people wonder whether they are martyrs, rather than civic minded, in using public transport. Their perception ought to be that they are trying to prevent chaos on our roads.</P>

I gcomparáid lena lán daoine atá ag íoc 42% níl a fhios agam conas is féidir leis an Rialtas a rá go bhfuil siad i bhfábhar ísliú cánach sa tslí sin. Is é an cáin íseal atá ag na daoine is saibhre sa tír agus má tá scaranna ag duine níl le h-íoc ag duine ach 20% cánach ar Capital Gains Tax ach oiread. Dá bharr sin is iad na daoine a bhfuil airgead acu atá i bhfábhar na Bille seo don chuid is mó. Tá an cuma céanna ar an gcóras coigealtais, Savings Scheme, chomh maith. Is iad na daoine ag a bhfuil níos mó airgid gur féidir an méid is mó brabúis a thuilleamh.</P>
      <P>The Minister managed to get us into a mess on the budget with our EU colleagues, particularly the European Commission. Deputy Clune said that we are all in favour of centralisation, but we are not; we are in favour of economic co-operation. When one considers the degree to which we will increasingly be told how to organise our budget one will realise that we have sold out on much of the independence for which we fought long and hard. On that basis there is a need for a more rational debate on how should we proceed from here.</P>
      <P>We are reaching the point where we will have a debate on the Nice Treaty, the ramifications of which should be debated in the House. If he continues to disregard European rules, the Minister will run into more brick walls.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Coghlan on her elevation to the rank of Minister of State. It is a well deserved tribute for her endeavours.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives legal effect to the budget. It is the legislation that drives the management of our prosperity in an equal society. I would like to think that its prudent use will lead to a situation where families will grow up in communities, <Col N="1022" /> where common sense and balance will apply in granting planning permissions for development where people will be more important than grass or wind, where the young will show respect and have opportunities available to them and where the old will be respected in security and comfort. Unfortunately, there are many instances where this does not apply.</P>
    <P>The headlines in the national newspapers this evening state that it took 20,000 people two hours to travel 12 miles into the city today. Given the reverberations from the Celtic tiger, one cannot put a price on the business lost, the loss of economic attractiveness and on the frustration, bad feeling and ill will caused.</P>
    <P>There is something missing from the economy which, on the one hand, is being powered along like a well-oiled machine for which we have all paid and of which we can justly be proud, but which, on the other, leaves a great deal to be desired in terms of its effect. It is like a hollow shell whereby hundreds of millions of pounds are paid to consultancy bodies and agencies for reports on various developmental issues without real management of the prosperity generated for everyone's benefit. What is missing, in the context of the national development plan, a substantial document covering every conceivable idea from Malin Head to Mizen Head, is a public-private partnership involving a world class management consultancy project team, of which there are a number in Ireland, to implement the proposals contained in the plan not only by setting targets and objectives, but by specifying timescales for their implementation.</P>
    <P>Last week the chairman of the National Roads Authority spoke about the development of dual carriageways from Dublin to Waterford, Cork, Limerick and Galway. Given that there can be objections, CPOs, archaeological excavations, questions about contract capacity, etc., the targets for that kind of development will not be achieved under the current capacity. The Government should ask project team consultancy firms of world class standard in Ireland to move in to ensure the proposals in the national development plan are delivered on time. This would be a worthwhile move.</P>
    <P>Under the new savings scheme, which was heralded by the Minister and the Tánaiste last week, the maximum amount which can be saved is £200 per month for five years. At the end of that time the Minister will give back a quarter of that amount to the saver. Does this mean the £200 paid in during the sixtieth month must remain in the account for five years before the interest is paid or will the full interest be paid on the maximum amount saved after the sixtieth contribution? We have been told these savings will be taxed at the normal rate. However, this will depend on the rate the banks are offering. If people are to be enthused about this scheme a rate higher than 3.9% should be offered. Extra facilities should be made available for people over 65 years. Many of the people in the active <Col N="1023" /> age retirement associations do not think they will be around in five years to avail of the maximum return on their savings. The Minister might consider reducing the period to three years for those over 65 years.</P>
    <P>If the scheme is a success and £2.5 billion is invested each year for five years, giving a savings account of £12.5 billion, the Minister will have to pay out much interest. The Government takes in approximately £130 million in DIRT each year, which amounts to £650 million over five years. If the scheme is as successful as envisaged, then consideration should be given to the abolition of DIRT.</P>
    <P>The National Treasury Management Agency recommended that people should invest their money in post office savings over a period of, I think, 4.9 years at a certain rate of interest. Was the National Treasury Management Agency consulted about the savings scheme? Are people being advised to take up the new savings scheme with banks and other financial institutions as against the recommendation of the National Treasury Management Agency? What is the difference between the two schemes and which one is best? Should one take the advice of the Minister for Finance or of the National Treasury Management Agency? Will a person who has money in a deposit account be entitled to ask the bank to shift the money to the savings scheme as it might attract a greater rate of interest? Has the Minister looked at the liquidity ratios in an effort to keep money in the country? We hear that Brussels has full control over our money, but that money is in the Central Bank system and could be retained here.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister, Deputy Woods, said education is the engine of the Celtic Tiger. In his analysis of the economy &ldquo;Growing by Knowing &ndash; How Ireland's expansion can be sustained&rdquo; Jim O'Leary of Davy Stockbrokers said in relation to wages that public sector pay is the main part of the PPF and that if we want to retain people in teaching, nursing and other professions we will have to look to paying more or suffer the consequences as people vote with their feet. It appears as if this year's leaving certificate examination will not have the traditional involvement of teachers. The Labour Court will deal with this matter next week. It is difficult to see the Labour Court over-ruling the Government agreement with the social partners and unions, involving 235,000 civil servants, as otherwise it would stand for naught. The supervision and substitution elements, which are causing so much trouble among members of the teaching profession, particularly in second level schools, should be taken out and dealt with quickly under the benchmarking system. The remaining problems can be either ring fenced or analysed and clarified by the commission which I called for last year.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, will deal with the Belmullet task force report which was to be sent to the Minister of <Col N="1024" /> State, Deputy Ó Cúiv. This report is a microcosm of a national development plan and it cannot work unless the Minister of State marries it to a contracting company which will set implementation dates. The Minister of State should tell the Taoiseach that she cannot do this job unless he gives her political direction and authority to cross Department so that she can get what she needs. The report contains a series of recommendations by Departments, local authorities and agencies but they will not be implemented unless the Minister of State has the necessary political clout. I will support her in what she does. As a new Minister of State she is entitled to make one wish and I hope she does as I have suggested.</P>

      <P>Radical income redistribution in favour of those on low incomes is central to reducing poverty and creating an inclusive society.

      <P>Income tax changes have favoured the rich rather than lower earners. Under the Finance Bill people on a minimum wage of £171.60 come within the income tax bracket. This cannot be allowed to continue and I ask the Minister to amend the Bill to ensure that those on the minimum wage are taken out of the tax net.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the lack of child care measures in the budget. The necessary measures must be put in place to assist parents to purchase child care. The lack of Government support for parents in meeting child care costs is a travesty. The child care needs of parents, who have been hugely instrumental in creating the Celtic Tiger economy, have been ignored. Parents continue to pay for child care out of taxed income. In the past two budgets the Government sent out the clear message that supporting parents in paying for child care is not its responsibility. It is out of line with every Government in modern Europe in this regard. This policy is irresponsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reconciliation of work and family life is critical to the achievement of gender equality in society and equal participation in employment. The absence of family friendly policies in employment makes it more difficult for women to remain in paid work, to have real choices regarding work options or to improve their labour market position in terms of pay and promotional opportunities. The commitments made in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to provide equitable financial support for all parents must be fulfilled. This can only be done through the provision of a universal child care payment for all parents irrespective of their employment or income status. It is essential that access to affordable, quality child care is provided for all parents <Col N="1025" /> through the introduction of a universal parental child care payment at a rate of, say, £20 for children under five years and £10 for those aged between five and 14 years.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Finance Bill does not contain incentives under the town renewal scheme announced almost 12 months ago. Incentives for commercial and industrial development in designated towns were to be introduced late last year, but this has not happened.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question the Minister indicated that he is having difficulty with the European Commission on this issue and said that as things stand it appears it will take some more months before the business tax incentive elements of the scheme will be approved by the Commission. I wonder whether the Minister's recent difficulty with the Commission is having a negative effect on this scheme, which is worthwhile and is badly needed in towns in my constituency, such as Cahir, Cashel, Fethard, Killenaule and other towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The position of first time house buyers is one which gives cause for concern. I wonder whether the Minister is aware of the serious housing crisis? If there are first time house buyers who cannot afford to buy their homes there will be large scale numbers on local authority housing lists with little or no hope of being housed.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Finance Bill and congratulate the Minister on its introduction. I will refer to the changes in stamp duty, the change in the 2 per cent anti-speculative property tax and the changes to the proposed share option scheme. Certainly the flat 9 per cent stamp duty for investors in new property was a source of great concern to many in the western region who had many meetings to discuss it. There was even a suggestion that there might be a special tax for the so-called border, midlands and western region. That was never going to be introduced by the Minister but he has now said the new rate will be 3 per cent for properties up to £100,000. The same rate applies to properties to first time owner occupiers for properties valued at more than £100,000. The invester rate for second-hand properties will remain at 9 per cent. That is welcome. On the anti-speculative property tax he said the Government would review it and it would only apply to a limited number of people. I welcome also the share option scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great benefits of the Bill is that a new saving scheme is being introduced. People have been talking about savings for a long time. As a nation we do not get serious about savings until we see a proposal such as this. Given that the scheme is innovative there will be a good response. There is great interest in it and it will <Col N="1026" /> be assisted by a top up to a net saving of 25 per cent out of tax revenue by the State. When the scheme commences on 1 May 2001 savers will be anxious to save for five years. Deputy Kenny asked about the actual workings of the scheme. The Minister will provide further details. However, in an example of a person deciding to save £50 per month for a five year period he made the point that this person would have £4,050 at the end of the five years for £3,000 saved, a gain of £1,050 after tax. A person who would save, say, £200 per month would have £16,204 at the end of five years, a gain of £4,204 after tax. This is a useful scheme.</P>
    <P>I have spoken with a number of people in the credit union movement. Given the difficulties the Minister has had with the Irish League of Credit Unions he may not like me to use the words &ldquo;credit union&rdquo;. They made the point since the playing field has been levelled between all financial institutions that they are concerned that the banks are still trying to take business from them. They are concerned that the older people who have saved for many years with credit unions will not able to join the savings scheme. They are of the view that the Minister should look at it again. It is clear to me from the credit unions in north Galway that the League of Credit Unions has not consulted widely. It told the Minister what the credit union movement wants.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which the Minister and all of us have had with the credit unions, is that the League of Credit Unions says one thing and the local credit union offices say something else. While this may be a difficult matter to deal with I hope the Minister would always favour some bias towards credit unions. I am more in favour of credit unions than of any other financial institution. The previous Government put a 20 per cent cap on credit union borrowings at a time when we were all in agreement here that more money should be available for loans. If they are to be given an opportunity to compete with other financial institutions it is time that cap was lifted.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent announcement concerning changes to the mobility allowance. There was much concern after it was announced that the £45 per month would be taken from those who had their own transport. I met a group from Galway, Mayo and Kerry and the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, two days after the budget, and made a strong case to the Minister for Finance. I am pleased the Minister has said that while he has doubled the allowance for those who do not have access to transport he will allow the continuation of the £45 allowance for those who have transport. While those who have transport get exemptions on VRT, VAT, a refund of excise duty on up to 600 gallons of fuel per year and exemptions on road tax they still have to pay car insurance. In all cases that £45 was put towards the car insurance.</P>
    <P>The Vantastic scheme which operates in many cities does not operate in rural Galway. It is important that the mobility allowance be the <Col N="1027" /> same as it was irrespective of whether the recipient has transport. The Minister has rectified that in his announcement on the changes to the mobility allowance.</P>
    <P>An issue I have raised on a number of occasions is higher education grants. While it does not come directly under the Finance Bill, something will have to be done at Government level given the higher rents for students and the cost of transport. I am pleased there is a provision in the Bill for tax relief on third level fees. This will remove some of the restrictions. The four existing tax reliefs will be merged and standardised. The restrictions that applied for repeat years or more than one course or the exclusion of medicine, dentistry, veterinary, or teacher training will be removed. Relief will be extended for post-graduate fees paid in the US and other countries, not covered by existing schemes. We must ensure the third level institutions provide campus accommodation. The Bill provides for the rent-a-room scheme where a room or rooms in a person's private residence can be let as residential accommodation. The gross annual rental income of less than £6,000 will be exempt from tax. I note the Minister will provide on Committee Stage for some of the proposals of the commission on the private rented housing sector. That would cater for across the board priority housing needs but I ask him to look again at students who have had great difficulty in getting accommodation.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting proposal for carers. While the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has increased the payment under the provisions of the Social Welfare Bill and has given a good income disregard, the Minister for Finance has said the amount that may be claimed to employ a carer will be increased from £8,500 to £10,000. Relief at the marginal rate of tax is available for the employment of a carer for a family member who is incapacitated. That is welcome. The definition of &ldquo;medical expenses&rdquo; has been widened as has the definition of &ldquo;relative&rdquo; which will include persons currently included in the dependant relative allowance category. Taxpayers will be able to claim relief on medical expenses for designated relatives instead of first having to claim the dependant relative allowance for which there is an income limit or engaging in the covenant procedure. The Minister will table an amendment to the Bill on Committee Stage to provide for the inclusion of expenditure on educational psychologists and speech therapists within the relief. It is vital, particularly in relation to primary education, that psychologists and speech therapists are made available for children. What the Minister has introduced is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the budget of £1.2 billion in personal tax reductions. This will remove more than 133,000 low paid people, including the elderly, from the tax net. The reduction in income tax rates will involve <Col N="1028" /> approximately 1.2 million taxpayers. There has been criticism by the European Commission. I do not understand why it is worried about what the Minister is doing because he has been very prudent. The savings scheme is a good example of where he has been prudent in taking measures to encourage savings and reduce inflation. Criticising the Minister for reducing the top rate of income tax is somewhat misplaced. The widening of the standard rate tax band and reducing the percentage of taxpayers on the top rate of income tax to 23% is the relevant figure when the exempt cases are included.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. The Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the views of Members on all sides of the House. He has introduced a Bill which will be the basis for improving the economy and improving the standard of living of everyone in the country in the months and years ahead.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Coughlan, every success in her new appointment. She took the big jump last week but most people will agree she had a very long run up to it. Many of my colleagues may be disappointed at being overlooked on this occasion but there could not be a more popular choice and I wish Deputy Coughlan well.</P>
      <P>On the Finance Bill, politics is a funny game and no one knows that better than the Minister. Six months ago, surveys indicated half the country wanted him locked up but if one were carried out now, he would be seen almost as Santa Claus. He introduced a budget last December from which everyone will benefit. Even the social partners, who were given every opportunity to put forward their views on how it should be framed, were surprised at a number of the provisions and the generosity shown by the Government. Members on the opposite side of the House were very critical of some of the changes made by the Minister, particularly in previous budgets. One of the changes relate to the reduction in capital gains tax. He was criticised at the time for a introducing a reduction which would benefit the poor. This is a self-financing tax reduction whereby we are gaining more from reducing the tax than was the case heretofore.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a vision of where he sees the economy going. The steps he has taken, particularly in relation to capital gains tax, are very welcome because this will mean more money for the Exchequer. However, I would encourage him to show a little bit more initiative in this regard. Reducing the tax even further for those who keep shares for a longer period would encourage more people to invest in shares and reduce the speculative element in purchasing shares. This system operates in other European countries and could be considered here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only negative comment I heard in relation to the savings scheme was from the Fine Gael spokesman. Given that he is new in the job, perhaps he felt he had to oppose the measure. This <Col N="1029" /> measure has gone down extremely well among ordinary people throughout the country and I appeal to the Minister to consider reducing the age limit. When the scheme was announced, the intention was that anyone with a PRSI number who was 18 years or over could enter the scheme. It is important that young people be given an opportunity to participate in this savings scheme. In recent weeks, there has been a great deal of negative publicity about young people dropping out of third level education and about under age drinking. To a large extent, young people feel excluded. This is a very imaginative scheme and there is no reason young people cannot be allowed to participate in it. Many young people who are working part-time during the week or at week-ends have money and they should be given an opportunity to save it wisely. There is a tremendous gain at the end of the five year period and I appeal to the Minister to give young people this opportunity.</P>
    <P>I read in this morning's newspapers that the Minister is making major changes in relation to the smoking issue. Being Ash Wednesday, it is fitting that he should announce these changes today. He is considering banning cigarette vending machines in pubs. That is a serious mistake because vending machines are a very secure way of doing business as far as publicans are concerned. It will have serious consequences if publicans or other shopkeepers are forced to carry large stocks of cigarettes. This will lead to increased insurance costs for these premises. From the point of view of theft, it will make it much easier to steal cigarettes. Shopkeepers must be allowed to continue selling cigarettes through vending machines. This will not be a problem if the machines are placed strategically in a pub. We are reaching a ridiculous stage where it will be easier to buy a packet of condoms than a packet of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister is serious about reducing the numbers smoking cigarettes. I applaud him for his efforts, particularly in relation to the ban on advertising cigarettes. These sexy advertising campaigns are targeted at young people who believe it is fashionable to smoke. Unfortunately, the tobacco industry is very wealthy and has spent millions of pounds trying to encourage young people to smoke. The reason is that great numbers of its customers are dying. It is as simple and straightforward as that. Smoking kills and the industry must recruit young people. While I welcome the Minister's initiatives in relation to the ban on advertising, he should look again at the ban on vending machines. From a shopkeeper's point of view, this is a very secure way of doing business. If these machines are strategically placed, it will reduce the risk of young people purchasing cigarettes.</P>
    <P>On the foot and mouth crisis, much of the talk in County Kildare in recent days has been about Cheltenham. While I see no possibility of the festival going ahead, if it does, it is important for people to look at the bigger picture and not con<Col N="1030" /> sider their own interests. Sacrifices will have to be made. Aidan O'Brien expressed the view that Istabraq would run in the champions' hurdle. People like him must give leadership and set an example in the present crisis. While it would mean a lot to those connected with it and to those interested in racing for the horse to win a fourth championship hurdle, Mr. O'Brien's choice of words this morning was unfortunate. I appeal to him to rethink what he said.</P>
    <P>Some months ago a meeting was held with the Taoiseach when we outlined the difficulties experienced by stable staff. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has taken a good interest in this but, unfortunately, we have not seen the kinds of changes that are necessary. Many stable staff are being asked to work in facilities, especially at the racecourses, that no other industry or people would tolerate. A few race tracks have taken the initiative and have provided modern and acceptable facilities, but in many cases no hot food or accommodation is provided. The staff travel to the racecourse perhaps two hours before the first race and they may have to wait for approximately 30 minutes after the last race. It can be a long day, especially in the winter months.</P>
    <P>The Minister is drafting legislation to create a new authority to oversee racing. Unless we address this matter quickly there will be difficulties in attracting new people to the industry and retaining present staff. Many other industries have employment opportunities on offer with all kinds of enticements but the racing industry must hold on to its staff. They have a special expertise that is acknowledged and appreciated throughout the world but we should not take them for granted. They have not had a voice in the past but they are organising themselves. They play an important part in the racing industry and they should be properly compensated and rewarded.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Finance to look at the stable staff bonus scheme which has been in operation for less than year. It should have presented a wonderful opportunity to reward stable staff for their involvement. The scheme provides that a percentage of the winnings should be deducted and paid among the staff. Unfortunately, trainers are being asked to make a payment. I have been in contact with the Minister and the Taoiseach about the scheme but unless changes are made it will have to be scrapped, which would be most unfortunate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and I look forward to Committee Stage when the Bill will be considered in greater detail. The Bill this year is bigger than normal because it deals with two one off features. First, the forthcoming tax period will last nine months because of the changeover to the commencement of the tax year to coincide with the start of the calendar year. This change is long overdue and it is an appropriate time to make it. Second, this time next year all reference to <Col N="1031" /> money will be in the form of euros. People will need time to adapt to these two major changes. The social welfare year is also being changed to commence at the start of the calendar year. The social welfare increases and tax benefits to be announced in the next budget will be implemented from 1 January 2002, which I hope will be several months prior to the next general election.</P>
      <P>The overall figures announced in the budget speak for themselves. The taxation measure means that a total of £1.2 billion has been given back to the taxpayer. It is right that the Minister should seek to return the money paid by taxpayers. Tax rates were high in the past because of high unemployment and the need to finance high social welfare payments. However, due to the successful policies pursued by the Minister and the Government there has been an increase in the number employed from 1.4 million to 1.7 million people. That has resulted in more people contributing to the Exchequer and fewer claiming social welfare payments while the Government has been able to reduce the income tax rates. The standard rate is to be reduced from 22% to 20% while the marginal rate is to be reduced from 44% to 42%.</P>
      <P>The Opposition proposes to introduce a medium income tax rate of 30%. I reject that idea and will oppose it. It is likely that a standard rate of 20% and a marginal rate of 40% will apply. That is adequate because it is important that the tax system be simple, transparent and easily understood by the taxpayers. Two rates &ndash; the standard and marginal &ndash; will be sufficient for the future.</P>
      <P>Medical expenses tax relief will be allowed to all designated relatives and not only to those claiming a dependent relative's allowance. This will allow people to claim tax relief where they pay bills and medical expenses for members of their family, be it a parent or otherwise. I am also pleased that tax relief will apply in respect of expenses incurred with educational psychologists and speech therapists.</P>
      <P>The Minister is allowing tax relief on the first £100 of trade union membership dues. I welcome that. Most of the trade unions make a small contribution to the Labour Party from the dues their members pay. I would not like the Government to be giving tax relief in respect of donations to the Labour Party. I am sure that is not the Minster's intention, but it is necessary to ensure on Committee Stage that political contributions arising from union dues do not benefit from tax relief. It would be inappropriate and against the spirit of the House to proceed on that basis. I would object strongly if the Labour Party was to be favoured in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not intend to make charitable donations to the Labour Party. I wish to see the potential anomaly I have raised addressed. Some people may say the Minister is an immodest man. One of his predecessors, also called Charlie, is still remembered, 30 years later, for introducing free travel for old age pensioners. The Minister has a comparable if not greater achievement to his credit with the introduction of a free medical card to everybody over 70 years of age. A medical card is more valuable to most people than their free travel pass. That is the test by which the Government will be judged at the next general election. It is not just generating income for people at work; it is looking after the elderly as well.</P>
      <P>The Minister in the budget provided funding for the centres for independent living and the Carer's Association and he gave a special £0.5 million allocation for the breast cancer unit in Portlaoise General Hospital. The Taoiseach was down there last Friday to turn the sod on the new extension and we are very pleased that this should come about.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned reducing the annual paper chase in his speech last night. I will highlight a situation I mentioned to the Minister in correspondence in recent weeks. There are well over half a million Eircom shareholders and people who have shares in what were formerly the building societies. A person showed me documentation the other day indicating that he had 100 shares in Eircom. He received a dividend of 98p and had a tax credit of 26p. He will have to go through a whole rigmarole if he wants to be a completely compliant taxpayer. He will have to fill in his income tax return form and if he has to pay the balance at the top rate, he will owe the Exchequer 28p or, alternatively, he might be due a rebate. A minimum figure of, say, £100 should be introduced below which people do not have to send in a return because it will create an unnecessary paper chase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> The new savings scheme recently announced by the Minister is a godsend. It will result in people getting approximately a 7% return on their income after tax for the duration of the scheme. That is a good return after tax. I asked the Minister before the budget to consider increasing the figure for registration for business for VAT purposes. The £40,000 turnover, which was introduced years ago, is farcical. I understand the figure in England is at least twice that. We should eliminate some of the unnecessary paperwork for small businesses. I look forward to discussing all these matters in detail with the Minister on Committee Stage next week.</P>

      <P>There are two specific matters in regard to the Finance Bill, 2001. I bring to the Minister's attention something which is not ever too far from his mind, that is, the credit unions. Whatever the League of Credit Unions has said or done, many of its component members are not happy with what is contained in the Finance Bill. They have said the Minister is levelling the field for all financial institutions. All I can say &ndash; it is a matter I will take up on Committee Stage, if I get the opportunity &ndash; is that one cannot compare the major banks with the credit unions. It is neither fair nor reasonable when one considers the type of clientele credit unions have, what they do, how they do it and the fact those involved work for nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see what is happening here. I compliment the Minister on his new savings scheme. I consider it a good scheme, certainly for young people starting out.</P>
      <P>To return to the credit unions, I put it to the Minister that given the way he is approaching this, the banks will have the same privileges as credit unions. That is neither fair nor reasonable. It is only now that the real credit union members are catching on to what is happening. Whether the Minister took his cue from the league of credit unions or has done what he has always wanted to do with the credit unions is a mute question. It appears that the Minister did not ever like the credit unions. This proposal shows scant regard for what those people have done voluntarily. There are no shareholders or profits of millions of pounds, yet when the Minister got the chance, he seemed to put all the financial institutions in the one category. I do not have time to go through the&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is what the Minister is at and we had better open it up to scrutiny so the public can decide for themselves.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how the Minister's fingerprints are on the disabled driver's scheme. There is a new proposal to increase the allowance from £45 to £90 per month, which is good. However, there is an either-or situation. People will no longer be able to claim the VRT and the VAT on a suitable car but will have to claim one or the other. What a group to have a gun put to its head by the Minister. It is not right that he should do this to people in wheelchairs or those who are otherwise disabled. I have been on to the Minister's Department and, according to his officials, this is the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very critical of the Minister in recent years but at times, I agree with him. When he says he will do something, he does it, and I must compliment him on that. I do not want to be always critical of him. There are some very good points in the budget and some disastrous ones.</P>
      <P>The Minister let me down badly on one issue. I was on his side, although he would not believe that. The 9% tax on second houses was the one thing the Minister did that actually worked in the past 12 months in relation to enabling young people to get houses. The Minister stopped the investors and the money merchants from Dublin, Cork and elsewhere from going around the country buying three, four or five houses and getting tax breaks and relief on them. The Minister made a mistake last night in changing that and I was very disappointed in him. If a motion had been tabled, I would have voted with the Minister on that issue because I believed he was right. The builders, the power brokers, were certainly able to get the Fianna Fáil backbenchers and frontbenchers to put pressure on the Minister and the Government to change this. This was working. I am an auctioneer and I speak against my interests but I have seen young couples and young people who could not buy property. For the first time in a few years, there was a bit of hope when the price of property began to decrease in the past 12 months. What the Minister did last night was wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To hell with the builders. They were making money, as we have seen, in the past ten and 15 <Col N="1035" /> years. They appear to have been giving it away as quickly as they were making it, although I am sure they were not giving away everything they were making. They were giving money away in buckets, bags and everything else. We see now that they will win again and I think it is wrong.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister did not give an opportunity to those on middle incomes, who want to repair their houses. There will be a further crisis in respect of people on middle incomes who have been buying out their houses for the past ten or 15 years. There is no grant for them.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had wanted to help young couples, he could have increased the first time buyers' grant. It has been £3,000 for the past ten years and the Minister should have substantially increased the amount because it would help young couples to get into the housing market. I would have liked to have seen that happen. Perhaps the Minister should look at restoring grants for those on middle incomes &ndash; I am not talking about millionaires &ndash; to restore and repair their houses.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, there has been a big gas find off north Mayo. I heard the previous speaker speak about next year and maybe with a bit of luck he will be on this side of the House and we will have a new Government by the time the next Finance Bill comes around. I believe that will happen and that we will have a general election.</P>
    <P>In relation to infrastructure, the road from Longford to Westport is a disgrace. It is no wonder we cannot get investment in the west, that people do not want to invest there and that people cannot get jobs when we have to travel on that road. Now we have natural gas and we have been told it will benefit the whole country. I hope the price to be paid will be the provision of necessary infrastructure in the west. A proper national primary route should be built from Longford to Belmullet. I want to put the Minister, the Government and the county council on alert that if the people of north Mayo do not gain from the gas find, there will not be much gas leaving north Mayo. It may be carried out overground, but it certainly will not be carried underground. That is a guarantee. North Mayo is in serious need of infrastructure and development. The IDA has turned its back on the people of the west.</P>
    <P>Dublin is booming to such an extent that people can no longer live in the city. It takes one hour to travel a distance of one mile, yet other parts of the country are not receiving much needed infrastructure and employment. Something is wrong and it is time the Minister exerted pressure on the NRA and other State agencies in an attempt to distribute wealth, jobs and infrastructure fairly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>The league table of non-national roads reveals that County Kildare has done well in recent years. County Wicklow has not done too badly either. However, roads in County Wicklow <Col N="1036" /> are susceptible to certain hardships which roads elsewhere are not.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of the new savings scheme. Many elderly and vulnerable persons who receive pensions continue to lodge them in their local banks without examining their details. It probably costs them money to lodge their pensions in some cases. Perhaps the Minister would arrange for pension slips to be provided which would outline details of the savings scheme. Such schemes often do not come to people's attention, even if they are advertised in national newspapers.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued by one aspect of the Bill. I sought to table an amendment to the Finance Bill following the announcement of the 1998 budget. Section 38 concerned foreign earnings deduction relief for those working abroad, with the exception of those working in the United Kingdom. The Minister imposed an expiry date of 31 December 2003. At the time I sought to have members of the Garda and Defence Forces serving overseas included in the scheme. I am perplexed by the provision's origin and the application of an expiry date, although I was given to understand that it applied to telecommunications workers and those working in Third World countries. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some members of Fine Gael called for the provision of an allowance in regard to the room rental scheme. On the face of it, the provision of a £6,000 allowance seems worthwhile, but it will prove unworkable and the issue may need to be revisited. I note that a 100% capital allowance is to be provided over seven years for rental income set against expenditure on rented accommodation. Many houses have been subdivided for rental purposes and the accommodation is in poor condition. It is only a matter of time before a tragedy occurs as a result of overcrowding. Pressure is being exerted on the housing system with which it does not have the capacity to cope. Section 52 refers to the rural renewal scheme. I am aware that the Minister is doing everything possible to expedite the EU decision on this important scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill includes a provision to deduct mortgage interest relief at source. This is a welcome development. The Minister disagrees, by and large, with State intervention. The housing market is affected by stamp duty, mortgage interest relief and first-time buyer's grants. I agree with the Minister's stance in this area. Fine Gael was the only party which disagreed with the attitude he adopted following the publication of the first and third Bacon reports in regard to mortgage interest relief not being allowed against rental income. Housing supply slowed down as a result of the measures introduced. Neither Independent Members nor other Opposition parties agreed with Fine Gael's stance on the issue. Deputy Noonan was Fine Gael finance spokesman at the time and, together with Deputies Hayes and Enright, indicated the potential adverse con<Col N="1037" /> sequences of the Minister's action. I compliment the Minister for rectifying the situation.</P>
    <P>My colleague called for the extension of the first-time buyer's grant which should be abolished. The grant was introduced in 1987 as a boost to the building trade, not house buyers. The grant was increased to £2,000 in 1993 and it could be in the region of £10,000 to £15,000 now if it had been index-linked. The grant does not benefit anyone. Two thirds of first-time buyers buy second hand houses. We should target all first-time buyers, not one third. Mortgage interest relief should, therefore, be increased. For the first five years of mortgage payments, £54 million is returned by the State to 100,000 mortgage holders. This means that people only receive £500 per annum into their hands. If I hold a mortgage of £100,000 on which interest is charged at 5%, I pay interest of £5,000. I urge the Minister to double mortgage interest relief for the first five or six years of repayment. Stamp duty, which does not yield a huge amount of revenue, should be abolished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome many aspects of the Bill. It has been stated on many occasions since the budget's introduction that the Minister has failed for the third time running to narrow the gap between the rich and poor. The concessions he has made favour those who least need them and penalise those who need them most. The UN human development report, 2000, highlights the fact that of the world's 18 most industrialised countries, Ireland is second last at number 17 in terms of the number living above the poverty line. Only the United States has a worse record on the percentage of its population living in poverty and the United Kingdom is just ahead of Ireland at number 16. That is a terrible indictment and the Minister has done little to change our position.</P>
      <P>Unemployed persons will benefit by £10 per week from the Bill's provisions while those earning £50,000 per annum will benefit to the sum of £49 per week from the Minister's tax concessions. A married couple in receipt of a long-term unemployment payment will benefit by the princely sum of £17 per week. The Minister's thinking is clear.</P>
      <P>Three years ago, the Minister introduced an imaginative and progressive element in his budget in regard to underdeveloped areas. He highlighted the upper Shannon region in particular. Last year and the year before, I asked him to consider extending the pilot scheme to other areas. The scheme has created massive investment potential in the affected areas, but Bacon III has had a very serious impact on that development potential throughout the BMW region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked last year and I ask again if the Minister will extend that to the other areas, particularly the middle Shannon area, from Ballinasloe, through Portumna, to Woodford in East County Galway, my own constituency. We have not had one IDA assisted job in the last 25 years. AT <Col N="1038" /> Cross in Ballinasloe closed down. The record speaks for itself. The Minister and the Government have neglected east Galway. Will he show some anxiety about what is happening in this area by extending this pilot scheme to the middle Shannon region immediately?</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister did on third level education fees. That is only part of an overall problem. In the Minister's own constituency, the university has one of the highest drop-out rates. Why is this so? It is not just one factor like a wrong initial choice by the students in Maynooth or other colleges. It just happens to be one of the worst. Many students cannot maintain themselves on the current £1,700 grant. Will the Minister who controls the purse strings, unlike the other Ministers, increase that figure so that students can maintain themselves without having to work? There are other reports saying that students spend a lot of money on drink or cigarettes. That nonsense must be nailed immediately. Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, to prevent the education system collapsing, double the grant at least in the interim for the students who are now making a decision about third level? That is why we see from the current CAO applications that numbers going into third level education have decreased. It is not because they do not want to go but that they cannot maintain themselves, particularly those in the lower income bracket.</P>

We may need our friends now and again if our worst fears are realised in the present situation here and in Britain. We should be grateful to them and not forget that. The Minister is not an aggressive person but he got himself into that mess.</P>
      <P>The Minister fails to understand the role of the credit unions. They have done vital voluntary work and despite the Celtic tiger they continue to do so. The booming economy is not all inclusive and people still depend on the credit unions and its voluntary work and advice. The high rollers and those on a good income are all right but there are still many on a small income. This must not be forgotten.</P>

    <P>The £45 increase to £90 for the handicapped is welcome, but the withdrawal of the VRT relief was an insult to people who are trying to make something of their lives in difficult circumstances. <Col N="1039" /> Am I correct in saying that the Minister has reversed this?</P>

      <P>The East-West link, the road linking Sligo to the Ceann Comhairle's constituency in Louth has disappeared off the National Roads Authority's drawing board. It is a vital link if we are to develop the BMW region. It is one of the most neglected areas. All the developments are on the east-south-east coast. The Minister must examine this region in terms of balancing the country. I support Deputy Ring in saying that the gas connection from the Mayo coast must come through the BMW region. It stated on television last night that it will go up the south-east coast to the capital. Everything is developed towards this region where you cannot get into or out of the city. I left home at 7.30 a.m. and arrived at the outskirts of Dublin at 10 a.m. and it was 11.05 a.m. when I reached Leinster House from the Clonee by-pass. This city is choked.</P>
      <P>I welcome the over the shop scheme. It is for the large cities like Dublin, Galway and Cork, but not the small provincial town. Why are these towns, which need life too, excluded? We do not want the situation where people lock up shops and go home outside the town leaving the small town or village dead. It is a question of encouraging people to live in the small towns. The Minister is encouraging people to stay in the cities when they want to get out. This is not common sense. This is a good scheme with merit but it is being applied wrongly.</P>
      <P>I also support the case for third level students. They cannot exist on the present allowances. When a child qualifies for a grant, why can an advance payment not be made on the day of enrolment? As I stated before, young people, particularly girls, going to colleges in strange towns find that when they enrol and enter accommodation that the grant is not available until November or December. In the first weeks in a strange town, when they are vulnerable, they must spend their pocket money paying for costly accommodation. The recent drop out figures have been mentioned. These students dropped out but not because they made wrong choices or were socialising. We should not downgrade our young people. They are committed to education but the cost is prohibitive. The State must assist them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall see about that. There are many positive aspects to the Bill but many flaws also and some glaring injustices. Previous speakers referred to a few. There are people who are becoming increasingly disadvantaged each passing year because of the policies that are pursued. This is not a personal but a general statement. As I have said before, the same thing has happened in other economies that pursued the same policies. One example is the interdepartmental committee on the disabled drivers 1994 tax concessions issue that has been sitting on the shelf for three years. Its purpose is to alleviate the burden on people who have a disability and wish to go to work or college at a time when their services are needed. It was possible, and still is, to give them a tax concession on motor vehicles and other items, as others have indicated. The essential issue is that the number who need it exceeds the number receiving it. It should not take so long for the inter-departmental committee to make a decision. The Minister should bring the heads together under the chairmanship of a civil servant from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and ask them to come to a decision that reflects modern times. The situation regarding house prices has gone from a crisis to a tragedy. Many people argue that house prices do not affect inflation because they are not part of the CPI. I believe they do affect the spiral of price inflation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made changes in the past few days, but I do not know if they are welcome. A house for letting in most parts of the greater Dublin area can achieve a rental of about £2,000 per month. It increases with each week and month that passes. The chances of a young couple being able to compete in the marketplace are virtually nil and are decreasing with each passing day. I ask the Minister to make arrangements whereby first time buyers can compete, or else we will have a tragedy on our hands. People are sleeping in the open air because of lack of access to a roof over their heads, which is an awful reflection on society, given the Celtic tiger economy, and on all of us in this House. I have raised this issue before. Everyone talks about it, making passing reference to it, but nothing is being done. The Minister for Finance is the only person who can do something about this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Minister's brilliant fight with our European colleagues at the ECOFIN meeting. The Minister can rightly justify his case relating to our tax regime on the grounds that we lost heavily on our entry into the EU when faced with stiff competition that had not been experienced before. Our European col<Col N="1041" /> leagues have to be reminded of that again and again. Our argument may be seen in some quarters as a reluctance to support the European concept, and if that happens we will have a serious problem on our hands. The Nice agreement has teed us up for a two-speed Europe, which has already been talked about and thought about by our more powerful European colleagues. If that should occur, it would be a disaster for us. Robin Cook, the British Foreign Secretary, boasted on television the other night that in the aftermath of Nice, Britain is now in a stronger position. Britain is just like all the other more powerful economies in Europe.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure to speak in a debate such as this. When history judges this period, people will point to this budget and the Finance Bill that implements it in a practical and forthright way, and this will be seen as the golden period of Irish economic development. For the first time, we see a budget, following in the slipstream of a succession of earlier budgets produced by this Minister, which sets out the course to be taken well into the future. The work of a reforming Minister, who is prepared not only to cut taxes but to reform the taxation system in a radical and improving way, can be seen in this budget.</P>
      <P>Under this Minister, we have seen unrelenting tax cuts, reform and attention to detail, which is what this country needed. Ever since the first tax rally in Dublin in 1979, people have demanded action on taxation, which is the huge besetting, elemental issue which has pervaded and influenced our economy and our political system. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has proved his commitment to reforming the tax system. He has done this in office, and advocated it in opposition and in difficult circumstances within our party. He excited the enmity of some within our party because of his reforming zeal, but I have always supported him. When many condemned him on the matter of individualisation, I was prepared to defend him fulsomely.</P>

Never one to shy away from a little carping, there is a homily from Deputy Quinn buried in the middle, speaking of how the budget is not good for the disadvantaged. The overall impression from this leaflet is that the Labour Party has cottoned on that this is a very good budget, that there is no harm in telling people just how good it is and letting them in on the secret that they will be better off as a result of this budget.</P>

      <P>Deputy Durkan seems to be wilfully ignoring the figures that indicate that the social gap is being narrowed, not widened. Hundreds of thousands of people have been taken out of the tax net altogether, which is a huge and profound achievement of this and the last three budgets. I was intrigued by the remarks of Deputies Durkan and Boylan regarding the European reprimand. I am not a Euro-sceptic and never have been. I worked for the European <Col N="1043" /> Commission when I was living in London, conducting economic research on the impact that Europe had on the United Kingdom. Being a member of the EU, or EC or EEC as it used to be, does not mean that one suspends one's critical faculties. While Europe has had a benign and positive influence, economically and socially, it is important that we recognise that everything that emanates from Brussels is not necessarily good. Fine Gael is the most slavishly pro-European party in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not. It is time people were forthright and honest about their views on this country's relationship with Brussels. The Minister was courageous. He is not lacking when it comes to courage and, if necessary, facing down public opinion and the cosy consensus on how we should never upset people in Brussels. It is important to upset them from time to time, to argue our case hard and to push matters to the limit. Rather than challenge, insult or attack the wonderful bureaucrats in Brussels, the Minister merely indicated a few hard facts about this economy and his role in its development. Those hard facts are unpalatable not only to those opposite who must maintain some semblance of an Opposition, but to others.</P>

      <P>The Government made those decisions and we stand by them. Fianna Fáil made a solemn promise during the 1997 general election campaign to reduce personal taxation to 20% and 40% if economic circumstances permitted. I hope by the end of this year the Government will be in a position to lower the higher rate to 40% and fulfil our solemn pledge to the maximum. That is a good approach, it is both egalitarian and the right way to proceed. Some argue that lowering the higher tax rate means helping the better-off, but that is not necessarily the case. The figures show that middle to higher income earners provide the volume of Exchequer revenue that flows from taxation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has shown a reforming zeal in reforming the tax system which has been expressed not only in the pursuit of individualisation, but in the various measures he is taking to tackle the vexed issue of PRSI. I hope he will carry it forward to the next budget and give the matter serious consideration. IBEC is upset about provisions in the budget, but if it takes a long-term view, the prospects are much better, particularly if the entire regime is reformed.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill which marks an extension of the budget debate. The majority of schemes and the detail of the Bill have great merit. Previous speakers referred to taxation. The Minister has introduced tax reform during his term of office. A professional informed me that in 1986, taking various schemes into account, he paid tax at the rate of 72p in the pound. I am glad that the position has changed and those working extremely hard can consider the money earned by them as their own.</P>

Many elderly persons who left Ireland in more difficult times draw a pension of one type or another in England and on their return comment on how well off pensioners are here due to the various schemes introduced from the late 1960s onwards.</P>
    <P>I welcome the innovative special savings scheme announced in the Bill. In recent days we have heard that the private sector borrowed approximately £25 billion last year. This will help to take some of the steam out of the market. The point has been made repeatedly that people are focused on spending and there is no incentive to save. At many meetings over the weekend, people from all sectors of society, including low paid workers, welcomed the scheme and said they would put money into it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the taxation concessions for disabled drivers, in 1994, when the Taoiseach was the Minister for Finance, a tax exemption was given to people with disabilities. To qualify for the primary medical certificate, a person had to be without the use of one or both limbs. It is a worthwhile scheme and I understand an interdepartmental commission is reviewing it. It should be widened. People with conditions such as Down's Syndrome and autism qualify under the disabled passenger's scheme, but its provisions must be examined. I work closely with a group in north Cork called Cabhair, which involves the parents of mentally handicapped children. I have heard many stories about incidents in cars when parents have been driving to various places. The lack of restraints and other appliances in cars creates dangers. I appeal to the Minister and the Government to consider this matter closely because it concerns me greatly.</P>
    <P>Self-employed people who joined the PRSI system in 1988 and who paid contributions for up to nine years do not qualify for a contributory pension because they do not have ten years worth of contributions. People who contribute for more than ten years qualify for such a pension. The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Government put a scheme in place in 1998 under which such individuals would be granted a <i>pro rata</i> pension. If a person has paid up to nine years worth of contributions, is there any possibility that he or she could be paid nine tenths of a pension? I appreciate there are difficulties but the matter should be examined.</P>
    <P>Some 102 towns have been designated under the town renewal scheme. EU approval for the commercial and industrial elements is awaited and I hope that will come through shortly. However, a case can be made for re-examining elements of the designations in towns. For example, some of the properties that should have been designated in Charleville and Kanturk in my constituency were overlooked. It may be necessary to establish an appeals board or redraft the entire measure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> I am delighted the economy is doing so well. I spoke to young people who did the leaving certificate examination last year or who are doing it this year and when I did the examination in the mid-1980s, there was none of the confidence that exists now. I hope this confidence continues.</P>
    <P>In the context of the debate on the Private Notice Questions earlier, I hope everything possible is done to prevent an outbreak of foot and mouth disease here. The Government and the Minister are doing everything in their power to ensure the disease is kept out of the country. I appeal to all citizens to do the same because it is their civic duty to ensure the country remains disease free.</P>

      <P>Approximately five years ago, the Fianna Fáil Party started to prepare a comprehensive taxation policy for implementation when we returned to power. The policy was refined before the party came into office, but the measures implemented by the Minister for Finance over the past two years are 99% those prepared while we were in Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals were based on an overall assessment of what was needed to stimulate business activity while rewarding work. The policy document included a proposal to introduce tax cuts aimed at reducing the top rate of tax to 44% and the standard rate to 20%. The 20% target will be reached this year while the top rate will fall to 42%. We also planned to reduce the rate of capital gains tax because many properties were not being utilised due to the penal tax rate involved. In most cases the individuals who owned the properties would not be considered wealthy. They may have been left small properties which subsequently increased in value. However, it was not worth paying a tax of up to 60%. My party considered there was a need to free up such properties in towns, villages and cities and the policy has worked. The party also considered the role of semi-State bodies and whether they should be privatised. This process is ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years, I have been interested in ensuring the taxation system was changed to a tax credit system. The report by Miriam Hederman outlined that people at the lower end of the income tax scale would benefit most from such a system as they would get proportionally higher benefits from changes to tax allowances. I am glad this has been adopted and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, deserves great credit for pushing this change. The Minister should also be complimented on the special savings scheme. There is a <Col N="1048" /> need for a scheme that will give real returns to individuals and energise them in relation to saving. The Minister's scheme will encourage people to put money aside.</P>
    <P>Share options schemes are important because they encourage people to put energy into and have an interest in their work. People who have taken part is such schemes in the past have proved to be energetic and honest workers. Previously, capital gains tax arose on any chargeable gain on the sale and an income tax rate of 44% also applied on the difference between the option price and the market price. It was a penal system and the Minister has changed it to a situation where only capital gains on the sale will arise. This will ensure people remain interested in working in their industries.</P>
    <P>The success of the Government's taxation policies in recent years is obvious in every area. The situation I find myself in is similar to a child going into a sweet shop, but finding it difficult to make a choice because there are so many goodies on offer. That there were 288,000 people taken out of the tax net over the past two or three years proves that the policies of the Government are working. The number of people who have gone back to work and the numbers of people who are now able to afford to take holidays, buy cars and make improvements to their houses provide proof that the policies being pursued by the Government are working.</P>
    <P>We can speak about the difficulties. There are difficulties and it is a challenge to the Government to face these and to help those who are left behind. Some people will always be left behind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton attacked the Minister on the credit unions. However, the Minister has reached agreement with the credit unions and they have put into operation what was acceptable to both sides.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell has taken over as finance spokesperson for the Fine Gael Party. He started off energetically. He wants to change the whole system again. Previously he succeeded in sinking the merchant navy spectacularly and if he continues the way he has started, he will do the same with the nation if he is ever put in charge of the tiller.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I compliment the Minister on the changes he has made in the taxation area over the past four or five years. They are to be welcomed. Tax reductions and the widening of the tax bands have certainly improved the take home pay of many people. As Deputy Ahern said, more than 280,000 were taken out of the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in this House when there were hard decisions taken, there was a penal taxation system and there was certainly no incentive to work. I am glad that in recent years this has changed. We now find that large numbers of people are returning to work and there more people than ever in employment. That must be of benefit to the country generally because it brings in more <Col N="1049" /> tax and more wealth and it ensures the Government has a substantial amount of money with which to play around.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recognised the need to give incentives in this area. I welcome the new tax-based savings scheme. At a time when there is a tendency to spend it is important for people to do as the Minister has done on occasions, that is, put money by for the rainy day. The new saving schemes will encourage many young people and people who are not so young, to start a savings plan and get a generous reward for doing so after five years. It is an innovative scheme which gives an incentive to people to save. It should be welcomed by all sides of the House and I am sure it will be.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes to the mobility allowance because I felt the decision taken initially was not in the best interests of people with a disability. However, the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme needs to be seriously looked at because it is too prohibitive. As Members will be aware, to qualify for the primary medical certificate one must fit the criteria. If one's circumstances do not fit neatly into the box provided on the form, one is ineligible. We all have come across cases where people, who are severely handicapped and physically challenged, do not qualify for the primary medical certificate and as a result do not qualify for concessions under the scheme. I understand the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, and the Minister for Finance are working on this and a working group was set up some time ago to make recommendations. I hope we will receive its report and recommendations in this area as quickly as possible. Too many people are being denied the concessions applicable to disabled drivers and passengers and as a result these physically challenged people are not able to meet their transport needs. It is important that this would be changed. Recently I came across the case of a person who lost his arm, part of his hand and part of his knee and yet when he went before the medical examiner he was told that he was not physically challenged enough to qualify for any of the tax concessions. That is appalling. I would ask the Minister to speed up the report and make the changes to ensure that these people are looked after as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity that a debate as important as this is squeezed into a few hours like this. It is an entirely inappropriate use of Dáil time that an attempt should be made to restrict the debate in this fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I forget, I will make two quick points. When I came into the House, I heard Deputy Moynihan mention Irish emigrants. Given the contribution of Irish emigrants, I find it remarkable that we are not doing more for those who left here in the 1950s and 1960s when the econ<Col N="1050" /> omy was in very different shape, many of whom are in ill health and in poor circumstances in London. We now have the money. There is a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to set up a task force to look at this issue but, as yet, it has not even been put in place. That is a great pity and I urge the Minister to set it up.</P>
    <P>The second matter is that the House may not be aware that a statement has been issued this evening by the Minister for Finance. I was going to say that it announces the date of the general election but it amounts, I think, to the same thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It states that 5 December 2001 will be budget day. The Minister has told us on several occasions that it would be in October. I do not know why it will be on 5 December and why he chooses to announce it today.</P>
      <P>There is something in the statement which all Deputies in marginal constituencies, that is, most of us, should take into account. He says that around the end of February 2002, the budget day tax changes will be put into effect and, where relevant, this will involve a once-off correction payment to cover any arrears from 1 January 2002. In terms of the tax and social welfare, there will be a correction payment which will arrive eight, nine or ten weeks into the year. Unless one is being very gravely misled, that is about as broad a hint as one can get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt it will be in euro.</P>
      <P>There are positive measures in this Bill and it could not be otherwise, given the unique surplus available to the Minister in this case. I give the Minister credit for those positive measures but in reading the Bill it is impossible to escape the conclusion that huge benefits are being conferred on certain wealthy interests in keeping with the Minister's avowed political bias in his three previous Finance Acts.</P>
      <P>If I might concentrate on one of them in the limited time available to me, nothing betrays more the money bias of the Minister for Finance and the Government than the blatant abandonment of the measures previously announced to cause the release of hoarded land for house building purposes and to assist first time buyers. It is an action blatantly dismissive of the interests of the average citizen and unashamedly designed to benefit a small number of builders and developers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the Minister who told us that the housing crisis was being aggravated by the kind of developer who calculatedly hoarded land and drip fed it into the market. The Minister said that therefore he was persuaded to extend the halving of capital gains tax to residential land but on what became known as the &ldquo;20/60 basis&rdquo;, in other words, developers who refused to release the land <Col N="1051" /> for house building purposes would be subject from next year to a 60% punitive rate of CGT. This would have been a significant incentive to increase the housing output at a time of acute need. Without warning, but with the full support and knowledge of his Cabinet colleagues according to the Taoiseach on the Order of Business this morning, the Minister for Finance came into the House today to announce that he had reversed this measure. The type of developers who manipulate the market in the manner described by the Minister for Finance two years ago have been given the green light to resume their selfish agenda. What is inexplicable is that the Minister has made this announcement 15 months in advance. Surely if he were serious about tackling supply side problems he would have done two things &ndash; he would not have announced any change in strategy until the next Finance Bill and, in any event, he would have made clear that the rate would revert to the original 40%. The 20% rate was a favoured one, the purpose of which, the Minister said, was to release land for residential building purposes. Now there is no reversion to the original 40% rate but a maintenance of the favoured 20% rate for reasons known only to the Minister.</P>
    <P>At a time when people on reasonable incomes cannot afford a mortgage and landlords force tenants on to the streets through rent increases, these measures are a disgrace. A 20% measure introduced as an incentive to help these people has now become a permanent measure to enrich people who have already become immensely wealthy in the boom of the past seven or eight years. The Minister has implemented the measures in the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector which benefit landlords, but the Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill, which promises measures to benefit tenants, will not be published until summer 2002. This is an outrage my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, has sought to highlight for more than two years. In the interim, the Minister responsible for the Bill, Deputy Dempsey, gives priority to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill to permit Ray Burke-type expenditure in the forthcoming general election.</P>
    <P>I have some of the most harrowing constituency cases where rent hikes by landlords force tenants to become homeless, and these people must then live in the forlorn hope that the local authority will house them. I will mention two cases I had last week and I will give the details to the Minister to protect the confidentiality of those involved. A separated man with a 13 year old daughter told me he is going hungry. He works and pays rent on a house in Tallaght. The landlord is seeking to hike the rent for the third time and the man cannot make ends meet. He does not qualify for a housing subsidy and has no prospect of being housed.</P>
    <P>The second case is of a woman who returned 12 months ago from a British city where she had <Col N="1052" /> lived for 15 years. She rented a house in my constituency and the landlord announced a 100% hike in the rent. That woman must pay £800 for a poorly kept, poor quality, three bedroomed house. She is awaiting an operation and cannot pay the rent. The landlord owns 12 houses in the greater Tallaght area. That woman faces homelessness if the local authority does not house her, which is not a likely prospect.</P>
    <P>At a single stroke the Minister for Finance has abolished the 2% anti-speculation tax, reduced stamp duty from 9% to 3% and halved the traditional capital gains tax on residential land. The point of the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector was that a balanced approach was necessary but the Minister has ignored the tenant friendly measures proposed in the report and implemented the measures which benefit landlords.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy McDowell, that moneyed interests have had their way with the Minister. House building is slowing down in the greater Dublin area and decreased by almost 3% last year. Despite that, the Minister told the House that the Government has decided not to proceed with the anti-speculative property tax next April &ldquo;in light of developments in the housing market since last summer&rdquo;. What developments does the Minister have in mind? I hope he does not believe that, just because the rate of price acceleration for trophy houses in desirable areas has stabilised, ordinary citizens' aspirations for a home of their own is any more realisable now than it was last summer.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to the example given by the Minister. How he could perpetrate such a cruel deception in his speech and maintain a straight face is beyond me. He said:</P>
    <P>The Government has taken a range of measures over recent years to ensure [that it deals with the price of houses]. The Government is also concerned to ensure there is a supply of good standard accommodation in the private rented sector. The [Finance] Bill provides for various tax incentives announced by Government arising out of the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector.</P>
    <P>The point is that the only measures from the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector the Minister proposes to implement are those favourable to landlords. None of the measures which guarantee an element of security, standards, fixity of rents or anything similar is dealt with in the Bill. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, whose task it is to deal with housing, tells us the Bill to deal with those matters will be published in the summer of 2002.</P>
    <P>That is a disgrace and can only lead to the conclusion that it is a &ldquo;scratch my back and I'll scratch your back&rdquo; arrangement between the Government and some developers. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has succeeded in convincing <Col N="1053" /> most of the public that he has nothing to do with housing policy and that the real Minister with responsibility for housing is someone called Peter Bacon. Meanwhile, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is focused on how to get more spend for Fianna Fáil in the next general election. The question arises as to where this extra £1 million for Fianna Fáil will come. The answer is that it will come from some of the largest beneficiaries of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Reading through the Bill, one is struck by how it is characterised by relief after relief. There are reliefs for health insurance, rent a room, living over the shop, rural dwellings and even paltry relief for trade union contributions. That is the point of the clientelism philosophy behind the network of reliefs. Even trade unions will be on board because of this welcome but modest and, in the great scale of fiscal policy, inconsequential relief. Such an approach to taxation flies in the face of all literature from the time of the Commission on Taxation and serves mainly to water the grassroots and complicate the tax system.</P>
    <P>I cite section 30 as an example. Its purported role is to give tax relief on interest on borrowings to purchase, improve or repair certain rented properties referred to as pre-1963. In the current environment, I can see the point of facilitating the restoration, repair and modernisation of these pre-1963 dwellings, but I am damned if I can understand the logic of facilitating tax breaks on borrowings to purchase them. What is the point other than facilitating wealthy interests to use their capital gains tax reliefs to buy these properties, keep prices high and push rents to a level that is fast becoming, and has already become in many parts of Dublin, unaffordable?</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Ahern said this was a 99% Fianna Fáil Finance Bill. I do not know how the newly self-proclaimed social democrats of the Progressive Democrats take to being treated to the remaining 1% of the Bill. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the Bill will widen the gap between the wealthy and the average citizen. The Labour Party showed how two thirds of the Minister's spend in his give-away tax package on budget day could have been focused in a manner which would have contributed more to real tax reform and would have targeted and benefited the low to average taxpayer. That was not done and, I believe, it was not done deliberately. That is true of most of the measures introduced in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The share options scheme is a marvellous idea. A number of Fianna Fáil backbenchers referred to Ireland as a share-owning democracy and spoke of how this scheme will make shareholders of us all. The scheme is structured in such a fashion as to primarily benefit executives and managerial people. While the harmonising regime for deposit takers under the savings scheme, which is universally welcomed as a good thing, seems very attractive on the surface, it gives rise to some concern regarding the freedom to transfer moneys from non-incentivised <Col N="1054" /> schemes to this one. If its purpose was to mop up money out of the economy and to encourage people who may not be in the habit of saving to save, why not restrict it to them? Why facilitate, as happened with SSAs a few years ago, people to transfer moneys from other areas to this scheme? It is not necessarily proven that it will be a non-inflationary measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the amount of time allowed to speak on the Finance Bill is extremely limited. I will make a few points which strike me, and would strike anybody, who looked at the budget closely.</P>
      <P>Who will be celebrating when this Finance Bill is passed at 10 p.m. tonight? There is one group of people who will undoubtedly be celebrating, the speculative group, as Deputy Rabbitte referred to them, who sit on building land which enjoys planning permission but which they refuse to release or on land which has been zoned but for which they refuse to seek planning permission. They might have looked forward to paying 40% capital gains tax one year, they might have enjoyed paying it at the rate of 20% another year and then faced, if one was to believe the great bible of the current Government on the housing crisis, the Bacon reports 1, 2 and 3, a capital gains tax regime of 60%. They will not now pay capital gains tax at the rate of 60%. In addition, those who might have felt they would be affected by the 2% speculative tax will not pay it. Those who own many rental properties now face the most attractive regime to encourage them to buy more.</P>
      <P>This budget, when one looks at those measures, cannot be described by any fair-minded person interested in housing as little less than a speculators charter. It is a matter of fundamental disgrace that local authority applicants are being told, for the first time since the 1970s, they will not be offered accommodation for at least five years. Rents have escalated and land which should be released for building purposes is not being released. It is that group of speculators who will celebrate at 10 p.m. tonight having received the finest give-away ever from a Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>It is at the same time a slap in the face to all those voluntary organisations and socially minded people who drew attention to the housing crisis, who are aware of the number of homeless people, who are aware of the number of people on the housing lists who have abandoned any prospect of putting a roof over their heads. I want to try to tease out what the Minister for Finance is trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dangerous side of this Bill and the short discussion on it is that some of the Minister's fundamental assumptions of financial strategy might not be adequately addressed. He proudly said on &ldquo;Later with O'Leary&rdquo; the other night that the Government was right of centre. The Minister smiled wryly at the reference to an article in the <i>British Telegraph </i>of Tuesday, 13 February 2001 <Col N="1055" /> describing him as the Celtic Thatcher. It said: &ldquo;Celtic Thatcher takes on Brussels&rdquo;. The Minister sat back and gave one of his little smiles. In a way he is setting up the parameters of the forthcoming election. People should think long and hard about this Government. This speculative class to which the Minister has tied himself, the people who have done more than anyone else to enhance their greedy desire, have also shattered political confidence in this country. They are the ones responsible for offering various types of carrier bags and envelopes to the Fianna Fáil Party and for bringing them before the tribunals.</P>
    <P>I hope the public think long and hard about who they will support. Do they want more of this McCreevyism, none of it startlingly original? We have heard much of it before. The Minister spoke about taking money at the top rate of tax from those who can well afford to pay it, those who are enjoying all the concessions under the various schemes. His description of taking tax from these people is, &ldquo;I am giving them back their own money&rdquo;. That phrase was used by Mrs. Thatcher in Britain. That is ignorance and there is no economic basis for it. Speculators made their money from an economy into which people put their sweat and blood, into which hundreds and thousands of millions of pounds was invested by Irish taxpayers over the years. Do they pay education costs, the costs of infrastructure, the costs of the health system? Of course, they do not but the Minister chooses to take up this little populist piece of rubbish and say, &ldquo;I am giving them back their own money&rdquo;. This kind of folksy ignorance, without a shred of serious economic basis to it, is precisely what the mad baroness in Britain came out with.</P>
    <P>I thought the day would never come when I would say perhaps the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> got it right. It would have been different &ndash; and we are expected to say how it might have been different &ndash; if one approached the relationship between economy and society from a different set of assumptions. If it had been approached from a rights perspective, one would have arrived at the conclusion that at a time of unimaginable surpluses one could narrow the gap between that range of provisions that are available in every other European country, those countries which operate higher tax regimes but which enjoy public parks, different kinds of amenities, child care provision, which have first-class health services and public transport, none of which we have. Instead of saying he will use the surpluses to lift the life of our citizens to some kind of provision in the public space, the Minister comes out with these little trite pieces of British ignorance of the worst kind, &ldquo;I am giving the people back their own money&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope people see how that rights approach has been entirely discarded. I heard of a case of a person who attended the Regional Hospital in Galway and went home untreated after 18 hours. When the person returned the next day he saw <Col N="1056" /> 30 people lying on trolleys awaiting treatment. Is that the way to treat people? Is it fair to tell people who need a house they have to wait five years for one? The remark, &ldquo;there are always people who will have to be lifted up&rdquo; was made in this House today. A Deputy described the Irish economy as something like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, &ldquo;It's so good we do not know what to spend it on, holidays abroad, cars, whatever&rdquo;. This is so offensive to a country which desperately needs to restore social cohesion and which needs social solidarity, which should be using its surpluses to say a person's right to a decent health service, a house, to travel safely in old age, to live in a proper environment is a right. There are no rights, there are only concessions.</P>
    <P>The principal group who get concessions in this budget are the speculators who, as I said, have a unique identity. Every one of those who attached themselves to those now being investigated for corruption were people from that speculative class. They drove a stake into the heart of Irish democracy and instead of that connection being broken, the Minister rewards them almost without their asking for it. Our colleague in Galway West, Deputy Molloy, as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with special responsibility for housing, spent about a year and a half standing on his hind legs saying we had no housing crisis and that the Bacon reports would solve all. Now the Bacon reports are discarded and no reasons are given why the members of the lobby which counts, which always counted and which always had a monopoly on the corruption and who knew where to go, are those who benefited. He will not have to come with a mask over his face to go into the tent at Galway races next year.</P>
    <P>There are a few important points in relation to this. In 1955, 55,000 people left this country. They are now elderly and would like to come home, many to the places they left in much harder times. However, they cannot dream of coming back due to the housing shortage. There is something incredibly deadly about the morality of a country that accepts that something as basic as a roof over one's head can become the basis of speculative reward. It is time we built houses and when local authorities are slow to do it to establish a housing authority that will build them within a timescale to enable the State to offer houses.</P>
    <P>It is part of the madness of this new version of ourselves as prisoners of the economy rather than as members of the society that the Tánaiste can say she will bring 200,000 people into the country because the economy needs them. Fine, but where are they to live? What about the housing needs of the entire population? She would say, rather like old Friedrich von Hayek who, as Mrs. Thatcher mentioned in many of her lectures afterwards, used to say, &ldquo;Prime Minister, the markets will do it for you &ndash; be patient and the markets will do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those engaged in every civilised economic discourse in any of the academies I know at present <Col N="1057" /> could tell the Minister that there are things the market cannot do. It cannot give you universality in health, it cannot give you universality in housing and it cannot give you universality in education. That is why there is a barbarous ignorance to this kind of logic that informs his decisions.</P>
    <P>He pushed when it came to individualisation but when those of us who say that a woman has the right to choose whether to rear her children for a few years or that she be driven into the economy, we are supposed to be old fashioned. All we say is that one should not be penalised for choosing to want to look after one's children and to be with them at a time when society is torn apart by this ridiculous kind of selfish economics. That is all we asked the Minister yet he drives on his individualisation tax proposals as something that is supposed to be an automatic benefit, something progressive and when the markets are finished it will all be all right. It will not be all right.</P>
    <P>The test of a budget or a Finance Bill is in the kind of country we create with it and what kind of life we want from it. Do we want the Tánaiste saying not just the 200,000 but also pointing to those who had gone out on retirement suggesting we bring them back as well. Why should we bring them back? Not to ensure that they might have a better standard of living or that they might have some enjoyment in old age, but because the economy needs them. That is why I use the phrase &ldquo;prisoners of the economy&rdquo;. This is the deadly right wing logic of a Minister who, on Olivia O'Leary's programme, said he is proud to be a member of one of the only right of centre Governments in Europe and looks disparagingly at those who enjoy child care, good education, public transport, public parks and safety that are available in Europe.</P>
    <P>The mentor, the Tánaiste, gives us her occasional insights into what she thinks we should be doing. She thinks that, for example, a country that probably pays no tax is a good thing. We are all willing to be taxed to provide the kind of country that will give dignity in old age, a good health service and provide an education that will give people chances.</P>
    <P>There is a gap between those who are doing best under these tax concessions and those who are at the other end of the scale and as that gap widens it is markedly insulting to tell the latter they are defective people who will catch up when the benefits of the booming economy gets to them. When we examine this Bill and the thinking in it we see a clear division. There are those who are followers of a market model that suggests the people can drag themselves after it but who will make it efficient and will run it the way they do now and will to give back to those who pay most and there are others who suggest that this model is inimical to the public interests. It will shatter social cohesion and will drive bigger wedges between the gaps already in society and tragically it will not give us something we had the opportunity to have for the first time. We could <Col N="1058" /> have had a first class education service or a first class health service. We could be building tens of thousands of houses. We could have driven the speculators back into their place. We could have a happy country. We could have been talking about shortening the working week and the working day or increased holidays but we cannot do any of it as we have been condemned to prison by this ridiculous, nonsensical, right wing and ignorance based system of running the economy of which this Finance Bill is just instalment four.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Maloney and Pat Carey.</P>
      <P>As we are all aware, the implementation of the provisions of the Bill will bring into effect the decisions taken by the Government in the budget of December last. That budget was one of the most innovative not only of taxation reform but also reform across a range of social welfare programmes. It was a budget which ensured that the less well off and disadvantaged in our society were given more social protection and financial support.</P>
      <P>Looking at the provisions of the Bill it will ensure that all employees will be better off when the budget 2001 tax measures come into effect in April this year. PAYE taxpayers, particularly from the middle income earning bracket, will be the primary beneficiaries of the income tax changes in the Bill. The economic turnabout is a success story when one considers that nine years ago, in 1992, unemployment was over 16%, immigration was still prevalent and income tax rates were high.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the national pension reserve fund was a highly innovative move. It will guarantee, as our population ages, that we will be able to meet our future public pensions bill. Merryl Lynch, a leading US bank, has carried out a survey within the EU on the state of pension policies within the EU. Ireland tops the league for the support it gives to the reform of our public pension programmes and also tops the league for the financial support given to pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation is falling and is measured to the harmonised basis. It has fallen from 6% in November to 4.6% in December and is now at only 3.9%. The introduction of the new savings scheme, which is included in the Bill, will help to further reduce inflation. It is also an innovative measure designed to promote savings in our society. This new savings scheme will encourage substantial and regular saving among the population in general. It will be assisted by a top-up to net savings of 25% by the State from tax revenues. This is equivalent to a tax credit of 20%. The scheme will commence in May and savers will be asked to save for five years and it will be open for one year for those who wish to participate in it. We must always support savings policies. Reform of the pension programme is important but the implementation of new savings schemes will enable people to have access to more money as they grow older. The encourage<Col N="1059" /> ment of a regular savings programme can only have positive results.</P>
    <P>The key aspect of the Finance Bill is that many people will have reduced income tax bills. We have enjoyed economic progress but we must ensure that lower and middle income earners are not penalised with higher income tax bills. The changes announced by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will help to substantially reduce the income tax bill for all families and significantly improve the take-home pay of all taxpayers. Under these changes no worker will pay tax on the first £144 earned per week, while the lower rate of tax will be reduced by 2p from 22p to 20p and the higher rate will be reduced by 2p from 44p to 42p.</P>
    <P>I will give some practical examples of the effects of the income tax changes. A single taxpayer earning £12,500 per year will gain up to £42 per month in take-home pay, while a married couple earning £20,000 per year will gain up to £71 per month in take-home pay and a married couple earning £25,000 per year will gain up to £86 per month in take-home pay. A married couple on one income of £16,000 and four children will gain as much as £135 per month. In addition, 133,000 people will be removed fully from the tax net. These reductions will cost £1.2 billion and will ensure that 1.2 million taxpayers will be better off.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant widening of the standard rate tax band, cutting to 23% the number of taxpayers on the top rate of income tax when exempt cases are included. One of the criticisms of the taxation code was that too many people earning average incomes were forced to pay tax at the higher rate, which was 44% prior to the budget. The widening of the standard rate band from £14,000 to £17,000 will ensure that only 23% of the population will pay tax at the higher rate. I am confident the Government will continue its policy of widening tax bands in the next budget to ensure that fewer people pay tax at 42%.</P>
    <P>On a broader level, self-assessment for non-PAYE workers has proven to be a success. However, the Minister for Finance has announced that after 13 years of self-assessment there will be a pay and file system of income tax self-assessment with one key deadline in the annual tax calendar instead of three deadlines. Other tax changes announced in the budget are also highly innovative. The reductions in indirect taxation, including the VAT rate, has helped the Government's anti-inflation programme. These include the introduction of tax relief on trade union subscriptions, an exemption from tax income of the £6,000 derived from the rental of rooms in a person's principal private residence and an extension of tax relief for health insurance to cover premia for primary health care. From April 2002 medical insurance relief will be given at source, while permanent health insurance relief will be given on a net pay basis. From last January <Col N="1060" /> mortgage interest relief has also been given at source,</P>
    <P>I support the provisions in the Finance Bill as they will help the less well off and lower and middle income earners. This is part of the broader Government strategy to reduce income tax burdens which are now one of the lowest in the European Union. I commend the provisions of the Bill to Members as they are a fair and balanced set of proposals which help to promote economic and social justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to a number of contributions. Speakers have pointed out areas where further concessions or allowances could be provided for in Finance Bills. I support these points.</P>
      <P>I listened with particular interest to the contribution of Deputy Higgins who is passionate in his beliefs. He has been a Member of the House for a number of years and impatience might be one of the reasons for his speech. We all wish to see greater changes introduced, but the Celtic Tiger economy was only born a few years ago and the Government is dealing with most of the issues, albeit in a fashion which might not be accepted across the board.</P>
      <P>The Government has lived up to the commitments it gave prior to the last general election. Far too often parties made pledges which were forgotten in year two or three. I am pleased that the Minister for Finance has recognised the commitments we made and has confirmed once again in the budget the Government's sound management of the economy over the past years. It is fair to recognise that some of the provisions in the Bill have been included as a result of commitments made to lobby groups.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reductions in the tax rates and the increases in the allowances. If I remember correctly, this was the most serious issue facing the country in 1997. A commitment was given in the election manifesto and programme for Government that recognition would be given to the over-burdened taxpayer over five budgets. I also welcome the increase in the carer's allowance. However, as a Government backbencher I wish to see further increases. I do not want to pay lip service to carers. They play a leading role in society and I recognise that monetary compensation will never be enough to repay them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the share option scheme and the provisions relating to giving tax relief at source and the tax relief for third level fees. The Bill will increase the housing supply. Others may contradict me, but time will prove this. The Minister has listened to those who made submissions in relation to charitable donations. I welcome the provision dealing with the write-off period for the wear and tear of capital allowances. The reductions in the VAT rates, which have already had an anti-inflationary effect, must be welcomed. This is further evidence that the Minister has listened to those who made submissions. I also welcome the new savings scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> In our election manifesto we promised to reduce the personal taxation rates. The Minister has long been an advocate of low tax rates. One must recognise that the cornerstone of the Minister's policy has always been the reduction of tax rates. Despite criticism, he has argued that lowering tax rates can and does increase revenue. This cannot be contradicted. He has been proven correct in reducing the rate of capital gains tax from 40% to 20% which has resulted in more revenue and, more importantly, in greater economic activity. The increases in personal allowances and the reduction in tax rates are aiding the economy in a number of ways. It is more worthwhile for people to take up work and thereby reduce pressure on social welfare costs. They also give workers an opportunity to retain more of their hard-earned salaries and this encourages a sense of ownership of the economic success which we enjoy as a nation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is introducing the favourable employer share option scheme. Employers and employees have requested these concessions so they can all share in the economic success of a company. Some 70% of employees must avail of the scheme. Employers complain that they are unable to retain employees in this competitive market but schemes such as this will serve to attract and retain employees. Obviously they will be motivated to develop the companies for which they work. Their work is an investment in the company and in themselves. The 70% threshold will bring home to employers and employees that employees have an integral part to play in the success of that company.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the increases provided for the carer's allowance in the Social Welfare Bill some time ago. I welcome the provisions in this regard in the Finance Bill, 2001. The allowance for those who employ a carer to look after a relative has been increased from £8,500 to £10,000 per annum. The provision that allows medical claims directly from designated relatives is welcome. Many families will also welcome the Minister's approval to extend relief to cover education, psychologists and speech therapists.</P>
    <P>In regard to the relief for trade union subscriptions, we all recognise that unions have played a major part in our economic success, through successive partnership agreements. This simple provision gives something back to trade union members. The provision also supports union membership which has been declining and will be recognised as a step to halt that decline. By way of tax relief at source the tax code is a complicated and cumbersome system. Any effort that reduces the administrative burden on the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners is welcome. If the reduction on the administrative burden can be coupled with the benefit to the taxpayer at source it is welcome. PAYE workers pay as they earn and it is only right and proper that they should receive benefits as they pay.</P>
    <P>The extension of medical relief to cover premia for primary health care will make an important <Col N="1062" /> difference for those who have to pay for medical expenses. Obviously people should not be punished for receiving medical care. By way of the child care benefit in kind, the Government is doing much for child care across a wide range of Departments; the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is funding a huge expansion in a number of child care places throughout the country. This provision will further encourage employers to provide child care facilities for workers. The Tánaiste has worked hard to develop family friendly work practices.</P>
    <P>The abolition of third level fees helped to ensure increased participation in universities and colleges. It reduced the burden on families trying to fund their children's education. The increased participation extends to students studying abroad and taking part in graduate courses in the US. The Minister is now extending relief to fees for overseas and post-graduate courses. He has done this as a result of requests on Committee Stage which proves the Minister was listening.</P>
    <P>The Government is facing the challenge of improving housing supply across every constituency. The Finance Bill is only part of that work. We all know the housing supply has be increased.</P>
    <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Carey and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputies Higgins and Rabbitte that we do not have sufficient time to debate this Bill. I would love the opportunity to have an extended debate to explore the dissertation from Deputy Higgins. I am not sure whether he thought he was on the back of a lorry in Eyre Square or in the hallowed halls of NUI, Galway, but I would love to explore his notion of social solidarity and his lectures to us on sensitivity and so on. I would love to examine how he can stand over being a member of a Government in which his president, Deputy De Rossa, gave a miserly £1.80 per week to social welfare recipients a few budgets ago. Will Deputy Higgins tell me honestly how he can stand over the decision of the then Minister for Education to abolish third level fees? Such a signal of social solidarity I have not seen. I would like to hear him comment on the report from the Higher Education Authority last week on the huge drop-out rates from third level education because the supports had not been put in place by the universities and the need for universities and third level colleges to introduce capitation grants which is fees by another name. The constituency I represent and certainly part of the one represented by Deputy Higgins has not benefited one iota from that measure.</P>

      <P>The Deputy talked about health. The Government of which he was a member presided over a policy which used the long arm of the law to prosecute dying people. Surely that is not sensitivity. His colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, was Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology and had the high chair around the Cabinet table. He drip fed little grants here and there for educational and scientific research. He took everything out of Citywest Business Park. The Deputy talked about speculators and developers. The biggest speculators and developers are in Deputy Rabbitte's constituency and they benefit from the work Deputies Higgins and Rabbitte did when in Government.</P>

The reductions in the rates of income tax and the increases in the tax bands are fully in line with the expectations of the social partners.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for our privilege.</P>
      <P>This country suffered economic hardship for a long time before achieving independence. The early years of the State were spent recovering from the <i>laissez faire</i> policies of the previous century which had reduced much of the population to a state of grinding poverty. The financial focus was geared to capture the development of our infrastructure and we have much to be proud of for what was achieved in those early years.</P>
      <P>We had to contend also with an economic war with Britain. The years during the Second World War were spent protecting whatever degree of economic independence we had achieved. This was a period of sustained protectionism. Little economic development could take place in the aftermath of the war. There was economic depression up to the end of the 1960s. Under the Government led by Seán Lemass, we enjoyed a period of successful development during the 1960s. This, in turn, was soured by forces beyond our control with the oil crisis of the 1970s, which led to disastrous inflation and a further downturn in the economy. Taxation during that period was also at an all time high.</P>
      <P>The various programmes for economic expansion and the inclusion of the social partners in securing industrial peace have helped enormously to create an era of economic prosperity which this country has never before enjoyed at any time in our long and colourful history. Is it any wonder then that the Minister has reduced the high rate of income tax by 2p, from 44% to 42%. The new American Government &ndash; Deputy Michael D. Higgins would not be a great admirer, and perhaps I am imputing opinions to him that are not fair &ndash; wants to reduce the income tax rate from 38% to 33%.</P>
      <P>The Government has increased spending on health by over 86% in the last four budgets and we still believe we are not doing enough. Education which has been the cornerstone of our economic development has seen an increase of 66% and we still do not have adequate facilities for our children, or indeed all our adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to a number of specific points in the Bill. I am pleased the Minister has taken <Col N="1065" /> on board the retrospective tax relief and the purchase of a taxi licence. This will help in some way to overcome the sense of grievance felt by some taxi drivers as a result of the decision to increase the number of taxi licences. I am pleased also that the Minister said in his contribution he would be prepared to consider specific hardship cases. Taxi drivers are not the cute bunch people often portray them to be. Some of them made investments that in the cold light of day may be regarded as naive. A small number of these people are enduring real hardship, therefore, I ask the Minister to be as sensitive as he possibly can in dealing with those cases of genuine hardship. Some of these people bought taxi plates at inflated prices for what they saw as a pension investment.</P>
    <P>I fully applaud the savings scheme the Minister announced. This will make a huge difference to the savings culture in this country. I recall when, as a young teacher, we were always promoting Post Office savings schemes in school. The smaller saver will benefit enormously from this measure but I do not think it will be of concern to the speculators.</P>
    <P>The provision of tax relief on charitable donations is very worthwhile. It will benefit charities at home, including the contributions parents and others make to developments in primary, secondary and third level education.</P>
    <P>The relief from stamp duty for first time buyers will be of considerable benefit and will help the housing market. Many first time buyers were not in a position to purchase a previously owned house because of the stamp duty demand.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes from income tax to capital gains tax on the share saver schemes was widely welcomed. I was disappointed to note that the level of take-up of the scheme was so low and that just approximately 1,000 people contribute to the scheme at present. The schemes are an excellent means for employees to get a slice of their company's action and I hope this provision will encourage more companies to introduce them for their employees.</P>
    <P>Tax relief on health insurance premiums is an excellent provision. The restrictions which apply to tax relief on third level fees are removed in the Bill. I welcome the tax relief for repeat years for more than one course to holders of existing third level qualifications. This is increasingly happening, particularly in relation to people who have studied under the open university regime. The exclusion of medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training has been removed.</P>
    <P>The benefit in kind in relation to child care has been improved considerably. I applaud the Minister for what he has done in section 22 which allows an exemption from benefit in kind where employers are involved in financing but not managing facilities. Many small companies provide good child care facilities. This provision is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I support the room for rent provision. This is an enlightened move whereby a person's principal private residence can be let as residential <Col N="1066" /> accommodation. Where the gross annual income is less than £6,000, the annual rental income will be exempt from tax. This will not affect stamp duty clawback, capital gains tax or the full entitlement to mortgage interest relief. It will help to provide additional accommodation. In the case of elderly people who might like to have someone share their house, it will remove the suspicion that they are breaking the law by letting a room and not declaring it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement on the mobility allowance scheme which the Minister made earlier this week. A working party is discussing this matter. There is an anomaly whereby someone who is disabled can benefit from the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concession scheme and travel with an able bodied driver in a three litre vehicle, an off road vehicle generally, but if they own the vehicle that concession does not apply. A small group of people who are interested in outdoor pursuits such as fishing, cross-country riding and so on have been in touch with me. They believe the scheme should be modified to take account of their concerns.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I would welcome a more extended debate with Deputy Higgins.</P>

      <P>The Minister when introducing the budget stated that the measures announced would improve the quality of life of all our people. The question I would ask is when? The central issue in Irish society today is quality of life. The average person is tired of queuing and being caught in the traffic jam.</P>
      <P>Health service budget allocations may well be up 87% over the life of this Administration, but do people believe that the availability of the service has improved? The people do not believe this. There is a lack of forward planning of the delivery of health services within the community. We have witnessed the erosion of the general practitioner's capacity to provide the level of service now required as community medicine while the hospital is over-stretched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look at the education aspect. We are told of the major increase in funding, yet we have seen students demonstrate on the streets demanding that their teachers' grievances are addressed. The opportunity our current affluence affords was not seized to address meaningfully the effects of past educational disadvantage. While the Government continues to underfund educational supports in the formative years of school attendance, positive intervention in delivery of identification of children with learning difficulties at the earliest possible stage should have been targeted. Knowledge is power and the par<Col N="1067" /> ents of today want to ensure their children's capacity to absorb knowledge is not impeded.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of creating a fair society, yet squanders a real opportunity to give young people the chance of a full life which would be fair and would improve the quality of life. However, before the child even gets to school, the Minister could have been of real help to parents and children by addressing the child care issue, with a real commitment to ensure best practice at an affordable price to average income earners.</P>
    <P>The cost of child care is a constraint on family development, a source of worry to parents and a drain on the household budget. It also entails a loss in benefit to society, which includes the young child. The Minister's failure to reduce the burden on those involved is another missed opportunity. It is madness to under resource health and education and folly to fail to address the child care issue.</P>
    <P>We are told the economy is over heating and that there is a scarcity of manpower. The cost of child care is not addressed in a way that would allow low income earners with children to rejoin the workforce because so much of the take home pay is spent before it is earned in securing child minding services. The Minister makes play of the concept of a fair society but he does not provide the basis for the fairness to apply across the board. Economic prosperity is great provided one can afford to partake. The Minister and his colleagues in Government may be able to afford it, but the woman with a couple of children cannot.</P>
    <P>The lost opportunities in the Bill are a long-term disaster for the State. Young couples starting out in life naturally aspire to a home of their own. The State has played a major part in establishing the concept that home ownership is a right for each family. When that could not be immediately achieved local authority housing would be available until life improved when the family would have the option to acquire its own home. This has been eroded.</P>

        <b>:</b> I thank Deputy Cosgrave for sharing his time with me. It is an insult to Members of the Dáil and the people we represent that this massive Bill of 320 pages must be dealt with in such a peremptory fashion rather than allowing for a proper and real debate. The Bill reinforces the economic policies of the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government, which have resulted in an increasing polarisation between the super rich and the very highly paid on the one hand, and the poor and low middle income earners on the other hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is a committed right wing politician who ruthlessly advances the economic interests of the wealthiest minority in this society. He and his Government are part of the international trend of globalisation which in the past decade has been responsible for the greatest ever shift in wealth from the poorest in society to the <Col N="1068" /> wealthiest. At the micro level of this State the Bill reinforces that right wing trend.</P>
    <P>The Minister has maintained a tax liability for workers on the national minimum wage, which is set at £4.40 per hour. By contrast, a single person earning a salary of £80,0000 per annum will this year receive a hand back of £2,564 as a result of the budget. It has been the trend of the Government over the past three and a half years to cause increasing inequality between the poorer and the lower income earners on the one hand and the very highly paid and the wealthiest in society on the other hand.</P>
    <P>Incredibly, given the housing crisis brought about by the actions of the speculators, the Minister has again facilitated them. They could have been attacked in the 1970s and since if the Kenny report had been implemented. Building land could have been taken from their grasp and utilised for the social purposes for which it should be used at cost price to provide cheap homes. In the last year or so the Minister made a major concession to the speculators by reducing the rate of tax on land sold to 20%. He then held up the stick of a tax rate of 60% to be applied next year if they did not get rid of the land before then. However, lo and behold, the stick turns into yet another fairy wand for the speculator friends of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous that the tax on speculators who have been buying new homes is to be reduced. All restraints on the speculators are being reduced even though they are responsible for the crisis in the housing market. The Minister is making great efforts to realise the admonition of the New Testament that to those who have more shall be given. Unfortunately, the opposite is also part of the equation, that for those who have not, even that which they have shall be taken away.</P>
    <P>The first time house buyers on average to middle incomes are now forced into the arms of the landlord class whose speculation forced them out of the market in the first instance. The Minister is further entrenching the trend whereby those who cannot afford houses are placed in the arms of the exploiting landlords. This is shameful day in terms of the implementation of policies. The young civil servants in Dublin, the Dáil secretary to whom the Minister will not even give a pittance to address their pay claim are forgotten. Likewise, students are again thrown on the charity of the landlords by the provision of more tax relief for student accommodation. The Minister should instead be providing purpose built State accommodation at cheap rates.</P>
    <P>I am astounded that so few Fianna Fáil Deputies have mentioned the taxi drivers, the genuine taxi families &ndash; not the big speculators &ndash; who own one taxi and who were caught in the terrible bind of paying a heavy price for a plate. Three years ago a constituent of mine paid £80,000 for one plate. Despite the changes introduced to the granting of licences there is nothing in section 46 to provide for them. Where are their Fianna Fáil champions now? The Minister must <Col N="1069" /> consider hardship cases where there is genuine need and expand the policy to take care of them. I am sorry we must debate the Bill in this undignified rush.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The controversial decision to abolish the employer's ceiling on PRSI contributions is a cause of concern. The PRSI system is very complicated and needs radical overhaul. It features in seven sections in the Bill. The removal of the ceiling will generate an extra £159 million in revenue. The upper ceiling of £36,000 per employee will be abolished. High-tech companies holding on to staff will have to pay £120 for each additional £1,000 of salary. Staff retention is already a problem for a huge number of companies and this will exacerbate matters. As an ameliorating measure I welcome the proposals on a share options saving scheme.</P>
      <P>People earning the minimum wage of £4.40 per hour are still being taxed. The budget is of most benefit to those earning higher incomes. It is regrettable that people earning a mere £176 per week will continue to pay tax. Given that so many people are dependent on it, the minimum wage should not be subject to tax. At present it is only a gross minimum wage, but speaking as an employer that is not good enough for employees who tend only to consider their net wages. I welcome the commitment to address this issue in the next budget.</P>
      <P>The relaxation of the benefit in kind tax arrangement for employers who support child care must be welcomed. However, there is a difficulty with the provision of child care facilities. Responsibility for providing them has been removed from the employer, but who will provide them?</P>
      <P>The Bill represents a lost opportunity to make future financial provision for those who are most in need. There is a need to encourage savings so that people will provide for pensions and other needs. However, people on benefit or in low paid jobs will not have the money to take advantage of the proposed savings scheme. We must remember that the budget is very much geared towards people on substantial salaries. People on low incomes, those to whom Deputy Higgins referred, who have to pay for child care, who must pay mortgages, rear children and educate their families, have not benefited. The wealthier have got wealthier as a result of this budget rather than those who needed it the most, those on low incomes. There were, however, benefits in regard to social welfare. This Government is obsessed with the millions it has to spend. It is important to remember people on low incomes. We should start on the bottom rung of the ladder and not at the top. That is what future Governments will clearly look at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to those who contributed to the debate yesterday and today. I must confess to being somewhat confused as to exactly what Deputy <Col N="1070" /> Mitchell and Fine Gael are concerned about. On the one hand Deputy Mitchell is saying too much has been given in tax reductions generally. On the other hand he and Deputy McGrath seem to be arguing that the 42% top tax rate is too high and that I have not reduced tax by enough.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell in his contribution accused me of always favouring the rich in my income tax changes. Presumably, he is classifying everyone on £15,000 to £20,000 per annum or more as rich since single people on those incomes are, or were, the higher rate taxpayers. It is a very unusual definition of being rich. Moreover, what he says in itself is not accurate. I have cut both high and low tax rates and have widened the standard rate band for middle incomes. I have introduced tax credits, a major socially progressive measure which our predecessors in Government failed to undertake. I have removed record numbers from the tax net.</P>
      <P>However, where I have most difficulty is when the Deputy goes on to propose a tax cutting programme that would favour even more the very class that I am being accused of helping. Abolishing DIRT would favour higher earners with more savings. My tax credit proposal gives the same rate of credit to all, irrespective of income. Reducing the standard rate of VAT to 15% would give a big bonus to buyers of some luxury goods and, on balance, not be income-progressive. Introducing a middle tax rate of 30% is a 12 percentage point cut in the top rate of tax and would be great news for high income earners.</P>
      <P>There is one thing on which we agree and that is providing for the future by allocating moneys to the national pension fund set up by me. As the former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Mitchell will have a keen appreciation of providing wisely for future liabilities and, like me, as someone who has seen the good times and bad times in our economic fortunes, he knows that there will be rainy days. I appreciate the Deputy's foresight in these matters and on his frankness in raising it as an issue. I would also echo what he said on our continuing need for capital investment in infrastructure on all fronts to consolidate the growth in income per head achieved in the last six years or so and the failure by some EU commentators to grasp this point. The Deputy is also right in the limit on how much one can prudently invest each year in catching up without risking unacceptable price effects.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from Deputy McGrath's contribution and from the parliamentary questions he puts down that he takes a serious interest in income tax policy and its influence in shaping economic activity. I compliment him on his devotion to the subject and it enhances the quality of the debate in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy repeated many statistics already on the record of the House from replies that I have given to his questions. I remind the House of a few key statistics that highlight the success of our income tax policies and, indeed, our overall <Col N="1071" /> economic success. When the Government came into office the Revenue Commissioners had 1.49 million income earners on the their books &ndash; on the income tax file, as it is known &ndash; of whom 380,000, or roughly 25%, had been exempted from paying tax. Currently, the Revenue have records of 1.769 million earners on the tax file of whom 668,000 will be taken out of the tax net by the provisions of this Finance Bill. In absolute terms, the number exempted from tax so far in our term of office has been almost doubled. In percentage terms, it has gone from 25% to 38%. The 668,000 are the pensioners, the lower paid and, in many cases, they are people who have only recently joined the ranks of the employed. They deserve to experience the rewards of their labours and are people deserving of support in taxation policies. This Government has given them that support in full measure.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went on to deal with the numbers paying tax at the top rate. I would like to clarify for Deputies that when the Government came to office, of the 1.49 million income earners, some 424,000 were paying tax at the top rate. That was around 28% of all income earners. The measures in this Bill reduce the proportion of income earners who pay at the top rate to 23% or just over 400,000 taxpayers. What of that top rate itself? What the Deputy omitted to highlight is the telling statistic in relation to the rates of tax. The House need not worry about any information gap as I will put it on the record again. Since this Government took office, we have reduced both the top rate and the standard rates by a full six percentage points. That means that the 400,000 who remain paying tax at the top rate pay at a rate which is six percent less than was the case in 1997-98.</P>
    <P>The other development is the point at which the top rate tax becomes applicable. For the single person &ndash; over 55% of those paying tax are of that status &ndash; this Finance Bill puts the threshold for the top rate of tax to £20,000 per annum. The message is simple. Ordinary people on ordinary incomes are being allowed to keep more of their income for their own use.</P>
    <P>In his comments on changes in the way statistics are presented, Deputy McGrath fails to give us credit for the huge increase in the numbers that our policies have removed from the tax net completely. To persist with an approach to overall tax statistics that failed to take account of the 668,000 that have been exempted from tax would present an incomplete picture to this House and the public. The defects in such an approach would have become glaring as time went on and our policies removed still more people from the tax net. There may have been more of a case for a statistical approach that concentrated on those actually paying tax when the proportion exempt was just 25%. Now the exempts have increased to 38% of the income earner base and at that level, they have to be taken into account in the overall analysis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> The Deputy also commented on a reduction in value of allowances as a result of the change to tax credits. I should remind the House that when we changed over to the standard rating of tax allowances, as the prelude to the move to tax credits, we were careful to ensure that allowances were doubled so that persons paying tax at the higher rate did not lose out. In relation to the key allowances, that is, the personal allowance and the PAYE allowance, these are worth more this year compared to last year, notwithstanding the reduction in rates. The PAYE tax credit will be worth £400 to a taxpayer this year compared to £220 last year, while the value of the personal tax credit has gone up from £1,034 to £1,100 for a single person. The reduction in the tax rates affects the value of certain reliefs. However, what Deputy McGrath overlooks is that the balance of the unrelieved income is being taxed at a lower rate due to the reduction in the tax rates and as result taxpayers are better-off overall. I would also be surprised if he was questioning the value of giving reliefs in a way that benefit all taxpayers equally, irrespective of their marginal rate of taxation. There is a symmetry to these matters of which he may not fully have taken account.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mitchell and McDowell suggested that the new savings incentive scheme I announced is a rushed reaction to EU criticism. I recommend that they re-read my budget speech. I set out a precise philosophy of countering inflation through a series of measures, including promotion of savings. The scheme we have come up with reflects careful consideration of this matter both before and after the budget and in response to a series of submissions from various groups, including IBEC and ICTU.</P>
    <P>I would not fully accept Deputy Mitchell's and Deputy McDowell's other criticisms of the scheme. It is not that the costs of the scheme are unquantifiable. I do not fully accept Deputy Mitchell's and Deputy McDowell's other criticisms of the scheme. The costs of the scheme are not unquantifiable. As with any new scheme, a variety of assumptions may be made about take up etc. and this gives a range of costs depending on the various assumptions. As I indicated in response to Dáil questions last week, our best estimate is a cost in the order of £100 million in a full year. This would assume net savings of £400 million per annum in the scheme. I would be happy to see the scheme maximised, resulting in significantly more savings and, therefore, a greater cost. Most changes made to the tax system have effects that last for longer than one year, for example adjusting tax rates or bands or introducing a scheme such as BES or film tax relief. The budgetary commitments in this case are no different than this.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is always a risk of some existing savings benefiting, but the scheme is designed in a way that should also guarantee new savings. Deputy Mitchell's proposal, supported by Deputy Kenny, to abolish DIRT would give more than £100 million per annum as a bonus to existing <Col N="1073" /> savers. What strikes me as more strange is his plan to give one-off tax concessions which would be put into a fund to be clawed back if the Government wished the following year. According to Deputy Mitchell, at least 75% of future income tax concessions would be given by shares in a fund in a year by year decision. Therefore, instead of getting increases in personal tax credits or bands or a reduction in rates, a once-off tax benefit would be given with basic tax credits etc. left unchanged. In the following year, the Government would decide whether to give some tax reduction again. At least when this Government gives a tax reduction, people know they will still have it the following year.</P>
    <P>Deputies McDowell, Kenny and others had a number of questions about how the savings scheme would operate, which can be discussed further at a later stage. I might mention in response to one query from Deputy Kenny that the funds are to be saved over a five year period, not held for five years at the end of the period. I do not believe there is a fundamental difference of principle between Deputies and me on the matter of encouraging savings, rather on the different ways to achieve the desired effect. We can argue those differences further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised various questions about the changes proposed in relation to housing. The Government has always been proactive on housing problems, commissioning studies and taking measures as needed. Housing output continues to grow at a rapid rate. In 2000, we built almost 50,000 units, an increase of 7% on the previous year's total and the sixth consecutive year of record housing output. Our house building rate is by far the highest in Europe. Last year, we built 13 new houses for every 1,000 people in the country, twice the EU average and almost six times the rate in the UK.</P>

      <P>Some 40,000 to 60,000 people left this country on an annual basis in the past but similar numbers are now returning each year. It is much more preferable to have an unemployment rate of 3.9% with people coming home than an 18% unemployment rate and people leaving the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government measures have a positive effect on output and the output prospects for 2001 are <Col N="1074" /> promising. HomeBond registrations, a leading indicator of private new housing starts, last year totalled 34,6000 units, up more than 2% on the 1999 total; 86,500 housing units received planning permission in 2000, an increase of 13% on 1999; and output on local authority housing programmes will increase significantly this year. Further measures now under way, including the proposed designation of strategic development zones for residential development, completion of local authority housing strategies and proactive recruitment of construction professionals from abroad, will help further increase housing output over the coming years.</P>
    <P>House price inflation peaked in 1998. Since then, in spite of continuing high demand and falling interest rates, the Government has succeeded in moderating house price trends. Provisional house price data for 2000 suggests that average new and second-hand house prices in Dublin grew by 10% to 12% in 2000, well down on peaks of 36% for new houses and 41% for second-hand houses in 1998.</P>

      <P>There is firm evidence that first-time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market, especially at the lower end of the market with starter homes. Indicative figures from the Department of the Environment and Local Government's house purchase survey show that the first-time buyers' share of the £100,000 to £150,000 housing market increased by 6% both nationally and in Dublin. For example, it increased from 38% to 44% nationally and from 37% to 43% in Dublin since the introduction of the Government's targeted measures in June.</P>

This welcome trend is also accompanied by a significant fall-off in investor activity in this market price range, with the investors' share of the under £150,000 housing market dropping from 16% at the start of the year to 3% in September according to Irish Permanent figures.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the change in the 60% rate of CGT and zoned residential land disposals. The purpose of the introduction of this provision in April 1998 was to encourage the supply of such land prior to April 2002. This supply has increased considerably in the past two years and there was a big increase in the number of full planning permissions granted in 2000, as compared to 1999. If the 60% rate of CGT were to apply from 6 April 2002, it would mean that the rate of CGT on zoned residential land would be three times that on zoned commercial land which could have resulted in land being diverted from residential to commercial development.</P>

The Government is not seeking to favour land owners or developers. We are simply trying to encourage those who can do so to increase the supply of residential properties to meet demand and housing needs. As was stated in the discussion, there are two sides to the coin &ndash; investors need tenants and tenants need investors. Is there not a public benefit all round where both sides gain?</P>

      <P>Deputy Timmins suggested abolishing stamp duty on all houses. Stamp duty is a significant source of tax revenue, bringing in approximately £1 billion this year, of which a very large part relates to real property. Deputy McDowell asked whether VAT reductions were passed on to the consumer. In my budget speech on 6 December 2000, I indicated that the Government expected the VAT reductions to be passed on to the final consumer, not absorbed in higher retail margins and that if this did not occur, the wisdom of future VAT cuts would be placed in doubt. Initial analysis from the CSO suggests that there has been some pass-on to the consumer with price reductions in a number of sectors due to VAT changes. My Department will continue to examine this closely in consultation with the CSO.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crawford asked about the level of flat rate VAT returned to farmers. The purpose of the flat rate refund is to compensate unregistered farmers in full for the VAT they pay on the goods and services they use in carrying on their business. The Government is satisfied that the increase of 0.1% achieves this objective for 2001.</P>
      <P>Deputies Reynolds and Crawford welcomed the alignment of the calendar and tax years and the application of tax and weekly social welfare changes from the beginning of the year. This is a very important feature of this year's Finance Bill. The Government has decided that budget 2002 will be presented to Dáil Éireann on Wednesday, 5 December 2001.</P>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important issue. The controversy which has emerged in the past week has seriously exposed the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil led Government on the issue of western development. The Taoiseach shot himself in the foot by offering responsibility for the Western Development Commission to the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, and discovering that he did not want it. The Minister of State said: &ldquo;I am a doer, not a talker &ndash; nobody likes a powerless politician and as far as I can see, this is what I will be in this new role&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy a doer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In an even more startling interview in <i>The Irish Times,</i> the Minister of State said, &ldquo;I suppose I should be delighted at the new post, because I can put my feet up.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;What is rural development?&rdquo; and said he would not like people to think he was going to be able to save the west. I am glad the Minister of State is present to clarify those statements. His approach reminds me of the saying, &ldquo;Nero fiddled while Rome burned&rdquo;, in that the Minister of State could put up his feet while there is such work to be done in the west, which is currently in a state of decline.</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach lost the run of himself in offering this brief to the Minister of State? This episode is a tangible demonstration to the people of the west that they are an afterthought or a hindrance to the Taoiseach and his Fianna Fáil colleagues. The Taoiseach finds himself in interesting company. The last person to have this attitude to the west was Oliver Cromwell and I do not propose to repeat what he said about Connacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure not only the people of Galway West but every member of the Fianna Fáil Party west of the Shannon must be amazed at the attitude <Col N="1080" /> taken by the Minister of State. The attitude of the Taoiseach and the Minister of State is deplorable and one they will come to regret, not only because I intend, on behalf of the people of the west, to use every opportunity to remind them of the importance of the region and its urgent needs but also because the people of the west will make Fianna Fáil pay for it at election time. Fine Gael more than any other party in Ireland, and certainly more than Fianna Fáil, is aware of the needs of the west, the challenges faces by the people of the region and the urgent need for action to combat the many problems facing the region.</P>
    <P>It was Fine Gael, under the then Minister of State, Deputy Carey, who established the Western Development Commission. The commission is responsible for promoting economic and social development in the seven western counties of Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Mayo, Galway and Clare. It works in co-operation with national, regional and local bodies to secure the development of the western region. Contrary to what the Minister of State said, there is neither funding nor function in his proposed new role. The commission also manages the western development fund.</P>
    <P>Let me inform the Taoiseach and the Minister of State of some of the issues relevant to the west today which underpin the need for urgent action. The economic gap is widening. While the western region accounts for 37% of the country's landmass and 18% of the national population, it accounted for a mere 9.6% of the national net industrial output in 1996. Latest research shows that this share is continuing to fall. That is because there is Government inaction.</P>
    <P>There is an imbalance in tourism performance. Rural areas in the western region have largely lost out on tourism growth. Most of the tourism revenue in the western region is drawn from the small number of coastal towns. For instance, accommodation clusters hug the coast with no major hotel with more than 250 beds located away from the coast.</P>
    <P>There has been a failure to attract inward investment to the region. The western region outside of Galway attracted only 5% of new IDA jobs announced in 2000. IDA figures for the north west region last year showed a net jobs loss and the number employed in IDA backed companies in Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal fell by 1,240 since 1996.</P>
    <P>The western region accounts for a high proportion of industries that are vulnerable to closure and have low productivity. Examples are food, textiles and timber. For instance, industrial productivity per person in the region is only 60% of the national average. The region has no major indigenous source of power and the national grid into the region is 30 years out of date and inadequate.</P>
    <P>In the key areas of tourism, access, infrastructure, inward investment and energy, the Government has failed in its obligation and responsibility <Col N="1081" /> to the people of the west. In relation to the Taoiseach's handling of the issue and the Minister of State's irresponsibility in saying what he said about his new role, they should apologise to the people of the west. They should make the necessary investment to ensure the work required is carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Éamon Ó Cuív)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Deputy tabled this motion to explain the reason the seven western counties that constitute the western development region lag behind every other region in terms of economic development. I am delighted to speak on it, even though the Deputy did not address it. If he did, one would have to go back a long time in history, geography and topography to find the reasons this problem arose in the first place.</P>
      <P>I am in the west by choice. I went there to create development. The people of the west, particularly the people of the Gaeltacht, will judge me on the record of what I have done. I have been involved in the creation of industry and wealth. I have the great privilege to live in one of the most rural areas of the country with the highest rate of industrial jobs per head of population that would match any city in Ireland. I have toiled in the field day and night to create employment. Members sitting behind the Minister of State would be able to vouch for that. It is interesting that a political colleague of the Deputy's spoke on Raidió na Gaeltachta yesterday in support of what I said. He is someone who had similarly worked in the field and knows what real development in the west is about. It is not the tokenism we seem to get so often.</P>
      <P>The development of the west and of any area losing its population &ndash; and some of those areas are not only in the west, they are in the south east, the south, the midlands and even in the east &ndash; as in the case of solving urban problems, is the responsibility of the Government. Until all of us in this House understand that, we will not solve that problem.</P>

      <P>Since the foundation of the State and even prior to that, several efforts were made to redress this problem, including the establishment of the Congested Districts Boards, the foundation of Roinn na Gaeltachta and the foundation of Gaeltarra Éireann. Significant growth has been recorded in certain areas of the west in recent years, particularly in areas adjacent to major population centres, such as Galway city &ndash; which is thriving and booming and Deputy McCormack will explain that to the Deputy &ndash; Castlebar, Sligo and Letterkenny. Much more remains to be done.</P>

      <P>Among the measures to be adopted to accelerate development in this region are its inclusion in the BMW region under the national plan, the establishment of the Western Development Board on a statutory basis, the expansion of the funding and work of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. For some peculiar reason, some people do not consider the Gaeltacht and the islands appear to be part of the west. The islands in particular are the most peripheral communities in the west. There has been major increase in activities on the islands and I will let the islanders be my judge on that one.</P>

      <P>The fact is steps are being taken. This issue is a matter for everybody in Government and a responsibility for every Department. It would be foolish if I were to let the people believe that a type of operation that was possible in the Gaeltacht for historical reasons will be possible under my new ministry. The issue should be debated openly. Beidh áthas <Col N="1083" /> orm lá ar bith é a phlé go hiomlán leis an Teachta in aon áit a shocraíonn sé. I am sure that when that debate is finished, the people of the west will thank us for being honest and open and not simply defending the position. One of the reasons the Taoiseach gave me this job is that he knows I have controversial and outspoken views on this subject. I also have a track record which proves that I am willing to put effort into the issue of western development.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Physiotherapy Services.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the Western Health Board opened a successful physiotherapy service in the Louisburgh area. The service caters for Westport, Inishturk and Clare Island, and the people of the area are delighted with it. The service was funded under the general practitioners' drugs subsidy scheme by doctors saving money on drugs. Poor people were effectively subsidising the service, but the doctors and patients managed to gather the necessary money for it.</P>
      <P>Many elderly people use the service and are happy with it. However, the Western Health Board has decided to locate the service in Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar. The people want the service, with which they are delighted, retained in the area. If it is moved, a person from Inishturk or Clare Island will have to travel by boat to the mainland and get a bus from Louisburgh to Castlebar. They will have to make the return journey in the evening. At present, they can travel to the mainland by boat in the morning and return home early.</P>
      <P>Governments and health boards have been talking for the past 30 years about bringing services to the people. This service was brought to the people who responded to it and are delighted with it. Why fix something that is not broken? The service works and the people are happy with it. As the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, is aware, a physiotherapy service has not been available in his town of Ballina, Belmullet and other parts of the county. I am aware of the case of a young person who left hospital last week and who needs physiotherapy. However, the person received a letter from the health board yesterday stating that it would be six months before a physiotherapist would be available to treat them in Belmullet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ballina has been without a physiotherapist in recent months. The people of Louisburgh and surrounding areas are delighted with the service there because it bring business to the town. People from other parts of the county are travelling to Louisburgh which is a small rural town. I plead with the Minister to speak to the health board and make the correct decision to leave that good service in place. Why is it necessary for people aged over 65 years to travel to Castlebar for treatment? More than 300 elderly people live in the area and they must travel by bus from Louisburgh to Castlebar. These people are in <Col N="1084" /> pain and in need of physiotherapy. I urge the Minister to leave the service in place. He should not fix what is not broken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for the opportunity to clarify the situation in relation to the provision of physiotherapy services and the pilot physiotherapy scheme operated by the Western Health Board.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no proposals from the Deputy's party or any other party to reverse that decision. Health boards have responsibility for the provision of general practitioner services for people with full eligibility for general medical services. This responsibility extends to the provision of physiotherapy services for those individuals for whom such a service has been prescribed by their doctor. To facilitate GPs and patients in the Mayo area, a physiotherapy service was set up in Mayo General Hospital under which GPs could have direct access to physiotherapy for their patients.</P>
      <P>In early 2000, it became apparent that Mayo General Hospital was having problems recruiting physiotherapists and that the waiting list for physiotherapy was steadily increasing. To address the waiting list, the Western Health Board provided £35,000 from GPs' drug savings and contracted three private physiotherapists in Mayo to provide a physiotherapy service in Castlebar, Westport and Louisburgh. This arrangement was not considered a pilot scheme but a short-term solution to the growing waiting list pending the resumption of the physiotherapy service in Mayo General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Western Health Board that the full physiotherapy service based in Mayo General Hospital will resume at the end <Col N="1085" /> of April 2001. The full service will enable all County Mayo GPs to have equal access for their patients to physiotherapy services.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of allied health professional staff generally is presenting problems for all health boards. It is clear that the demand for the three therapy grades &ndash; occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy &ndash; needs to be reviewed. To address this issue, my Department has engaged Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates to undertake a workforce planning study to report on the prospective supply and demand for a number of therapy grades, including physiotherapy. This report is expected in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>I spoke to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, about this matter and he indicated that, through funding made available by the Department, a convent in Louisburgh was bought recently.</P>

I will convey the Deputy's views to the health board, and the Minister of State has said that he will take a personal interest in this matter. The purchase of the convent provides opportunities for the provision of locally based services in a good environment. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I call on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to release £14 million to enable central heating to be installed in corporation houses. This issue is particularly relevant at this time of year, given the weather conditions we have experienced over the past few days. Elderly people are suffering particularly badly from the cold. Many of the people in corporation flats have paid rent all their lives, but most of the flats do not have central heating.</P>
      <P>Elderly people in areas in my constituency, such as Cherry Orchard, have been corporation tenants for many years and have paid their rent. However, their flats do not have the benefit of central heating. This is particularly worrying because they do not receive a substantial fuel allowance. One of the complaints I hear on a regular basis from many of my constituents is that the fuel allowance is ineffective. It means they must pay an inordinate amount of money trying to keep their houses warm by other means. On that basis alone, consideration should be given to providing them with some comfort by installing central heating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The RAPID plan was paraded recently by the Government. The purpose of this scheme is to <Col N="1086" /> prioritise the national development plan's spending on local authorities. However, no money is currently available under the plan for the installation of central heating to give corporation tenants a decent quality of life. Contractors were ready to install central heating in many houses if money had been made available to them. Huge sums of money are being set aside for projects such as Stadium Ireland, which will not benefit the corporation tenants about whom I am concerned. It is a shame the Government's priorities are not different and that a relatively modest amount of money, £14 million, is not available for this work. I call on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make this money available so that elderly tenants in particular, many of whom live in poverty, can be given some degree of comfort in their old age through the provision of central heating in their corporation houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue on the Adjournment. Local authorities were informed in 1994 that all new local authority houses should be provided with full central heating. The capital cost of these houses is met in full by the Department. The management, maintenance and improvement of rented dwellings, including the installation of central heating, are the responsibility of the local authority. For this purpose, the local authority may use the full proceeds of its rental income and miscellaneous housing receipts, supplemented, as necessary, from its general revenue resources. The most recent statistics available from local authorities indicate that, in 1999, £135 million was spent on the management and maintenance of their rented housing stock.</P>
      <P>While responsibility for management and maintenance rests with the local authority, the Department provides 100% capital funding for authorities under the remedial works scheme to assist the local authority to carry out major works to designated housing estates, mainly pre-1960 and run-down urban estates. The installation of central heating may form part of the works undertaken in such cases.</P>
      <P>In addition to the funding available under the remedial works scheme, local authorities may seek the Department's approval for the use of their internal capital receipts which are surplus to the requirements of the local authorities' housing programme and remedial works scheme for improvement works such as the provision of central heating to their dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing, the Department has no capital provision from which to fund the installation of central heating in local authority housing generally. Dublin Corporation wrote to the Department in June last seeking funding, under the area regeneration programme, of £16 million for the provision and upgrading of central heating in its rented houses which lack the facility. The area regeneration programme is a special allo<Col N="1087" /> cation which provides funding mainly for the upgrading of high density older flat complexes at various locations in Dublin city and it would not be possible to fund the provision of central heating in the corporation's tenancy houses under it. This was explained and the general position on the funding of central heating outlined by the Department in a reply to the corporation in September 2000. A further proposal received recently from the corporation is being examined. The corporation will be advised of the Department's response as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On a general level, the Department is keeping the issue of central heating in local authority dwellings under review. Definitive information is not available on the overall number of local authority dwellings which do not have central heating facilities. In view of this a questionnaire, which issued to local authorities in early January seeking information on a range of housing issues, sought specific information on the number of local authority rented dwellings which have full, partial or no central heating. The receipt of detailed information is awaited and, when received, should help to further inform policy in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister for coming into the House to respond. It is not the first time I have raised it with him. I raised the matter during the course of the debate on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000, and also at Question Time when dealing with the issue of street violence.</P>
      <P>While the overall level of alcohol consumed presents a serious problem, the level of alcohol consumed by young people presents a particular problem. In its recent report the World Health Organisation found that Ireland's teenagers are top of the European league when it comes to under age drinking. They drink more, get drunk more often and regularly indulge in binge sessions. Over one half regularly engage in drinking sessions. Lest anybody is in any doubt, the problem is as serious, if not more so, for girls.</P>
      <P>We, in Ireland, have a reputation for drinking. While some sometimes speak as if they are proud of this, recent media reports, both on television and in the newspapers, have shown the uglier side of drink, particularly what it can do to young people. I can confidently state that most young people are of the view that it is the norm to start drinking at the age of 15 or 16 years. Many are also of the view, unfortunately, that it is okay to experiment with so-called recreational drugs. Almost 35% of teenagers have experimented with cannabis and ecstasy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Street violence has been a topic for discussion on numerous occasions in the past 12 months. In fairness to the Government, there has been a reasonably good response in making our streets safer through the introduction of Operation <Col N="1088" /> Oíche in Dublin and Cork and, although delayed, CCTV cameras. Those who must deal regularly with street disturbances and their consequences will tell us categorically that the single biggest cause is alcohol abuse. Doctors in accident and emergency departments, gardaí and night club owners will all give the same answer.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to under age drinking in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000, was only half-baked. While the Minister rightly introduced more severe penalties for publicans and the owners of off-licences who serve alcohol to under age persons, he did not provide for any means by which they can assess accurately a person's age. It is impossible to tell the difference between a girl aged 16 years and a girl aged 19 years when dressed to go out for a night. My brother who is 16 years of age, as tall as I am and regularly borrows my razor looks more like a 20 year old. It is impossible for a publican, the owner of an off-licence or a garda to assess accurately a person's age.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000, the Minister introduced a voluntary age card scheme. While I am open to correction, I understand that to date the scheme has been taken up by approximately 20,000 young people, which is lower than the number attending UCD. The scheme has not affected in the slightest the ability of young people between the ages of 14 and 17 years to obtain alcohol in public houses or off-licences as there is no obligation on publicans or the owners of off-licences to demand identification. They have, therefore, nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a mandatory ID card scheme is the only way to ensure young people will be required to show identification, which cannot be forged, before being served alcohol in a public house. State ID systems are operated successfully in other countries. Canada and the United States are prime examples. Why is the Minister reluctant to consider this option? What are the negative aspects holding him back?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children recently launched an awareness campaign on the abuse of alcohol, aimed particularly at young people. He is sending the right message. He is also doing a good job when it comes to smoking. When asked in Sweden ten days ago he said that he would consider speaking to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the introduction of a mandatory ID card scheme. Has he done so? Is the Minister now thinking seriously about the need to introduce such a scheme?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, which I initiated and which came into effect on 6 July last, provides for a considerable strengthening of the law on under age drinking. It takes into account many of the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee which reported on the area, including those recommendations which related to under age drinking. <Col N="1089" /> I also took into account the many submissions received from groups and members of the public following a consultation process.</P>
      <P>With a view to strengthening existing provisions regarding the supply or sale of intoxicating liquor to under age persons, I abolished the defence of reasonable belief in proceedings against a licensee, increased the fines for breaches of the law on under age drinking and provided for a new penalty &ndash; a temporary closure order &ndash; for conviction of the sale of alcohol to under age persons. The removal of the reasonable grounds defence is complementary to the voluntary age card scheme in that it makes reliance on it by licensees more important &ndash; no defence is permitted where a person wilfully supplies liquor to an under age person. These provisions are tough, and I make no apology for them. They must be tough if they are to contribute in an effective way to our efforts to stamp out under age drinking.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coveney, to whom I am grateful for raising this matter, alluded to the fact that there is no obligation on a licensee to look for the identity card. That is not correct. If the licensee has a doubt, he can request the identity card because, if he does not do so and the young person is found on the premises, there is no defence. If in doubt, one should request the card because the offence is now one of strict liability.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Commissioner that the Garda Síochána is resolutely enforcing the licensing laws on under-age drinking. There has been misleading comment to the effect that there has been only one conviction under the 2000 Act since it came into operation last July. This is not the case. Since July six licensed premises have had temporary closure orders made against them as a result of convictions under the Act and the Garda is pursuing cases in respect of another 80 premises nationwide. Three premises have been closed for seven days, two for five and one for three.</P>
      <P>While it takes time for any piece of criminal law to begin to take effect, it is clear from the figures to date that the law is working and is beginning to have the desired effect. The Garda Síochána acknowledges that, as far as a legislative measure can contribute to a solution to the problem of under-age drinking, the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2000, provides the Garda with the necessary powers. These additional provisions, in conjunction with the national age card scheme which I introduced in April 1999, will further strengthen the hand of all agencies in the fight against under-age drinking,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The age card scheme allows any person who has attained 18 years of age to apply for an age card at his or her local Garda station to confirm that they have attained the legal age for the purchase of intoxicating liquor. The Garda community relations section in Harcourt Square, Dublin 2, has overall responsibility for the issuing of the cards. The cards have security features which include a hologram incorporated into their <Col N="1090" /> design. Approximately 23,300 age cards have been issued to date.</P>
    <P>With a view to promoting the scheme, I launched the age card scheme awareness campaign in Dublin Castle on 6 September 2000 in conjunction with the Garda authorities who have taken the following steps to promote the use of the age card. All Garda stations have been notified of the age card scheme and issued with application forms and posters. Non-Garda outlets have also been issued with application forms and posters. A poster campaign has been initiated to target all pubs, stand-alone off-licences and grocery based off-licences, night clubs, dance halls and so on. Youth information centres and youth groups nationwide have been issued with information, posters and contact numbers for further support. Garda juvenile liaison officers and community gardaí are visiting post-primary schools, youth clubs, special projects and so on to highlight the age card scheme. There is ongoing liaison between the drinks industry and the Garda Síochána and new avenues of ensuring young people get the age card message are being explored.</P>
    <P>The question of a mandatory age card scheme was discussed in debates on the Bill that led to the Act of 2000. However, there were doubts about the feasibility of such a scheme. It would be necessary to issue cards to all young people within a certain age range, including those who had no wish or intention to purchase intoxicating liquor. This gives rise to a number of questions. Not least of these is why a 19 or 20 year old who has no desire to drink alcohol should be forced to have an identity card just because some of his friends drink. The question also arises as to the age at which a mandatory card would no longer be required. Would a 65 year old be obliged to have a card and, if so, why? These were questions to which, in the context of the framing of the legislation, there were no easy answers.</P>
    <P>The existing voluntary scheme provides a practical method for consumers and those who sell alcoholic liquor to establish proof of age where a doubt exists. It must be remembered that these are people legally entitled to consume alcohol in a licensed premises. A young person under 18 would have no use for such a card because he or she is not supposed to be drinking on a licensed premises. The card would only be of benefit to a person about whose age there was a doubt and who was over 18.</P>
    <P>The process of reforming our intoxicating liquor laws has not ended and the House will be aware that on 1 November last I established a commission on liquor licensing under the chairmanship of Mr. Gordon Holmes. The membership of the commission represents a wide range of interests and the terms of reference include all aspects of the operation of the licensing laws, including an examination of the problems associated with under-age drinking. I will consider any recommendations the commission makes in relation to under-age drinking and age cards, mandatory or otherwise. The commission will <Col N="1091" /> produce a final report on all other matters within two years, but it is open to it to report earlier on any aspects.</P>
    <P>While legislative measures, together with initiatives such as an age card scheme, can help to curtail the problem of under-age drinking, they cannot be viewed as the only solution. Dealing with the demand side of the under-age drinking problem should not be seen as the province of the State agencies alone. The drinks industry, the creative media, politicians, teachers and parents especially must play their part in helping to address that side of the problem.</P>
    <P>The real challenge is changing attitudes to drink. We know this is extremely difficult to accomplish, but not impossible. It is important that the message goes out to all adults that they <Col N="1092" /> also have an obligation to assist the Garda and I urge adults to report incidents of under-age drinking, whether in licensed premises or not. Parents must also exercise responsibility. Although it is not always easy to keep an eye on what our children do, as any parent knows, nevertheless it is the case that the primary onus for knowing where our children are, whom they are with and what they are doing falls on us all as parents.</P>
    <P>If it should transpire in the course of the commission's deliberations that a mandatory card scheme would assist &ndash; and I have my reservations in that respect for the reasons I outlined &ndash; it will be studied as will Deputy Coveney's statement.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 March 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>The concerns expressed by the pharmacist arose from the outcome of a survey on the reporting of medication errors which was conducted among medical, nursing and pharmacy staff in a Dublin Hospital in June and July 2000.</P>
      <P>In addition to identifying staff attitudes generally to the reporting of medication errors, where such errors occur, the survey sought to establish the perception of the professionals involved of the implications for them of reporting the errors. The outcome showed that fear of disciplinary action was a significant barrier to reporting incidents of medication errors.</P>
      <P>The survey forms part of an overall project at the hospital aimed at improving reporting of errors and moving to a system based approach which seeks to learn from any mistakes and implement changes to policies and procedures with a view to further improving patient comfort and safety. In this regard, my Department provided a grant of £40,000 to the hospital, which will be used for a major project this year to improve error reporting and the hospital's medication use system. This will involve the employment of a best practice facilitator whose job will be to manage a new reporting system within the framework of a new, system-based, non-punitive policy on error reporting. The policy is at an advanced stage of drafting and follows best practice from United States hospitals which have been studied.</P>

      <P>Nurse staffing difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area. Indications are that the situation is improving in this area following recent recruitment initiatives and as recruitment of nurses from abroad begins to pay dividends.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Employers Agency is undertaking a survey of nursing vacancies at 31 January 2001 which should confirm these indications. A copy of this survey will be forwarded directly to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the information available to me indicates that the overall situation in the major Dublin hospitals has improved since September 2000. The number of vacancies in Beaumont Hospital, for example, has fallen from 113.5 at 30 September 2000 to ten currently.</P>
      <P>The position regarding foreign recruitment is that over 700 nurses have been granted work visas or work authorisations since June 2000. The recruitment of these nurses is helping to alleviate in particular the most acute areas of shortages.</P>
      <P>A major new recruitment and retention initiative, costing in excess of £5 million, was launched by me on 29 November 2000 to address the present shortage of nurses and midwives. In particular a new scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service came into operation on 1 February. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent part-time basis.</P>
      <P>As part of my overall recruitment-retention strategy, I have introduced the following financial support for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses: payment of fees to nurses-midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student public health nurses; enhanced financial support package for student midwives and student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses-midwives undertaking specific courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; abolition of fees for &ldquo;back-to-practice&rdquo; courses and payment of salary to nurses-midwives undertaking such courses.</P>
      <P>An advertising campaign aimed at attracting nurses back into the workforce and at attracting nurses back to Ireland ran from 30 November to 31 December 2000. This generated a significant number of inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increasing the number of training places is a central plank of my strategy for addressing the nursing shortage. The number of nursing training places has been increased by 300 to 1,500 until at least 2002. A further 20 places have been filled on a new direct entry midwifery programme <Col N="1095" /> which has been introduced on a pilot basis. Over 1,500 nursing students started training in October 2000 with record intakes to both psychiatric and mental handicap nursing. In order to increase the number of general nursing training places in Dublin, funding has been provided to St. Michael's Hospital, Dun Laoghaire, to commence the pre-registration nursing diploma programme this autumn with an annual intake of 40 students.</P>
    <P>My Department is also engaged in strategic planning through the study of the nursing and midwifery resource. The focus of this work is on longer term planning. The primary objective of the study is to forecast, as far as is possible, future nursing and midwifery workforce needs. An interim report was published in October 2000 and widely circulated within the health services. My £5 million recruitment-retention initiative of 29 November last was an immediate response to a number of the report's recommendations.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the establishment of a working group to look specifically at the situation in the Dublin area are almost finalised. This group will examine factors affecting the recruitment and retention of nursing and midwifery staff in the Dublin area and recommend innovative ways in which the situation might be improved.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to monitor the situation closely in conjunction with the Health Service Employers Agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department or Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 60 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the findings of the recent publication of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland's &ldquo;Update on Ongoing Audit of Compliance with the SRM (Specified Risk Material) Regulations at Irish Meat Premises (January 2001)&rdquo;. As part of this audit of 278 premises, which included domestic and export approved abattoirs as well as butcher outlets, the FSAI found 29 premises, approximately 10 per cent, to be non-compliant. Some 27 were domestic abattoirs under supervision of local authorities and two were export abattoirs under supervision of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Both inspectorates now operate under service contracts with the FSAI.</P>
      <P>In general because of the high throughput of carcases there is a permanent veterinary presence at export approved abattoirs. In the local authority abattoirs, throughput is generally smaller and there is not a permanent presence in these premises; inspection comprises ante and post-mortem examination by a veterinary inspector.</P>
      <P>The FSAI noted that 96 per cent of the animals slaughtered at the domestic abattoirs were under 36 months of age. Legislative controls on feeding meat and bone meal to cattle in Ireland were stringent by 1996-early 1997, therefore these animals would not have had access to contaminated meat and bone meal. However, the removal of SRM from all animals over 12 months is an EU requirement and 100 per cent compliance is required in all abattoirs.</P>
      <P>The FSAI is the statutory agency responsible for the enforcement of all food safety legislation. It executes its functions by means of service contracts with the various official agencies which traditionally had primary responsibility, such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, health boards and local authorities, in the case of meat inspection.</P>
      <P>One of the FSAI's functions is the audit of inspection arrangements and the recent audit of abattoirs was carried out as part of its wider food safety brief. This audit is ongoing to ensure compliance with SRM legislation and the FSAI intends to issue updates on a quarterly basis. It is precisely this type of exercise that the FSAI will be using to ensure that Ireland's food safety controls are adequate. My Department has provided an additional sum of £100,000 to the Authority in 2001 for the enhancement of its audit function. This was a recommendation of the recent report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of the findings arising from this audit, the FSAI is involved in a variety of actions aimed at protecting consumer health. These actions include the following: when non-compliant abattoirs were found during the conduct of the audit these were dealt with immediately by means of a closure order or an improvement notice, depending on the circumstances. In the FSAI Act, under an improvement notice, a proprietor must identify the activity giving rise to the risk <Col N="1097" /> and is required to take remedial action within a specified time limit. All abattoirs found to be non-compliant during the audit are now compliant or alternatively remain closed. The findings of the audit have been brought to the attention of all abattoir owners by means of a series of mailings and a general meeting held with abattoir owners. The findings have also been widely publicised in the media. FSAI has held a number of training meetings with local authority veterinary inspectors, charged with the inspection of these abattoirs. A specific advice sheet has been sent to all abattoirs, both domestic and export, outlining precisely the requirements for dealing with SRM. The retail and wholesale meat trade has also been contacted in this regard. The FSAI is involved with University College Cork in facilitating a specific training programme for local authority abattoir operatives. The Authority is presently involved with the Veterinary Inspectors of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the local authorities veterinary service as well as the meat trade, in developing a quality manual for the operation of red meat abattoirs. This manual will deal with SRM issues and broader hygiene issues. As a consumer protection measure and in light of the degree of non-compliance in domestic abattoirs, since 1 January 2001 local authority abattoirs are confined to the slaughter of animals under 30 months of age.</P>
    <P>My colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, will meet this week with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, to discuss inspection arrangements in local authority abattoirs.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health and Children</askee>
      <Quest>if he will ensure there is a more proactive approach by his Department and health boards to seek out elderly and vulnerable people, especially following the tragic deaths of four related women in Leixlip.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The tragic deaths of the four women in Leixlip, County Kildare in June 2000 was one of the saddest events which our society has experienced in recent times. May I at the outset tender my deepest sympathy to the womens' relatives and to the people of Leixlip who have been affected by this sad event.</P>
      <P>In 1988 the report entitled &ldquo;The Years Ahead &ndash; A Policy for the Elderly&rdquo; was published and among its recommendations it stated that health boards maintain registers of elderly people at medical or social risk in their areas. The health boards have informed my Department that public health nurses maintain lists of vulnerable older people in their areas; in addition some boards have developed strategies to identify older people at risk.</P>
      <P>The public health nurse plays a vital role in a multi-disciplinary team based approach to the delivery of health services to vulnerable groups in the community, including the elderly and ill and dependent people. This role extends to assessment of need, provision of support and a range of nursing services in the home, co-ordination of services and collaboration with other health professionals, hospitals and voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vulnerable older people are brought to the attention of the public health nursing service through case finding/anticipatory care carried out by the public health nurse, through family members, concerned neighbours, through GPs, and in networking with voluntary agencies etc. Regular contact is maintained with these older <Col N="1099" /> people once identified, and arrangements are made by the public health nurse for any service that the person may need in accordance with a care plan in so far as the public health nurse is permitted to do so by the client involved. Health boards have acknowledged that care plans for vulnerable older people must take account of the wishes of the individual and their families or carers. It has to be recognised that whereas every effort may be made on the part of the health and community-voluntary services, each individual is entitled to his/her privacy and independence and a sensitive balance needs to be struck between the views of the client and carers in this context.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of record that the financial investment which this Government has made in the area of services for older people, has increased very significantly. This investment has been targeted at both community based and residential services with the intention of ensuring a balance in development in line with long-standing policy.</P>
    <P>In the report of the Commission on Nursing it was noted that the delivery of health services in the community is a complex and difficult task and that the significant social and other changes which have taken place impact upon the service and necessitate a more coherent and integrated structure for the delivery of nursing services in the community. Thus, the commission recommended that the Department of Health and Children prepare a revised statement on the role of public health nursing. The Department is about to undertake a review of community nursing services and this review should be completed in early 2002.</P>

      <P>Following recommendations in the Moran Report (Review of Orthodontic Services) structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. An additional investment of £5.3 million has been approved for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority received an additional investment of £2.34 million in 2001 for orthodontic services of which £1.610 million related to the orthodontic initiative. The authority is recruiting additional staff and developing a five surgery unit at St. James's Hospital and a six surgery facility at Loughlinstown Hospital. Three additional consultant orthodontists are being recruited, the appointments to two of these posts are in train and the recruitment process for the third post is under way.</P>
      <P>The Department has also approved a proposal from the ERHA for a grant in-aid scheme. Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment will be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents can also avail of income tax relief on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders.</P>
      <P>The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months. A working group on the implementation of the scheme within the board is being established. The target date for the implementation of the pilot scheme is 1 April this year. The ERHA has advised that this additional investment will facilitate the commencement of treatment for an additional 3,000 patients on the assessment waiting list, validation of waiting lists and the reduction of waiting time to one year.</P>

      <P>The operation of private health insurance business in this country is subject to the provisions of the Health Insurance Act, 1994 and the 1996 health insurance regulations which require all health insurers to operate on a community rating and open enrolment basis.

      <QRef>[5967/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin): I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 79 together.</P>
    <P>Stimulant drinks contain three active ingredients, caffeine, glucuronolactone and taurine. In 1999 the European Scientific Committee for Food was asked by the European Commission for an opinion on caffeine, taurine and glucuronolactone as constituents of so called energy drinks. This committee, which carries out risk assessment on foodstuffs in Europe, reached a number of conclusions in its opinion. These were based on an assumed maximum intake level of 0.5 litre of energy drink per day. It concluded that the contribution of energy drinks to overall caffeine intake is not a matter of concern for non-pregnant adults &ndash; moderation of caffeine intake, from whatever source, is advisable during pregnancy; substitution of energy drinks for normal <Col N="1102" /> beverages by children could lead to increased caffeine levels in this group &ndash; this could result in transient behavioural changes such as arousal, irritability, nervousness or anxiety; the interaction of the constituents of energy drinks has not been well studied, nor has the interaction of caffeine and taurine with alcohol particularly under conditions of exercise and consequent dehydration through sweating; and the safety-in-use of taurine and glucuronolactone as delivered in energy drinks has not been established &ndash; further studies would be required.</P>
    <P>This opinion makes it clear that the scientific data were not available to answer all questions about the safety of these energy drinks under all circumstances of usage.</P>
    <P>Due to the fact that energy drinks are on sale throughout the country, it is important that their safety is evaluated on a national level. I have therefore requested the Food Safety Promotion Board, one of the six North-South Implementation Bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement, to commission independent, scientific research into the effects of these stimulant energy drinks.</P>
    <P>The FSPB has commissioned a review of the current research and levels of knowledge pertaining to the health effects of stimulant drinks; commissioned a survey to determine the consumption patterns of stimulant drinks within population groups &ndash; this survey is due to commence in March 2001; commissioned a review of the marketing and advertising strategies used in the sale of stimulant drinks &ndash; this review is due to be carried out during March and April 2001; and established an expert committee called the Stimulant Drinks Committee to review the matter.</P>
    <P>The SDC anticipates that a detailed report will be published by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which is responsible for the enforcement of food safety law in Ireland, is not aware of any proven links between the consumption of energy drinks and adverse health conditions.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving the scientific research on these energy drinks from the FSPB in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Cardiovascular Health Strategy Group &ndash; Building Healthier Hearts was launched in July 1999. It showed that our premature death rates from coronary heart disease for men and women are twice the EU average. The Department of Health and Children has set a medium term objective to bring our levels of premature deaths from cardiovascular disease in <Col N="1103" /> line with the EU average at a minimum and a long-term objective of reducing our rates to those of the best performers in the EU. Building Healthier Hearts, which contains 211 recommendations, is designed to achieve these goals in a systematic and sustained manner.</P>
      <P>As a measure of the Government's commitment to the implementation of this report, structures were put in place at national, regional and local level to drive the implementation process. The structures take into account the need to sustain a co-ordinated programme and a high level of engagement over a long period. These structures include the establishment of a high level heart health task force, an expert advisory forum on cardiovascular health, and an inter-divisional working group within my Department. These structures have been further complemented by regional co-ordinating committees under each health board.</P>
      <P>A sum of £12 million was provided to commence the implementation process in 2000. Each of the health boards received a financial allocation of £1 million, with the exception of the Eastern Regional Health Authority which received £3 million. The balance of £2 million was used to implement initiatives at a national level, mainly health promotion initiatives, cardiac technician training and the establishment of the Pre Hospital Care Council. At health board level, for 2000, most funding supported the recruitment of additional staff for community, hospital services as well as health promotion.</P>
      <P>In 2001, an additional £15 million has been made available for the continued implementation of the strategy. I am confident that over the coming years the necessary funding will be provided to allow us to achieve our goals in implementing the various actions set out in the strategy.</P>
      <P>During 2001, at national level the following initiatives are progressing: a pilot programme of managed care of patients with cardiovascular disease; a working group to develop a five year action plan for the orderly development of consultant posts has been established; my Department is in discussion with the Southern Health Board to finalise the detail of the pilot project for a coronary heart attack register &ndash; CHAIR project; the re-establishment of a national cardiac surgery register is being pursued; national health promotion campaign &ndash; Ireland needs a change of heart which this year will emphasise the positive aspects of physical activity; and other Departments and members of the heart health task force are reviewing the recommendations contained in the strategy and how they can be pursued.</P>
      <P>For 2001 health boards are developing services along the following priority areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Structures and resources are being developed to support Ireland Needs a Change of Heart. Infrastructure for primary care is being put in place, including community dieticians and training for community based health professionals. The appointment of a co-ordinator of patient care is also being considered to support the implemen<Col N="1104" /> tation of protocols for patient care in the community and hospital settings. Priorities include that all ambulances be provided with automatic external defibrillators and the implementation of an information system and clinical audit programme. Resuscitation training officers will be recruited. Subject to the outcome of the working group on consultant posts, boards are to review facilities for assessing and treating patients with coronary heart disease. Health boards are developing services so that every hospital which treats patients with heart disease provides a cardiac rehabilitation service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>The primary childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children under two years of age against a number of serious infectious diseases. The present arrangements were introduced in 1995 and involve general practitioners entering into a contract with their local health board for the delivery of the programme. Under the programme parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice.</P>
      <P>Operational responsibility for the primary childhood immunisation programme lies with the individual health boards, which have appropriate regional and local management structures in place to manage the delivery of the immunisation programme. My Department also monitors the operation of the programme nationally.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the immunisation uptake rates in the primary childhood immunisation programme which are still below the target of 95%. My Department is in regular contact with the health boards at a senior level about the issues which need to be addressed in order to meet the target. Last year the Office for Health Gain organised a number of campaigns to promote the MMR vaccine and the Meningococcal C vaccine. A National Steering Committee has been established, under the chairmanship of the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board, and in a systematic way this will identify and address the difficulties which are hampering achievement of the uptake target. The committee will also consider the question of future immunisation campaigns. The committee is due to have its first meeting early in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Meningococcal C immunisation programme commenced in October 2000 with the objective of <Col N="1105" /> immunising the population up to 22 years of age. Phase 1 of the programme is targeting those at greatest risk i.e. children under five years and young persons aged 15 to 18 years. While it is as yet too early to establish the precise level of uptake being achieved in relation to the Meningococcal C vaccine, preliminary indications are that uptake is generally good. However, uptake in the third-level population is not satisfactory and initiatives to target this group including a poster campaign are currently under way. The health boards are currently planning Phase 2 of the programme, which will commence as soon as Phase 1 has been completed. This will target children of primary school age, with priority being given to those aged five to six years. This will be followed by the third phase which will address the remaining sections of the target population.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is conducting a major campaign through the media at national and local levels to advise of blood supply difficulties and to encourage more donors to come forward. Additional blood donor clinics have also been provided to facilitate donors. I am happy to report that donors have responded generously to this campaign and currently there are adequate supplies available to hospitals to meet both emergency and elective procedures. In response to another recent parliamentary question on this subject, my Department asked the regional chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the chief executive officers of the health boards and the chief executive officers of voluntary hospitals outside the eastern region to investigate the position in relation to their hospitals in respect of the period 25 January to 8 February 2001. The position is that only two health boards advised my Department that operations were postponed due to shortage of blood. Two elective operations were cancelled in the North Western Health Board. In the Western Health Board region, 38 elective operations were cancelled in Galway Regional Hospital, and five in Mayo General Hospital. No operations have been cancelled in the Midland, Mid-Western, North-Eastern, South Eastern and Southern Health Board regions. Full details are not yet available in respect of the ERHA, and I <Col N="1107" /> will forward the information to the Deputy as soon as it comes to hand.</P>
    <P>Adequate supplies have been maintained at all times for emergency procedures. The IBTS maintains regular contact with health boards and voluntary hospitals in relation to blood supplies and keep them informed of difficulties in meeting their full requirements for blood for elective surgery. The IBTS is available to hospitals to discuss strategies on the effective management of blood stocks especially when their full requirements cannot be met which occurs from time to time.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 47 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, at its meeting in January 2001 approved a draft planning brief for submission to my Department for a new transfusion centre in Cork. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department gave approval on 23 February to the IBTS for the immediate establishment of a project team to prepare a design brief for the new facilities.</P>
      <P>In addition, as the Deputy is aware, considerable investment has already taken place in the Cork centre. A new IT system will be operational shortly, which is the world-leader in systems for transfusion centres. The staff of the Cork centre have taken the lead role in the implementation of this key project. Additional IT and quality assurance staff have been appointed. A second consultant haematology post has been approved and funding has been made available for this appointment. Capital of more than £500,000 has been invested in the centre to improve facilities including the provision of a new components processing laboratory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the current controversy over testing, I recently met representatives of the Southern Health Board, and I have also met other groups involved in the health services, and listened carefully to their views. The IBTS operates in a fast moving and challenging area of the health system in which there is a full and demanding role for the board, management and <Col N="1110" /> the entire staff of the organisation at all levels. There is a responsibility on all concerned to resolve the difficulties which exist between the Cork centre of the IBTS and its national headquarters to ensure a truly national service and to progress with its core business of developing best transfusion practice for the future. I understand the board has decided to engage external human resource expertise to assist in achieving a resolution of current problems and establish an improved platform on which to move forward. I welcome this initiative and would urge staff to fully engage in this process.</P>
    <P>On 5 February 2001, I announced the issue of, A Guideline for the Transfusion of Red Blood Cells in Surgical Patients, which has been produced by the National Blood Users Group. The membership of this group, established by my predecessor, comprises blood user experts from hospitals nationally. The guideline states that the use of proven strategies that reduce exposure to donated blood should be made widely available and applied where appropriate. Such strategies include autologous transfusion techniques and surgical, anaesthetic and pharmacological approaches that reduce blood loss. My Department is currently making the guideline available to all hospitals, general practitioners and medical schools.</P>
    <P>A special board meeting of the IBTS is scheduled for today to consider further strategies to address the concerns of the possible transmission of variant CJD, vCJD, by blood transfusion. These strategies include deferral of some donors, replacement of products currently manufactured by the IBTS, including red cells, by products sourced in BSE free countries, and optimal use of blood components. These developments will have major repercussions for the core business of the IBTS.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 58 and 61 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> General practice is a central part of health care provision in this country and one to which I attach considerable importance. It is a sector of our health services whose potential I am determined to develop fully in conjunction and consultation with the relevant stakeholders in the area. That process of development will be rational and structured and be consistent with the overall objective of building an integrated healthcare service.</P>
    <P>I should begin by pointing out that in recent years, the State has become much more involved in developing general practice through direct investment and tangible practice support. Indeed, while there has been some very worthwhile investment by general practitioners themselves much of the progress made is due principally to State support. My Department and the health boards now provide assistance to general practitioners to develop their services, infrastructure and premises through the provision of a range of capital and developmental funding mechanisms.</P>
    <P>On the capital side, allocations to health boards are on the basis of submissions made by the boards' primary care units which reflect the priority projects in their areas and are consistent with strategy documents outlining the development of general practice, including the provision of integrated care services. Some units favour assisting a large number of individual projects with relatively small grant aid while others favour supporting a small number of projects with more significant aid. Similarly, some projects may be wholly owned board projects, while others may be private projects by GPs and such GPs must be drugs savers, provide equity in the projects and give commitments to safeguard the State's investment.</P>
    <P>Further funding, which may be used for capital or other purposes, is available under the voluntary indicative drug budgeting scheme, which is intended to encourage GMS scheme doctors to prescribe rationally, and thereby act, in part, as a control on drugs costs' escalation. Doctors making savings under the scheme are allowed to keep 100% of their savings for approved investment in their practices. Health boards may also provide practice support through moneys made available under the annual GP development fund together with the annual £1.2 million made available to them under the drugs budgeting scheme. In addition, there are a number of financial incentives available to participating doctors under the GMS scheme to recruit practice support staff, including practice nurses and secretaries.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that while these initiatives have greatly improved the infrastructure of primary care there remains a need to further develop general practice to ensure it can play its fullest role in the strategic development of primary care and a broader more integrated healthcare service. It was in recognition of this that the health board chief executive officers, with input from the Department, decided to carry <Col N="1112" /> out a major examination of the nature and role of general practice. The purpose of the review was to systematically identify the measures necessary to meet the challenges posed if general practice was to be properly developed. The findings of the now completed review will serve as the basis for the future strategic development of general practice. Accordingly, I plan to seek the approval of the Government to move forward on the basis of the review and to commence a major process of consultation with the relevant representative bodies, in particular the ICGP and the IMO. Their joint vision statement will also clearly form part of the consultation process.</P>
    <P>All of this is intended to ensure that progress takes place on an incremental but structured basis that has full regard to existing realities of general practice organisation, infrastructure, workload, etc. The outcome is aimed at a more complete and rationally developed general practice and primary care system, integrated with the overall health system, which meets patients' needs in a value for money framework.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have initiated a national review of bed capacity in the acute and non-acute sectors, on foot of the commitment by Government in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review is being conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. Funding of £32 million has been approved to date on foot of phase one of the review to help alleviate service pressures and to maintain services to patients in the acute hospital sector, particularly over the winter period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of phase two of the review, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, has prepared a comprehensive needs assessment indicating a requirement for 1,276 additional acute beds by 2011 to meet increasing demands. The objective of the ERHA review was to determine whether additional acute beds are required within the Eastern Region based on good standards of efficiency; population characteristics; and medical and health care developments. The ERHA assessment of need has also shown that hospital activity in the eastern region has become more efficient, evidenced by increased activity, reduced length of stay and a high proportion of day cases. However, demand is exacerbated by a steady increase in emergency admissions, winter pressures in respiratory conditions, exceptionally high occupancy levels, a steady decline in elective admissions, persistently high waiting list levels for <Col N="1113" /> elective specialities and a level of inappropriate bed days-length of stay for elderly patients.</P>
    <P>The ERHA report also identifies a need to increase the number of non-acute beds for the care of older people in the region. This is seen as essential in order to allow for increased capacity and throughput in acute hospitals. The work of the ERHA will inform the preparation of a national assessment of bed requirements. The national review will be completed in April 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991, requires every health board to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection. The Act applies to all children who are in need of care and protection regardless of their nationality or how they enter the State. The circumstances in which children are brought into the State that come within my area of responsibility range from unaccompanied minors seeking asylum, children moving from other jurisdictions who are in need of special care and protection, private foster care arrangements and foreign adoptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to unaccompanied minor asylum seekers, arrangements are governed by the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, which came into operation on 20 November 2000. Section 8(5) of the Act provides that where it appears to an immigration officer or an authorised officer in the <Col N="1114" /> Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that a child under the age of 18 years, who has arrived at the frontiers of the State or has entered the State is not in the custody of any person, the immigration officer-authorised officer is required to inform the health board in whose functional area the child is.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, which require every health board to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection, will then apply in relation to the child. The Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, also provides that the health board will determine what is in the best interests of the child including the option of whether an application for refugee status should be made on behalf of the unaccompanied minor.</P>
    <P>All health boards have nominated liaison officers who will be the contact person for the immigration officer in this regard. Draft guidelines prepared by a working group established by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of these provisions of the Act have been circulated to the health boards. The immediate and the ongoing needs of the young person including accommodation, medical, social and educational needs are followed up by a social worker, community welfare officer or project worker as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Detailed procedures for the transfer of information on children in need of care and protection when families move from one jurisdiction to another are in place. In relation to children who move from Northern Ireland an agreement reached in 1996 provides for notifications to be sent to the health boards from the relevant Northern Ireland trust. With regard to children in need of care and protection arriving in Ireland from the United Kingdom arrangements are in place to direct information received by my Department from the Department of Health to the appropriate programme managers in relevant health boards for circulation at local level. Otherwise information received from the International Social Services on children who are in need of care and protection who come to Ireland from abroad is channelled through the International Social Services correspondent in the social services inspectorate established by my Department.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware that non-national children are being placed in private foster care arrangements in different health board areas. These placements are arranged by a number of non-national welfare agencies. There is a requirement under the Children (Amendment) Act, 1957, on a person or body, proposing to foster a child privately, to notify the health board in which the proposed placement will occur, where the placement is for reward or is in respect of a non-martial child. My Department issued a circular to all health boards in relation to the placement of foreign adolescents with families in this country to promote closer co-operation between the boards and the agencies involved. The Government has put forward a number of <Col N="1115" /> amendments to the Children Bill, 1999, which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas. These amendments include provisions to strengthen the legislation in relation to private foster care arrangements.</P>
    <P>In the case of inter-country adoption the following safeguards are provided. Under the law all prospective adopters who are ordinarily resident in the State must undergo a prior assessment of their eligibility and suitability before they are granted a declaration allowing them to adopt abroad. Once prospective adopters have been granted such a declaration they may make arrangements for the adoption of a child from abroad. To bring the child they propose to adopt into the State they must obtain immigration clearance from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This clearance will not be issued unless a copy of the declaration of eligibility and suitability from the Adoption Board has been provided.</P>
    <P>In general, the adoption of the child will take place in the country of origin. In such cases, the adoptive parents will seek to register the adoption of the child with the Adoption Board on return to Ireland. The Adoption Board provides a list of recognised countries to prospective adopters and this data is regularly updated. Once the child's adoption is recognised their care, well-being and protection is covered under the child protection legislation. In addition, many sending countries seek the provision of post-adoption reports. Although not required by law, all parents co-operate with their provision. These reports are completed by health board social workers.</P>
    <P>In cases where the adoption of the child is to take place in Ireland, the same provisions apply in relation to the prior assessment of the prospective adopters and the need for immigration clearance. In these cases, in accordance with the Adoption Acts, 1952-1998, pre-adoption visits are carried out by Adoption Board social workers. Post adoption reports may also be required in respect of certain countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland's ratification of the Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption will reiterate and strengthen the existing provisions. In addition, the legislation to ratify the convention will provide for greater controls on the removal of the child from their State of origin in the first instance. The preparation of the heads of a Bill to ratify the convention are at an advanced stage.</P>

    <P>*The figure for 1999 has recently been revised upwards by 12 additional cases by the National Disease Surveillance Centre following receipt of additional cases from the Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The Health Act, 1947, and the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, provide the legislative basis for the control of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, in Ireland. The control of infectious diseases is a matter, in the first instance, for the health boards.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Working Party on Tuberculosis, which had been established to evaluate policy on the prevention and treatment of the disease in Ireland and to make appropriate recommendations, was published in 1996. The report made recommendations for the prevention and treatment of the disease. The recommendations covered a range of issues including epidemiology, surveillance, screening, preventative therapy, clinical management and laboratory diagnosis. As recommended in the report, a permanent committee, the National Tuberculosis Committee, was established to advise on a detailed national strategy for the control and management of tuberculosis and it is developing such a strategy at present. It continues to keep under review all issues concerning the control and management of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>The development of the National Disease Surveillance Centre, which was established in 1998, will enable a much improved level of surveillance of infectious disease in Ireland and the centre will assist in the continued development of strategies to control communicable diseases. Tuberculosis is one of the priority communicable diseases under surveillance by the National Disease Surveillance Centre at present. In January 2000, the National Disease Surveillance Centre produced a Report on the Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in Ireland, 1998. This was the first time that national data describing in detail the epidemiology of tuberculosis had been presented. The National Disease Surveillance Centre will shortly produce a national TB report in respect of 1999. The detailed surveillance being undertaken by the National Disease Surveillance Centre in relation to tuberculosis will enable strategies to combat the disease to be optimised through monitoring and feedback of information about trends in <Col N="1118" /> incidence; identification of high risk groups/risk factors; prompt recognition of and investigation of incidents and clusters of cases; monitoring of the effectiveness of tuberculosis treatment nationally; morbidity and transmission of infection to be minimised by early diagnosis and effective treatment; the reduction of avoidable mortality and prevent the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis.</P>

      <P>The Irish Medicines Board is the competent authority for the authorisation, supervision and control of medicinal products, including vaccines, placed on the market in this country and in the ordinary course of its work it monitors adverse reactions notified by healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical companies.</P>
      <P>Information collected through this system is an important method of monitoring drug safety in normal clinical practice, by increasing knowledge about known adverse drug reactions and by acting as an early warning system for the identification of previously unrecognised adverse reactions. Such information is vital in identifying drugs where a change in their authorisation &ndash; licence &ndash; status is required such as restriction in usage, additional warnings and precautions for use, or rarely, withdrawal from the marketplace.</P>
      <P>The Irish Medicines Board issues a drug safety newsletter which is circulated to doctors, dentists and pharmacists several times a year, providing updated information on adverse reactions and providing advice on the safe use of specific medicines. In the above circumstances, I do not see the need for the appointment of an independent inspector on vaccine safety.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The press report referred to by the Deputy states that the Food and Drug Administration in the United States has recommended a ban on blood donations from any person who has lived in Ireland for ten years since 1980. My understanding is that this recommendation was made to the Food and Drug Administration by its transmissible spongiform encephalopathies advisory committee, and that the FDA itself has not yet taken a decision on this matter. The recommendation by the TSE advisory committee was made as a <Col N="1119" /> result of its meeting on January 18 in Bethseda, Maryland, when the committee considered a proposal to revise guidelines to include potential donors who have lived an aggregate of ten years in France, Ireland or Portugal. The committee considered that France and Portugal had a higher risk of BSE than other European countries. In addition they proposed adding Ireland to the list &ldquo;because Ireland has a new vCJD case and probably frequent travel to the U.K., as evidence by that vCJD patient possibly contracting the disease in the United Kingdom&rdquo;. The committee voted on the question and the outcome of the vote was eight members in favour of the proposed deferral, seven against, and one abstention.</P>
      <P>The FDA's present guidelines ask blood centres to exclude potential donors who have spent six or more cumulative months in the United Kingdom between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 1996 from donating blood.</P>
      <P>In this country, additional strategies are being examined by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service to address the concerns about the possible risk of transmission of vCJD by blood transfusion. The principle measures for decision concern deferral of donors who resided in the UK for defined periods and the sourcing of blood products from countries which are free of BSE. The IBTS is also considering the deferral of donors who themselves have had a blood transfusion. Such donors are deferred at present for a period of twelve months after a transfusion. Deferrals of donors in such combined circumstances would reduce the current donor pool by approximately 20% to 25% which would have serious implications for the hospital services and consequently for patient care.</P>
      <P>Given the need to take full account of the balance of risks involved, the IBTS arranged a special conference on 15 February last which involved national and international experts on vCJD and blood transfusion. The conference considered existing and planned strategies relevant to vCJD and a special board meeting has been arranged for today, 28 February, to consider the outcome of the conference and decide on the most appropriate strategies in the light of the expert opinion. The IBTS will also liaise with the CJD advisory group in relation to any proposals relevant to vCJD which it proposes to implement. I have assured the board that I will ensure that it is adequately resourced to introduce new measures which are considered necessary to further improve blood safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The healthcare of immigrants is addressed in the context of general arrangements governing eligibility for public health services. Under the Health Act, 1970, entitlement to health services is primarily based on residence and means. Any person regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility &ndash; category 1, that is, medical card holders &ndash; or limited eligibility &ndash; category 2 &ndash; for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as ordinarily resident in Ireland if he or she satisfies the health board that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</P>
      <P>Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioners services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons in category 2 &ndash; non-medical card holders &ndash; are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards, including consultant services and out-patient public hospital services including consultant services. Dental and routine ophthalmic and aural services are excluded from out-patient services available. However, such treatment is provided to children who <Col N="1121" /> have been referred from a child health clinic or a school health examination.</P>
    <P>In discharging its international obligations, my Department, through the health boards, provides for the healthcare of asylum seekers. The arrangements in place are not, however, subject to residency and means criteria and such persons may avail of public health services on the same basis as medical card holders, while awaiting a decision on an application to remain in this country. As part of the initial reception process for asylum seekers, communicable disease screening is offered on a voluntary basis to such persons during their stay at reception centres in Dublin. This service is offered in the interests of the asylum seekers themselves, their families and the community generally. The uptake for the service is approximately 73% and efforts continue to achieve further improvement in uptake. The health boards in other parts of the country have also been asked to ensure that screening is offered to asylum seekers accommodated in their area and who have not availed of screening during their stay in Dublin. Other actions being taken by health boards in relation to the provision of medical services to asylum seekers, include arrangements for GP's to have access to translation services as necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996, provide a system for regulating the granting of pharmacy contracts in accordance with public health criteria. The regulations specify the criteria and procedures under which the chief executive officer of a health board shall determine the issue of new community pharmacy contractor agreements for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970. They regulate the granting of contracts with a view to bringing Ireland into line with other EU-EEA states where such controls exist in one form or another, improving standards in existing pharmacies and promoting patient access to pharmacy services in rural areas. Because of the absence of any controls in regard to the granting of contracts, Ireland has been compelled to continue a derogation from the Free Movement of Pharmacists Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations came into force in tandem with the introduction of a new contract for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970, which is proactive in promoting a quality driven service to the patient. I have no doubt that the service to patients has been enhanced as a result of the new contractor agreement which imposes obligations not in place before. A central and <Col N="1122" /> innovative element of the contractor agreement is a clause providing for a review by the pharmacist of the medicine therapy of the patient including screening for any potential drug therapy problems, therapeutic duplication, drug-drug interactions, incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment, drug allergy interactions and clinical abuse or misuse. The review also includes an examination of the rational and cost effective use of the medicine prescribed, including the choice of medicines and the potential for wastage. The contractor agreement is designed to improve the quality of services by encouraging greater investment in the pharmacy and facilitating the involvement of a greater number of pharmacists in a given pharmacy.</P>
    <P>Because of public health considerations, pharmacy services and the licensing and supply of pharmaceutical products is one of the most heavily regulated services throughout the world. I am satisfied that an unregulated system, in addition to being out of step with arrangements elsewhere in Europe, would lead to a diminution of the quality of professional community pharmacy services. I met recently with officials of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union during which,<i> inter alia</i>, the current regulations were discussed. There was general agreement that the time was opportune to review the operation of the regulations to see if they had fully achieved the desired effects and this is being undertaken as a matter of priority. The appropriate balance to be struck between public safety considerations and the general desire to remove any unnecessary obstacles to competition will be considered in the context of the review.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the objectives of the National Representative Council and in so far as they relate to health I recognise the importance of the role of carers in their care of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, there are two allowances available for carers, the carer's allowance, which is an allowance paid by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the domiciliary care allowance which is a monthly allowance paid and administered by health boards in respect of children up to the age of 16 who are so severely physically or intellectually disabled that they require care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. I was pleased to be able to make additional funding of £0.45 million available in 2001 for further improvements in the domiciliary care allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following changes will come into effect on 1 April 2001. The requirement that the handicap must have been present for six months prior to the date of application is being abolished. This <Col N="1123" /> means that from 1 April 2001 payment of the allowance will be made from the date of application. Children who normally reside in special schools or institutions and who spend periods at home, for example, weekends or holidays, will from 1 April 2001 receive a <i>pro rata</i> payment of the domiciliary care allowance.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, my Department made additional funding of £0.95 million available in 2001 to support an increase in the respite care grant in respect of recipients of domiciliary care allowance. The grant, which will be payable in the first week of June is being increased from £300 to £400 and is being extended to a second eligible child in a family in line with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs budget provision.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that the provision of appropriate support services, including home and residential respite services, is vital in providing respite to carers and accordingly, my policy is to continue to invest significant funding in these services for people with intellectual and physical disabilities.</P>
    <P>The National Representative Council also proposes an increase in the weekly rate of disability allowance to £100 which comes under the remit of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. It also proposes an Ombudsman to which people with disabilities and their families can go to resolve matters of concern to them. As the Deputy will be aware, the role of the Ombudsman in the protection of citizens' rights already extends to people with disabilities. Their final proposal is for a Minister with full responsibility for people with disabilities, a post which has been held since June 1997 by my colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State with special responsibility for equality and disabilities, at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns surrounding alcohol and young people and the health promotion unit of my Department is involved in several measures aimed at preventing some of these problems. The health promotion unit of my Department commissioned the first national lifestyle surveys, Survey of Lifestyle, Attitudes and Nutrition and Health Behaviour in School Aged Children. They provide a profile of health-related behaviours including current drinking patterns. The first <Col N="1124" /> report was published in 1999. Follow-up surveys will be conducted at four yearly intervals.</P>
      <P>Research is currently being carried out in relation to the impact of alcohol advertising on young people, the results of which are expected later this year. This research will inform future policy in this area. Education programmes have been developed so that young people may be more informed and better equipped to make informed decisions when faced with the issue of alcohol. Children are targeted through the substance misuse prevention programme called &ldquo;Walk Tall&rdquo; which was developed and delivered in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science and the health boards and the teachers. Some 95% of primary schools have now received training in this programme.</P>
      <P>Adolescents are targeted through the substance abuse prevention programme called &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; which will form part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. To date, two thirds of post primary schools have received training in this programme. The SAPP programme is also available for youth leaders working in local communities and at risk youth groups. Training is available for professionals and parents at community level through the regional health boards, with the purpose of helping long-term prevention of alcohol and drug misuse.</P>
      <P>A training initiative developed in association with the drinks industry on the responsible serving of alcohol has been established. This is a training course for those in the pub trade and hospitality industry and was developed in co-operation with the drinks industry group and CERT. Some of the issues addressed in this programme are the prevention of serving those under-age and those who are already intoxicated.</P>
      <P>A new campaign aimed at young high risk drinkers has just been launched. This campaign emphasises the choices open to young people and promotes a healthier lifestyle. The alcohol awareness campaign carries the slogan, &ldquo;Less Is More &ndash; It's your Choice&rdquo;. It promotes alternative activities to drinking and encourages people to examine their whole lifestyle. The messages of the campaign will be communicated through media reporting, local community initiatives, youth organisations, and the highlighting of best practice examples of how to tackle the problem of under-age drinking.</P>
      <P>An important element of the campaign was the development of a dedicated website, www.coolchoices.ie. The site provides factual information for young people on alcohol, myths about drinking, and facts and tips for teenagers. There is a particular focus on binge drinking and its consequences for health, relationships, life options and opportunities. Nationwide activities and initiatives will be signposted on the site and there will be links to other websites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Less is More campaign, the health promotion unit of my Department held a special seminar recently which was attended by over 100 stakeholders &ndash; health professionals, <Col N="1125" /> youth groups, teachers, parents, community groups, vintners and gardaí. At local level, the Department is working with youth leaders and health professionals in each of the health board areas to identify best practice initiatives within communities that promote awareness of alcohol to young people. Many of the health boards have already developed successful programmes to tackle some of the issues, and my Department will be supporting the continuation of these.</P>
    <P>An evaluation of the campaign will be carried out to ascertain its impact. The results of this research will inform the future direction of the campaign. I will also be requesting officials of my Department to consult with the Sports Council following the publication of the Code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children's Sport wherein it stated that sports leaders in children's sport should refrain from seeking sponsorship from the alcohol and tobacco industries with a view to progressing this recommendation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, acquired brain injury in young adults is most often sustained as a result of a road traffic accident, a sporting accident or fall. The degree of sustained disability is ultimately dictated by the location and severity of the injury to the brain and can range from being mild and, with the assistance of appropriate services, short-term to severe requiring on-going support services or constant nursing care.</P>
      <P>Individuals with an acquired injury form part of a larger client group, known as the young chronic sick. The need to provide step down rehabilitation services to deliver on-going therapeutic programmes to the young chronic sick on discharge from acute hospital care or medical rehabilitation has been identified as a priority service for development. In the case of acquired brain injury, this service will provide the appropriate therapeutic programmes to enable those with cognitive impairment and psycho-social functioning problems, including the milder syndromes of inappropriate behaviours, to make the transition from hospital to the community. Needless to say, because these conditions are generally acquired in adolescence or early adult years, significant psychological strain is placed on the family and the on-going care and support required by the individual and his or her family needs to be addressed within the community support services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For those individuals, for whom the severity of their condition is such that they are unable to return to or remain at home, there is a need for the provision of appropriate residential care, which has been identified as a requirement for <Col N="1126" /> specialised units, providing constant nursing care, for individuals with severe acquired brain injury. Such specialised units would also provide respite care.</P>
    <P>I have provided just over £92 million under the national development plan for services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including the development of step down rehabilitation and long-term care service for people with acquired brain injury.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, my Department is currently undertaking a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non acute sectors. This review is being undertaken in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. While this review is centred on the acute hospital system, it will also be identifying service requirements within the sub acute sector, including the need for appropriate rehabilitation and support services. The overriding objective will be to ensure that all individuals are treated in the most appropriate setting. The national bed review will be finalised in April, 2001.</P>

      <P>Under legislation, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board is required to notify me, as Minister for Health and Children, of its intention to increase premiums and it is open to me to direct the board not to implement an increase. The board, having complied with the legislative provisions, recently increased premiums by 6.25%.</P>
      <P>There are a number of considerations which the Board of the VHI must take into account when considering any premium increases. These include competitive pressures in the market place, the higher cost and incidence of claims, the maintenance of reserves and enhancing the benefits and services available to members.</P>
      <P>As regards the analysis presented in connection with the Deputy's question, I would point out that, the day to day operation of the VHI is a matter for the VHI Board in conjunction with its management.

      <P>Following my announcement in December 2000 in relation to the recent issue involving Medeva oral polio vaccine used in Ireland which contained human serum albumin produced from a plasma pool, where one of the donors had recently been diagnosed as having the variant form of Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease &ndash; vCJD, health boards were requested to have immunisation records examined in order to establish the extent of usage of the vaccine batches concerned. In the course of this examination, information came to light which suggests that vaccine from the batches concerned was administered after its expiry date.</P>
      <P>At my Department's request, the health boards are currently conducting an examination of records in order to establish the extent to which this may have occurred. It is not clear at this stage how vaccine may have come to be administered after its expiry date. I requested expert advice in relation to the safety and efficacy aspects of this issue from the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The committee has advised that the efficacy of the vaccine is reduced if it is administered more than one month after the expiry date and that the vaccination should, therefore, be repeated in such cases. My Department has written to the chief executive officers of the health boards advising them that parents of any children who received any dose of oral polio vaccine more than one month after its expiry date should be contacted and advised of the need to have the immunisation repeated. The health boards were asked to advise general practitioners and all other relevant health professionals of the situation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the chief executive officers of the health boards are currently establishing a national immunisation steering committee, which will address a wide range of issues relating to the primary childhood immunisation programme. This will include consideration of the protocols for administration of vaccines, whether new mechanisms need to be developed to guard against possible use of vaccine which has passed its expiry date and to ensure that vaccines are administered in accordance with best practice.</P>

      <P>I am advised that a woman who gave birth recently in the Rotunda Hospital was diagnosed as having tuberculosis. On discovering this, the hospital took appropriate action which included the isolation of the patient and subsequent transfer to an acute general hospital. Patients and staff who may have come into contact with the woman were also identified.</P>
      <P>A total of 30 mothers and their babies were identified by the hospital and offered screening. It is understood that 29 mothers and their babies have been screened to date and arrangements are being made to screen the one remaining mother and child. Screening of staff has also taken place and no case of TB has been detected, to date, among those screened. Contract tracing is also under way for mothers who may have been in contact with the identified case of tuberculosis at pre-natal clinics. There is, of course, no risk to the unborn child through the mother's contact with an infected person in the pre-natal situation.</P>
      <P>The director of public health in the Eastern Regional Health Authority has indicated that this is a routine contract tracing and screening procedure of a type which would be carried out frequently. He has also indicated that it was extremely unlikely that any case of TB will occur among the contacts. However, rigorous screening is put in place in such situations as a precautionary measure. There is a low level of TB in the Irish population and it is an eminently treatable disease.</P>

      <P>Medical certificates of cause of death have been used as part of the registration process since the introduction of the civil registration of deaths in 1864.

The medical certificates of cause of death are not part of the register and were not retained indefinitely. After the death is registered, the registrar sends the medical certificates of cause of death to the Central Statistics Office to enable it to complete its analysis. When this work is completed, the certificates are sent to the General Register Office.</P>
      <P>The General Register Office uses part of the basement of the Custom House as a secure storage area for material for which there is a low demand.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to emphasise that I am very concerned at the length of the waiting times endured by many patients for access to acute hospital procedures. The in-patient waiting list for cardiac surgery, hip replacement and cataract removal are three of the target specialities identified for specific waiting list initiative funding. As a result of the structured approach being taken <Col N="1131" /> by this Government, the overall numbers on waiting lists as at 30 September 2000, as reported to my Department by health agencies, fell by 7,198 which is a reduction of 19.5% on the end of the December 1999 quarter. This welcome reduction is a reflection of the major priority that is being attached to addressing high waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The number of people on waiting lists for cardiac surgery in December 1993, the first year of the waiting list initiative, was 1,401. The latest figure available at September 2000 is 764 which represents a reduction of 45% in the waiting list. The number of people on waiting lists for hip replacement surgery in December 1993 was 986. The latest figure available at September 2000 is 1,021 which represents an increase of 3% in the waiting list.</P>
      <P>The number of people on waiting lists for cataract operations in December 1993 was 1,379. The latest figure available at September 2000 is 2,523. The number of cataract operations undertaken annually has also increased in line with increased demand for the procedure &ndash; from 3,267 in 1997 to 5,483 in 1999, representing an increase of 68% in the period.</P>
      <P>The number of acute hospital beds has increased from 11,868 in 1990 to 12,292 at the end of 1999, the latest date for which audited figures are available. The designation of these beds, whether surgical, medical etc. is a matter for the individual hospitals depending on demand on services from time to time.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have initiated a national review of bed capacity in both the acute and non-acute sectors. I have presented the interim findings of the review to my Government colleagues and identified a range of short to medium-term investment proposals aimed at addressing identified service difficulties in both sectors. Further work is now being undertaken to develop a longer term investment strategy for the acute and non-acute sectors. The second phase of the review will be completed in spring 2001.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to report to the Deputy that since phase 1 of the BreastCheck programme commenced last year, more than 20,000 women have been invited for screening. Recent figures available to BreastCheck show that the uptake levels by women are on the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extension of BreastCheck outside the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas is dependent on highly skilled radiographers being available for screening. Because of a current shortage of suitably skilled radiographers, <Col N="1132" /> BreastCheck has taken a number of initiatives to address this issue. BreastCheck has advertised in Ireland, the UK and as far away as Australia to recruit the necessary trained staff. An attractive employment package is on offer for suitably qualified radiographers, together with the opportunity of working in state of the art facilities.</P>
    <P>BreastCheck, in conjunction with the school of diagnostic imaging at the faculty of medicine, UCD has also set up a post-graduate diploma in mammographic imaging, the first of its kind in Ireland. This joint initiative aims to increase levels of mammographic trained radiographers in Ireland and share the experiences of BreastCheck with other mammography services.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of my Department that phase 2 of the programme, which will involve the extension of BreastCheck nation-wide, should follow phase 1 as soon as is practicably possible. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice.</P>

      <P>The board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service at its meeting in January 2001 approved a draft planning brief for submission to my Department for a new transfusion centre in Cork. My Department gave approval on 23 February to the IBTS for the immediate establishment of a project team to prepare a design brief for the new facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as the Deputy is aware, considerable investment has already taken place in the Cork centre. A new IT system will be operational shortly, which is the world leader in systems for transfusion centres. The staff of the Cork centre have taken the lead role in the implementation of this key project. Additional IT and quality assurance staff have been appointed. A second consultant haematology post has been approved and funding has been made available for it. Capital of over £500,000 has been invested in the centre to <Col N="1136" /> improve facilities including the provision of a new components processing laboratory.</P>
    <P>In relation to the current controversy over testing, I recently met representatives of the Southern Health Board, and also met other groups involved in the health services. I listened carefully to their views. The IBTS operates in a fast moving and challenging area of the health system in which there is a full and demanding role for the board, management and the entire staff of the organisation at all levels. There is a responsibility on all concerned to resolve the difficulties which exist between the Cork centre of the IBTS and its national headquarters to ensure a truly national service and to progress with its core business of developing best transfusion practice for the future. I understand that the board has decided to engage external human resource expertise to assist in achieving a resolution of current problems and establish an improved platform on which to move forward. I welcome this initiative and would urge staff to fully engage in this process.</P>
    <P>On 5 February 2001, I announced the issue of &ldquo;A Guideline for the Transfusion of Red Blood Cells in Surgical Patients&rdquo; which has been produced by the National Blood Users Group. The membership of this group, established by my predecessor, comprises blood user experts from hospitals nationally. The guideline states that the use of proven strategies that reduce exposure to donated blood should be made widely available and applied where appropriate. Such strategies include autologous transfusion techniques and surgical, anaesthetic and pharmacological approaches that reduce blood loss. My Department is currently making this guideline available to all hospitals, general practitioners and medical schools. A special board meeting of the IBTS is scheduled for today, 28 February 2001, to consider further strategies to address the concerns of the possible transmission of variant CJD, vCJD, by blood transfusion. These strategies include deferral of some donors, replacement of products currently manufactured by the IBTS, including red cells, by products sourced in BSE free countries, and optimal use of blood components. These developments will have major repercussions for the core business of the IBTS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1996 we have been aware of a link between BSE in cows and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, commonly know as vCJD, in humans. In relation to the source of vCJD infection, the most likely explanation is the ingestion by humans of BSE-contaminated food. Humans may have been exposed to the BSE agent through different routes including consumption of contaminated food, contaminated pharmaceutical products, medical instruments, transplants, blood donations and cosmetics.</P>
      <P>The consumption of beef is not a risk factor for vCJD, rather it is the consumption of contaminated beef products. Current information indicates that BSE infectivity resides in brain, spinal cord and other specified risk material, SRM. The consumption of this material is high risk and exposure to BSE may only have occurred in those who ate such material.</P>
      <P>Some meat remains on carcass skeletons following deboning by conventional techniques. In the past, additional meat was removed from the skeleton mechanically. The practice involved putting the skeletons into machines, which using high pressure removed residual meat and tissues. This mechanically recovered meat, MRM, would have contained spinal cord and other SRM and was used for economy burgers, pies and other low-grade meat products. This may have been the most infective material entering the human food chain in the UK. The practice, rarely used in Ireland, was banned in May 1996. BSE was first identified in the United Kingdom in 1986. From the outset of the epidemic in the UK, Ireland acknowledged that it might have a BSE problem in the national herd and has been introducing a series of risk reduction measures since the first case of BSE was identified here in 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's BSE controls are among the strictest in the world and include a legal obligation to notify the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development of any animal affected with BSE or suspected of being affected, the culling and destruction of all herds and birth cohorts of BSE animals, the removal and destruction of <Col N="1138" /> specified risk materials, SRMs, the introduction of comprehensive and effective licensing and control measures to prevent feed mills, which manufacture rations for ruminants, from using meat and bone meal in the manufacture of feed for other species. This measure, taken here in October, 1996, effectively prevented the type of cross contamination which a number of other member states have freely admitted was still occurring in their feed mills up to last year.</P>
    <P>In September 2000, Ireland began using one of the then recently validated rapid diagnostic tests to test all casualty animals at factories and, in October, began testing a random sample of fallen animals. The EU requirement was that member states should commence this targeted active surveillance from 1 January 2001.</P>
    <P>In response to consumer concerns about food safety including the emergence of BSE, the Government decided to establish an independent, science-based consumer-oriented food safety agency, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which is accountable to the Minister for Health and Children. The FSAI was established in January 1999 and is developing a seamless inspection service from farm gate to the point of sale to consumers. Ireland's strict BSE controls are enforced by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, acting as agents of the FSAI via a service contract. The FSAI also audits the control measures in place.</P>
    <P>The Authority has also set up a sub-committee of its scientific committee to specifically address BSE issues. Deputies will also be aware of the CJD Advisory Group which advises me on all matters related to CJD, including food safety.</P>

      <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal is a statutory body established under the Health Act, 1970. The main function of Comhairle is to regulate the number and type of consultant and senior registrar appointments and to specify qualifications for these posts. The board sets its own priorities in accordance with its statutory obligations. In relation to appointments, the constitution of the Comhairle is governed by the Health (Hospital Bodies) Regulations, 1972, as amended. These regulations provide for a membership of 27, including not less than fourteen persons who are registered medical practitioners engaged in a consultant capacity in the provision of hospital services. The regulations also stipulate that all persons appointed to the Comhairle shall be selected for appointment by the Minister for Health and Children. It has been the practice over the years for each Minister to consult with a number of bodies prior to making the final decision on the appointments to the board.</P>
      <P>On this occasion, I consulted with a range of bodies including all of the health boards, voluntary hospitals, and major organisations such as the Irish Medical Organisation, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, the Irish Nurses Organisation and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. As a result, I received a large number of nominations for appointment to the board. I considered all of these carefully, having regard to the statutory requirements, the need to achieve a wide geographical spread, the value of representing a large number of consultant specialties, and the need to ensure an appropriate gender balance. In this regard, I am pleased to say that thirteen of the twenty seven appointments made to the board were women, representing 48% of the total.</P>

      <P>On 29 November last I announced details of a £5 million package of incentives aimed at attracting nurses and midwives back to work, retaining nurses and midwives in the public health service, and addressing shortages in specialist areas. As part of the initiative, I made funding available for nursing courses in specified specialised areas of clinical practice in order to address the critical shortage of nurses in those areas.</P>
      <P>In particular, I have provided funding for the establishment of new courses in hospitals outside of Dublin, including the Cork hospitals, Waterford Regional Hospital, and Limerick Regional Hospital. This is being done in order to arrest the drift of specialist nurses from the acute Dublin hospitals. The availability of new programmes in hospitals around the country will free up places in the Dublin hospitals which can be allocated to Dublin based nurses.</P>
      <P>Under the initiative nurses or midwives undertaking certain specialist courses will receive full pay while doing so. They will also be entitled to have their fees paid in full, in return for a commitment on their part to continue working within the public health service in the specialist area for one year &ndash; 12 months &ndash; following completion of the course. These arrangements are effective from the current academic year and will apply to post-registration courses in the following areas of clinical practice: accident and emergency critical care, including intensive care, coronary care, and burns, and peri-operative, including peri-anaesthesia, operating theatre and operating department.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the initiative does not cover all specialist courses and that nurses or midwives undertaking courses not included in this initiative often do so at their own expense. However, the areas included in the initiative have been identified as those where the shortage of specialist nurses is most acute. It is for this reason that I decided to concentrate the resources available to me on those areas. I am however, keeping the situation under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of my overall recruitment and retention strategy, I have introduced financial support for nurses and midwives undertaking post-registration educational courses at an annual cost of some £9 million, including payment of fees to nurses or midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student public health nurses; enhanced financial support package for student midwives and student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses or midwives undertaking specific courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; <Col N="1141" /> abolition of fees for back to practice courses and payment of salary to nurses or midwives undertaking such courses.</P>
    <P>This is in addition to the £8.5 million which was allocated to the health agencies for continuing nurse education between 1994 and 1999. Individual nurses and midwives who are not eligible for funding under the schemes announced by me may apply to their employers for funding from the separate continuing nurse education budget available to their employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputies are referring to the decision taken to make retrospective payments to those who were adversely affected by the provisions of the nursing home subvention regulations, 1993 which allowed for the assessment of circumstances.</P>
      <P>Articles 9.1 and 9.2 of the 1993 regulations allowed health boards to assess the ability of the adult sons and/or daughters of older people who applied for nursing home subventions to contribute towards the cost of their parents' nursing home care. The provision which allowed for this assessment was deleted from January 1, 1999. This amendment was made because the provisions in question were not consistent with the assessment procedures adopted in the granting of medical cards by health boards or in the social assistant payment schemes administered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, wherein there is no consideration of the financial circumstances of adult sons and/or daughters of applicants.</P>
      <P>However, I feel it is important to state that legal advice received from the office of the Attorney General indicates that there is no legal liability on the State to make retrospective payments in relation to family circumstances. Nonetheless, it has been decided that moneys should be paid to those who were adversely affected by this provision and my colleagues in Government agree. It is anticipated that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> A group representing the Department and the health boards or Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established to ensure that this process is carried out on a uniform basis as speedily as possible. However, as you can appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving, <i>inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;Think Twice Every Time&rdquo; campaign which I launched last November is targeted at men and women in the 18 to 35 year-old age group. The aim of the campaign is to help to educate, inform and empower people about their relationships and their sexuality. The principal message of the campaign is that both partners are responsible for their own and each other's sexual health. In particular, both partners must take responsibility for preventing unwanted pregnancy and avoiding sexually transmitted infection. The campaign seeks to raise awareness about a range of issues including the fertility of the body, how pregnancy occurs, the safe and correct use of contraception, the prevention of sexually transmitted infection and the effect of alcohol in relation to decision making and risk taking.</P>
      <P>In 2001 the campaign will involve a number of focused initiatives, including, regional workshops, a media poster campaign and a national seminar. Plans are also well advanced in the production of a website and a public information booklet. The campaign, which has an annual budget of £400,000, will run for an initial period of twelve months. The campaign is being implemented in partnership with the health boards, other statutory and non-statutory bodies and a variety of interest groups.</P>

      <P>I am aware from media reports of concerns expressed by the Irish Nurses Organisation following publication of the report of the commission on public service pensions on 31 January 2001. The INO has not requested a meeting with me on this matter, nor I understand has my colleague the Minister for Finance been asked for a meeting.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Government intends to make formal decisions on the Commission's recommendations following detailed consideration of the report. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides that a working group of the public service unions, relevant Departments and other appropriate bodies is to be established following Government consideration of the report of the commission to advise on the implementation of the relevant Government decisions with a view to introducing, as quickly as possible, any proposed changes in public service pension arrangements, including those for low paid workers. The Government will move to establish that working group when it has made its decisions on the commission's recommendations.</P>
      <P>The INO press statement of 1 February 2001 makes no reference to a possible re-opening of the nurses' dispute. Instead, the INO states that it is awaiting a date from the Equality Authority for a hearing on a claim, submitted under the Anti Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1974. It is clear from the statement that this is the context within which it intends to &ldquo;pursue equality for all nurses in respect of pension entitlements&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a European Food Authority was proposed in the European Commission's White Paper on Food Safety, which was published in February 2000. Following publication of the White Paper and the subsequent responses from each member state and other interested parties, the European Com<Col N="1144" /> mission adopted a proposal to establish a European Food Authority &ndash; EFA &ndash; on 8 November 2000. This is part of a wider package contained in a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and Council, laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Authority, and laying down procedures in matters of food safety. Discussions at EU level on this proposal have been taking place since December 2000.</P>
      <P>My Department is in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and other relevant Departments on the question of putting Ireland forward as a candidate country for the authority. Departments are in agreement that in considering this matter a number of factors need to be borne in mind such as the fact that one of the criteria laid down by the commission for the location of the authority is centrality and ease of access, and the existing location in Ireland of the commission's food and veterinary office.</P>
      <P>There are now four officially declared candidates, Helsinki, Barcelona, Parma and Lille. No final decision has been taken on Ireland's possible candidature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of maternity services at Dundalk county hospital is a matter for the North Eastern Health Board. The report of the review group on maternity services in the North Eastern Health <Col N="1145" /> Board which was completed in November last recommended that consultant-led maternity services at Monaghan and Dundalk should cease due to concerns about patient safety; a pilot centre for midwife-led obstetric services should be established in Dundalk; and that consultant-led delivery units should be located at Drogheda and Cavan.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that the health board decided not to &ldquo;accept in full the recommendations&rdquo; in the review group's report and that it unanimously approved the establishment of a further review with a broader remit. This further review will reflect on the potential for cross-border co-operation and the requirements of spatial planning as anticipated in the national development plan.</P>
      <P>At the request of the board, I met the chairman and members of the board on 30 January 2001 and I wrote to the chairman of the board on 5 February. In my letter I expressed my firm view that the way forward for maternity services is about putting in place services which comply with safety standards and internationally recognised best practice and I emphasised the need to ensure patient and staff safety. I also stated that it was imperative that the board establish and finalise a clear view on what services will be provided at each hospital in the region, the new services requiring to be developed and the enhancement of existing services in the light of the £160 million NDP funding which has been notified to the board. I look forward to receiving the board's proposals in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have also been advised that at a special meeting on 5 February the board further considered the question of maternity services at both Monaghan and Dundalk. In order to avoid the suspension of maternity services at Monaghan and Dundalk, the board mandated the chief executive officer to seek, as a matter of urgency, approval for the appointment of temporary consultant obstetricians to Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath Hospital groups to facilitate the continuation of maternity services at both Monaghan and Dundalk and to seek, in addition, approval for the immediate appointment of onsite paediatric cover at both hospitals.</P>
      <P>The approval of any such posts is a matter for Comhairle na nOspidéal, the statutory body set up to regulate appointments of consultant medical staff in hospitals providing services under the health Acts. In the particular circumstances and particularly in view of the need for an early decision, my Department had no objection to the submission of this proposal to an comhairle for its consideration. I understand that the board has now, in fact, submitted applications for approval to the additional temporary posts to an comhairle for consideration by that body at its next meeting scheduled for Wednesday, 28 February, 2001.</P>

      <P>The Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987 and 1990, impose strict regulatory controls on the conducting of clinical trials in Ireland. These controls include a requirement that informed consent be obtained from all persons participating in the trials.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of ensuring that the consent is valid, the Act requires (1) the consent must be given in writing and signed by the person who is to be the participant in the trial; (2) the person consenting is capable of comprehending the nature, significance and scope of his consent; and (3) the consent is obtained by or on behalf of the person conducting the trial.</P>
      <P>The Act requires that in obtaining informed consent the participant is made aware of the following matters: the objectives of the trial; the manner in which the substance or preparation is proposed to be administered; the risks and any discomfort involved in and the possible side effects of the trial; and whether or not the trial will involve the administration of placebos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's particular concern about psychiatric patients, I assure her that there are special provisions applying under the Act in the case of all patients who are unable, for practi<Col N="1148" /> cal and other reasons, to give their written and signed consent. These provisions require (a) where the patient is capable of comprehending the significance of his consent, he can give his consent to the doctor treating him for that illness in any other manner provided it is clearly given and in the presence of two witnesses who are present at the same time, in such cases the consent must be expressed in writing and be attested by the signature of the two witnesses; and (b) where the patient is incapable of comprehending the significance of the consent to be given, he can only participate in the trial if written and signed consent to such participation is obtained from a person, or persons, who in the opinion of the Ethics Committee is or are competent to give such consent on his behalf. Such a person or persons must be independent of the person arranging to conduct the trial and of the doctor or dentist conducting the trial.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that in both these instances it is not permissible to conduct a clinical trial unless the substance or preparation under trial is to be administered for the purpose of saving the life of the patient, restoring his health, alleviating his condition or relieving his suffering. These safeguards were specifically provided to protect the interests of all patients, particularly those with a mental illness, referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy is aware of any instances of clinical trials being carried out on psychiatric patients without appropriate consent having being obtained, I would be grateful if she could supply me with the relevant details. I can assure the Deputy that upon receipt of such information the matter will be investigated.</P>

      <P>The Southern Health Board is the body responsible for the provision of health services within its functional area. The board has advised that the position with regard to the treatment of couples <Col N="1149" /> with infertility problems within its area is that, in addition to facilities available at Tralee General Hospital for investigation and treatment of infertility problems, there is an intra-uterine insemination service available at Cork University Hospital. This service was developed by Professor Jenkins, former Professor of Obstetrics with the Southern Health Board, who retired last year. If a woman is not suitable for this treatment or if it is unsuccessful, she will be referred to the HARI Institute in Dublin, the Regional Fertility Centre in University College Hospital, Galway, or the Infertility Centre in Belfast for IVF.</P>
      <P>Since Professor Jenkins's retirement, the service has been provided by a locum consultant obstetrician. However, this individual is about to take up a permanent post in Tralee and the successful candidate for the post of professor of obstetrics has a special interest in areas other than infertility. Accordingly, with a view to addressing the resulting gap in the service, the board has indicated it will bring forward and expedite its proposal to submit an application to my Department seeking funding for a new post of consultant obstetrician with a special interest in IVF. The application will be submitted within the next few weeks. When such an application, which is subject to approval by Comhairle na nOspidéal, is made to my Department, it is considered in the context of available resources and the priority accorded to it by the health board.</P>

      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department is continuing to undertake and develop a broad <Col N="1150" /> range of initiatives in line with the aims and objectives set out in the National Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005. The strategy calls for action aimed at key population groups, such as, men's health, youth health and traveller health and particular topic areas, such as, smoking, alcohol, sexual health and established settings such as, the workplace, schools, health sector and the community. The unit will also continue to support voluntary organisations concerned with the promotion of population health and will continue its involvement in research and evaluation of health promotion related topics.</P>

      <P>The Health (Community Pharmacy Contractor Agreement) Regulations, 1996, provide a system for regulating the granting of pharmacy contracts in accordance with public health criteria. The regulations specify the criteria and procedures under which the chief executive officer of a health board shall determine the issue of new community pharmacy contractor agreements for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970. They regulate the granting of contracts with a view to (1) bringing Ireland into line with other EU-EEA states where such controls exist in one form or another; (2) improving standards in existing pharmacies; and (3) promoting patient access to pharmacy services in rural areas. Because of the absence of any controls in regard to the granting of contracts, Ireland has been compelled to continue a derogation from the Free Movement of Pharmacists Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations came into force in tandem with the introduction of a new contract for the provision of community pharmacy services under the Health Act, 1970, which is pro-active in promoting a quality driven service to the patient. I have no doubt that the service to patients has been enhanced as a result of the new contractor agreement which imposes obligations not in place before. A central and innovative element of the contractor agreement is a clause providing for a review by the pharmacist of the medicine therapy of the patient including screening for any potential drug therapy problems, therapeutic duplication, drug-drug interactions, incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment, drug allergy interactions and clinical abuse or misuse. The review also includes an examination of the rational and cost effective use of the medicine prescribed, including the choice of medicines and the potential for wastage. The contractor agreement is designed to improve the quality of services by encouraging greater investment in the <Col N="1151" /> pharmacy and facilitating the involvement of a greater number of pharmacists in a given pharmacy.</P>
    <P>Because of public health considerations, pharmacy services and the licensing and supply of pharmaceutical products is one of the most heavily regulated services throughout the world. I am satisfied that an unregulated system, in addition to being out of step with arrangements elsewhere in Europe, would lead to a diminution of the quality of professional community pharmacy services. I met recently with officials of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union during which, <i>inter alia</i>, the current regulations were discussed. There was general agreement that the time was opportune to review the operation of the regulations to see if they had fully achieved the desired effects and this is being undertaken as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>The appropriate balance to be struck between public safety considerations and the general desire to remove any unnecessary obstacles to competition will be considered in the context of the review.</P>

      <P>There is, at this stage, quite a considerable body of largely EU-led legislation directed at protecting the health, safety and economic interests of consumers. Responsibility for this legislation is spread over a number of Government Departments, having regard to their respective policy remits.</P>
      <P>My Department is responsible for the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2000 (S.I. No. 92 of 2000). These regulations give effect to EU labelling rules of a general nature that apply to all foodstuffs. A codified text of the relevant EU rules is contained in European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/13/EC of 13 March 2000.</P>
      <P>The regulations apply to all foodstuffs placed for sale on the Irish market, with the exception of foodstuffs pre-packaged on a retail premises for direct sale to a consumer to which many of the provisions do not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations require certain specific information to be provided on the labelling of prepackaged foodstuffs, including the list of ingredients. If nuts are ingredients of a product they must be included in this list. Furthermore, if the presence of nuts is emphasised on the labelling or in the name of the product then the quantity must <Col N="1152" /> generally be indicated. However, where a compound ingredient constitutes less than 25% of the finished product the make-up of that compound ingredient does not have to be shown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that the final report of the action group on small powered recreational craft, including personal watercraft, which was presented to me in April 2000, recommended the introduction of a new legislative framework to allow for the enactment by local authorities of by-laws to control the use of jet skis and fast power craft as an initial step and also for regulations on national provisions governing the safe use of such craft.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this legislative framework has now been achieved through amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, which were included in the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act, 2000. The result of these amendments is that the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is now empowered to introduce statutory regulations to take account not only of the safety of recreational craft, including jet skis and fast power craft, and their occupants, but also the safety of other persons resulting from the use of the craft and any disturbance or nuisance caused by their usage. Significantly, the Minister is also empowered to provide local authorities and bodies with the power to introduce by-laws to control the use of such craft in areas under their jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently in the process of drafting regulations which will allow for the enactment of such by-laws. These regulations will also include, <i>inter alia</i>, provisions relating to age restrictions, the carriage and use of life jackets, restrictions on the use of alcohol and drugs as well as provisions relating to careless and dangerous driving of jet skis and fast power craft. It is my intention that these draft regulations will be finalised shortly in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, with a view to their implementation in time for the coming summer season.</P>

      <P>I have no function in this matter; it is a day to day matter for the board of Iarnród Éireann. However, Iarnród Éireann inform me that it introduced a new DART service to Malahide in mid-December last, following the placing into service of ten additional DART carriages. Following the introduction of the new timetable, I received numerous complaints from Iarnród Éireann customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised these concerns with Iarnród Éireann and I was informed by the company that there are capacity constraints in relation to the frequency of trains which can safely use the rail <Col N="1160" /> track network on the northern suburban rail line into the city centre. Iarnród Éireann inform me that the position is set to improve towards the end of April when a further 16 new DART carriages are commissioned. In the meantime, additional drivers will have been recruited and trained which will enhance reliability. In all, there will be an increase of almost 30% in DART capacity compared to November last.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has acknowledged the inconvenience caused by the introduction of the new timetable and has met local public representatives and local groups to look at ways of addressing their concerns. I understand it is now planning some further adjustments to timetables in response to concerns raised and these should be announced shortly. Iarnród Éireann also acknowledge the need for better communications with its customers at the time of changes in service and in the event of disruption and is committed to a renewed customer focus as developments take place in these services in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>To cater for general growth in demand for DART services over the coming years, the national development plan provides for a further 12 new DART carriages to be delivered to Iarnród Éireann in the last quarter of this year which, when operational in late spring 2002, will result in an increase in the capacity of DART services by over 40% in the period since November last. In addition, Iarnród Éireann has an option on a further 36 new DART carriages. Plans are in hand to extend all DART platforms to accommodate eight carriage trains. Iarnród Éireann recently submitted to me proposals for a major investment project to increase the frequency of trains on the northern suburban rail network by providing enhanced signalling, all eight car trains, improved power supply on the overhead power lines and the upgrading of the current two track system to three tracks. These proposals are now being examined.</P>

Iarnród Éireann has commenced the procurement process for acquiring these carriages and expects to place the orders later this year, with a delivery date of within three years.</P>

      <P>An application was received in September 1998 from the party in question who wished to operate a bus service from Carrickmacross to Dundalk Regional Technical College via Kingscourt. In late 1998, the Department became aware that another bus operator had initiated High Court proceedings against the applicant relating to the alleged illegal operation of a service from Kingscourt to Dundalk Regional Technical College and in competition with a licensed service. Due to the legal proceedings, consideration of the application was suspended and this position was notified to the two parties concerned.</P>
      <P>However, in the context of my Department's review of the regulation of the bus market, legal advice received last year in relation to the processing of applications stated that there should be no unreasonable delay in taking whatever steps could be taken to process licence applications. In the light of this advice and in response to pressure from the applicant for a decision on the application, an offer of a licence to provide a service from Dún-an-Rí to Dundalk Regional Technical College with no stop in Kingscourt was made to the applicant in September 2000. The restriction regarding a stop at Kingscourt was to avoid direct competition with another licensed operator who was licensed to operate a feeder service from Kingscourt to Ardee to connect with his licensed service from Kilbeg to Dundalk Regional Technical College at Ardee.</P>
      <P>The applicant maintained that there was a necessity for a direct service to be provided from Kingscourt to Dundalk Regional Technical College. My Department considered the adequacy of the existing licensed service on this route and found that there were no grounds to offer a licence for an additional service between Kingscourt and Dundalk Regional Technical College. The applicant accepted the restricted terms and the licence was issued on 25 January 2001. My Department has acted in accordance with the requirements of the 1932 Act and policy guidelines in relation to bus route licensing. The licence issued does not allow the party in question to operate in direct competition with another licensed operator.</P>

      <P>Ireland's approach to participation in PfP was set out in the Presentation Document of 1 December 1999, which was approved by the House. The Presentation Document included the five priority areas of co-operation on international peacekeeping; humanitarian operations; search and rescue; co-operation in the protection of the environment; and co-operation in marine matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's objectives for participation in PfP include: to promote the development of a just and peaceful international society based on the rule of law, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; to foster democratic control of armed forces internationally; to contribute to development of best practice in the areas of international peacekeeping and humanitarian operations; to enhance the capabilities of military officers, civil servants and diplomats engaged in the shaping and executing of security and defence policies; to enhance the capabilities, including the area of interoperability, of Ireland's Defence Forces for peacekeeping, preventative and crisis management operations under UN mandates; to enhance the capabilities of Ireland's Defence Forces, Civil Defence and other relevant organisations to contribute to the areas of civil emergency planning; and to share information and <Col N="1164" /> expertise particularly in the area of international peacekeeping, arms control, civil emergency planning, humanitarian operations, search and rescue, scientific and environmental issues.</P>
    <P>Following on from joining PfP, a programme for Ireland's participation has recently been agreed. This is Ireland's first IPP and, therefore, provides an initial presentation of Ireland's broad approach and planned activities. Ireland's policy approach will be developed in the light of initial experience and the IPP has been drawn up in a flexible form to allow for adjustment in the light of ongoing experience. Details of the planned activities, which allow for adjustment based on policy development and the availability of financial and other resources, will be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>There are a number of provisions in the cattle premium system which are intended to encourage extensive farming practices. These include the extensification premium and the maximum stocking density on the suckler cow and special beef premiums. The latest set of proposals from the Commission includes a proposal to reduce the maximum stocking density for these premiums from 2.0 livestock units per hectare to 1.8 livestock units per hectare. If this proposal is accepted, it will be implemented by restricting the payment to the farmers with a maximum stocking density of less than 1.8 livestock units per hectare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the objectives of my Department's rural development policy, as set out in the Rural Development Plan 2000-2006, is to foster environmentally sustainable systems of production. The rural environment protection scheme is the principal means by which this <Col N="1165" /> objective is pursued. The objectives of REPS are to promote ways of using agricultural land which are compatible with the protection and improvement of the environment, the landscape and its features, natural resources, the soil and genetic diversity; an environmentally favourable extensification of farming and management of low intensity pasture systems; the conservation of high nature-value farmed environments which are under threat; the upkeep of the landscape and historical features on agricultural land; and the use of environmental planning in farming practice.</P>
    <P>REPS currently has over 45,000 participants and it is projected that 70,000 farmers will be in the scheme by 2006. The Government has made available £1.6 billion for REPS, which is co-funded by the EU, for the period from 2000 to 2006. While participation is voluntary, it is recognised that REPS has already made a substantial contribution to the promotion of sustainable food production methods and the enhancement of the rural environment.</P>
    <P>In addition, participants in other direct payment schemes operated by my Department will be required to follow good farming practice which covers a range of issues several of which relate to the protection of the environment and will further contribute to sustainable food production. My Department will shortly be issuing a publication to make farmers aware of their obligations. Good farming practice will be obligatory for participants in the following schemes: compensatory allowances, farm waste management, early retirement &ndash; where it will apply to transferees &ndash; and dairy hygiene scheme. The great majority of farmers are participants in one or more of these schemes.</P>
    <P>My Department has specific measures to promote organic farming. Participants in REPS can avail of a supplementary measure under which they receive substantial additional payments. Some £17 million has already been paid out in this way to organic farmers and I expect this amount to be considerably surpassed in the period to 2006. A further £6 million has been provided under the regional operational programmes for direct grants to organic producers and processors.</P>

      <P>Farmers participating in the rural environmental protection scheme are required to comply with detailed rules pertaining to the spreading of slurry on farmland. These rules, which form measure 1 of REPS, have regard to the recommendations of the Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates, published jointly in 1996 by my Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Farmers in REPS are also prohibited from spreading slurry within 1.5 metres of hedgerows, on bird nesting sites during the nesting period or within 50 metres of any private dwelling, school grounds, public building or amenity area.</P>
      <P>In the context of requirements for good farming practice as set out in the CAP Rural Development Plan, 2000-2006, farmers participating in the compensatory allowances and on-farm investment schemes, and transferees in the early retirement scheme, will be subject to rules governing the spreading of organic waste on farmland.</P>
      <P>The 1996 Code of Good Agricultural Practice to Protect Waters from Pollution by Nitrates is a voluntary one but I commend it to all farmers. Under its recommendations, land spreading should be carried out as early as practicable in the growing season so as to maximise uptake of nutrients by the crop and minimise pollution risks. Where heavy rain is forecast within the next 48 hours slurry should not be applied. Spreading should also be avoided on wet or waterlogged land, on frozen or snow covered land or on land sloping steeply towards rivers, streams, lakes and exposed bedrock or in situations where there is a significant risk of causing water pollution.</P>
      <P>The following buffer strips are recommended when spreading organic waste:</P>

      <P>Deputy Durkan previously brought to my attention a delay which had occurred in updating the PRSI contributions of employees in three associated companies. He explained that the delay caused difficulties for the employees in question in obtaining optical and dental benefit.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Question No. 77 on 8 February, I explained that I had been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the employers which the Deputy referred to had been late in filing the relevant return due to software difficulties with a particular payroll system. As soon as the information was received in Revenue it was processed and the employee records updated. I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been liaison between Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regarding this matter.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is aware of any other employees who have encountered similar difficulties, perhaps he could notify the Revenue Commissioners accordingly.</P>

    <P>The second phase of the flood risk mapping programme will involve the collection and inter<Col N="1168" /> pretation of hydrological and other specialist data on areas identified as being prone to flooding and determining the probabilities of the risk of and extent of flooding in those areas. This will require, <i>inter alia</i>, considerable research, amassing and assembling sufficient data to establish the causes of flooding and understanding the mechanisms which contribute to flooding in each particular area. It is only when these factors have been identified that consideration can be given to seeing if localised early warning systems, specific to each location, can be devised to alert local authorities, emergency services and individuals likely to be impacted by flooding.</P>

      <P>The disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' &ndash; tax concessions &ndash; scheme, which comes under the aegis of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, enables qualifying persons to purchase a new car every two years free of vehicle registration tax and VAT to a maximum of £7,500 if the qualifying person is the driver, and £12,500 if the passenger. In addition, the scheme provides for the refund of excise on up to 600 gallons of fuel for an exemption from annual road tax. It is estimated that the scheme cost some £22 million in 2000, excluding the annual road tax costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mobility allowance, which is a monthly payment administered by the health boards, provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings &ndash; for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. The rate of the allowance is being doubled to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April next, and it had been envisaged that from that date persons who benefit from the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers &ndash; tax concessions &ndash; scheme would be unable to also avail of the mobility allowance. By definition, the beneficiaries of the tax-based scheme have access to transport which is heavily subsidised by the State, and the object of the new arrangement is to target the increased mobility <Col N="1169" /> allowance at incapacitated people who do not enjoy these advantages.</P>
    <P>In consultation with the Minister for Finance, I have been considering this proposal in the light of concerns expressed and representations received about the impact of complete cessation of the mobility allowance on some affected individuals, and it has now been decided that while the increased rate of £90 per month will, as intended, be given only to people who are not also enjoying tax subsidies, those benefiting from both schemes should retain the mobility allowance at the existing rate of £45 per month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>From a food safety perspective, the preventative strategies in place for people with potentially fatal allergies to peanuts and other nuts relate to the labelling of products. The European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. 92 of 2000) oblige food manufacturers and packagers to label pre-packaged food informatively. These regulations fall under the aegis of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>Currently, this requirement obliges manufacturers to declare peanuts or other allergens on labels when the allergens constitute more than 25% of the finished product. There is at present no requirement on manufacturers to declare on labels where peanuts or other allergens constitute less than 25% of the finished product. This 25% rule is currently being revised at EU level. In the White Paper on Food Safety, the European Commission has announced that it intends to propose a new amendment to the labelling directive. The proposal is to abolish the 25% limit or to reduce it to 5%.</P>
      <P>There are no data available on deaths attributed to allergies involving peanuts. The data available from the hospital in-patient inquiry scheme for 1995-98 shows that 41 patients were admitted as in-patients having been diagnosed as suffering from anaphylactic shock as a result of ingesting peanuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has established a working group to examine issues such as the prevention and management of adverse reactions to foods, taking into account the main allergens, peanuts, shellfish, etc. The group aims to have a report dealing with prevention and labelling issues later this year which will heighten consumer awareness.</P>

In discharging their duties in this regard, the boards and the ERHA are obliged, among other things, to secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources, co-operate with voluntary bodies providing services in their areas and give due consideration to the policies and objectives of Ministers and of the Government.</P>
      <P>In so far as the provision of health centres is concerned, funding is being provided under the national development plan to assist in the development of new health centres and the upgrading and refurbishment of existing centres. Health boards and the ERHA have been advised of the annual indicative funding levels which will be available to them in the years 2001-06 to cover community health service capital developments. The indicative funding, which is in excess of £127 million, will enable them to plan and manage the implementation of their community health service capital developments over the lifetime of the national development plan.</P>

      <P>The mobility allowance, which is a monthly payment by the health boards, provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey. The rate of the allowance is being doubled to a maximum of £90 per month from 1 April next, and it had been envisaged that from that date persons who benefit from the disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' &ndash; tax concessions &ndash; scheme would be unable to also avail of the mobility allowance. By definition, the beneficiaries of the tax based scheme have access to transport which is heavily subsidised by the State and the object of the new arrangement is to target the increased mobility allowance at incapacitated people who do not enjoy these advantages.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the Minister for Finance, I have considered this proposal in light of concerns expressed and representations received about the impact of a complete cessation of the mobility allowance on some affected individuals, and it has been decided that, while the increased rate of £90 per month will, as intended, be given only to people who do not also enjoy tax subsidies, those benefiting from both schemes should retain the mobility allowance at the existing rate of £45 per month.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Hospital in-patient waiting list figures for the quarter ended 31 December 2000 are being collated by my Department at present. The numbers waiting for hip replacement operations at 31 December 1998 and 31 December 1999 were 1,590 and 1,383 respectively which represents a decrease of 13%. The numbers waiting for cataract surgery at 31 December 1998 and 31 December 1999 were 3,110 and 3,336 respectively which represents an increase of 7%. The numbers waiting for heart bypass surgery at 31 December <Col N="1177" /> 1998 and 31 December 1999 were 744 and 790 respectively which represents an increase of 6%.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times for hospital treatment in 2001. Dedicated funding for waiting list procedures of £34 million was allocated in 2000 to health agencies to enable hospitals to carry out waiting list procedures and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that £34.5 million has been indicated to health agencies under the waiting list initiative for 2001.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1984 the Government published, Planning for the Future, the report of a study group set up to examine our psychiatric services. The report recommended that psychiatric care should be primarily community oriented and that there should be a shift away from the psychiatric hospital being the focal point of the service. Successive Governments have supported this policy and the shift in mental health care from an institutional to a community based setting has resulted in many improvements.</P>
      <P>The report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the year ending 31 December 1999 acknowledged the progress that has been made in the provision of acute units in general hospitals, community mental health centres, day hospitals and community residential facilities. However, reference was also made to the need for progress to accelerate. In this connection I assure the Deputy that I intend to facilitate further significant development of the services under the national development plan.</P>
      <P>Approximately £150 million capital is being provided over the lifetime of the NDP for the development of the mental health services. A significant part of this funding will go towards general hospitals as a replacement of services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals. At the end of the period of the NDP, it is the intention to have the programme of acute psychiatric units completed which will mean that acute admissions to the old psychiatric hospitals will no longer occur. The plan will also provide for more community facilities such as mental health centres and community residences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, public patients have ready access to mental health treatment facilities in accordance with their clinical needs. I am committed to the provision of quality health service delivery in psychiatric services and elsewhere. My Department, in conjunction with the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, has published guidelines on good prac<Col N="1178" /> tice and quality assurance in mental health services. This document sets out a series of desirable and achievable standards of care, both in relation to the physical structures in which care is delivered and the clinical and other issues associated with providing care. This publication has been circulated to all mental health professionals and administrators in the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of school medical services as an integral component of child health services is the statutory responsibility of the health boards. As a result of the identification of the need for a review of child health services in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, the chief executive officers of the health boards initiated a review of the services in question. This review resulted in the recent publication of the report, Best Health for Children.</P>
      <P>In so far as the school medical service is concerned, the report makes a number of recommendations. The report recommends a core programme for child health surveillance for all primary schools in close co-operation with parents and teachers and with selective medical examinations of children with problems. In addition, it emphasises the need for adequate training of key professionals, provision and maintenance of appropriate accommodation and equipment and provision of appropriate referral and timely and effective treatment services as essential components of the school health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards are in the process of reviewing the child health services with a view to bringing them into line with the recommendations in the report. A sum of £800,000 was allocated to the health boards this year to assist the boards in implementing the recommendations. In addition, the chief executive officers of the health boards have established a national conjoint child health committee and appointed national child health co-ordinators for the purpose of overseeing the <Col N="1179" /> implementation of the recommendations of Best Health for Children in the health boards.</P>
    <P>The co-ordinators have indicated that the North Western Health Board began the planning phase of its pilot of the new school health service programme in its region late last year and that the pilot programme will commence over the coming months. This project will seek to develop a new partnership approach to working between the health services and schools and will also stress the importance of health promotion. Phase one will focus on primary schools in County Leitrim and Phase two will examine the development of a school health service in post-primary schools. The national conjoint child health committee will keep the Department informed of progress in relation to this pilot programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following recommendations in the Moran report &ndash; Review of Orthodontic Services &ndash; structural changes are being introduced in the orthodontic services. However, it will be some time before these structural changes impact significantly on service levels. Consequently, I asked health <Col N="1180" /> boards to develop proposals to make an immediate significant impact on their waiting lists. As a result, funds of £5.3 million have been provided for orthodontic services this year, of which £3.7 million is to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This will enable health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private practitioners to treat patients.</P>
      <P>Based on the health boards' own submissions, I expect that this initiative will have a significant impact on orthodontic waiting lists and waiting times for treatment. The health boards have advised that the ultimate effect will be to increase the numbers in treatment by 5,500 per annum and to reduce waiting times for treatment significantly. Validation of existing waiting lists will be carried out.</P>
      <P>The Department has approved a proposal from the Eastern Regional Health Authority &ndash; ERHA &ndash; for a grant in-aid scheme. Under the scheme, patients who meet the criteria laid down for non-urgent routine treatment will be given the option of availing of treatment from a private orthodontic practitioner. A grant of 50% of the board's overall estimated cost of treatment would be paid. Parents could also avail of income tax relief on the balance where appropriate. A grant of 100% of the board's estimated cost of treatment would be paid in respect of medical card holders. The scheme will operate on a pilot basis in the Northern Area Health Board for 12 months. A working group on the implementation of the scheme within the board is being established. The target date for the implementation of the pilot scheme is 1 April this year.</P>
      <P>The most recent information on waiting lists received by my Department on 27 February 2001 is as follows:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> Phase two of the major capital development programme at Naas General Hospital commenced on site in November 1999 and is programmed for completion by mid-2002. Funding for the development is provided for under the national development plan. The total cost of phase two will be of the order of £45.5 million at current estimates. Phase one of the project, the psychiatric unit &ndash; Lakeview &ndash; was completed in 1990.</P>
    <P>On completion of phase two, the hospital will have a total of 189 beds, including 25 day beds and 30 beds in the psychiatric unit provided under phase one. Phase two includes the following departments: main entrance concourse; administration &ndash; part; medical records department; chaplaincy department; out-patients department; accident and emergency department; physical medicine department (temporary location); radiology Department; mortuary-post-mortem accommodation; pharmacy department; geriatric day hospital; operating department; day services department; intensive care and coronary care units; in-patients wards; geriatric rehabilitation-assessment ward; staff changing, brought forward from phase three; on-call accommodation, brought forward from phase three; stores, brought forward from phase three.</P>
    <P>Approval to proceed with the commencement of the final phase, phase three, of the Naas General Hospital development has been given. Phase three will complete the total hospital development and will include construction/completion of the following departments: administration &ndash; completion &ndash;  pathology, hospital sterile supplies department, central supplies department, catering department, engineering/maintenance department, day services &ndash; permanent &ndash; physical medicine &ndash; permanent &ndash; out-patients department &ndash; completion &ndash; mortuary and post-mortem facilities and waste management department.</P>
    <P>The design team is finalising the sketch design for phase three and is preparing a planning application for submission to the local authority in March of this year. Construction on this final phase is targeted to commence in April 2002 with a completion date of June 2004.</P>
    <P>Progress and expenditure for phase two is indicating that the contract is 12 weeks behind programme. This is due to staff resourcing problems and exceptionally inclement weather. Every effort is being made to bring the project back on programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>People who are unable without undue hardship to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility for a medical card, the chief executive officer has regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant. Income guidelines are used by health boards to assist in determining a person's eligibility. However, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, the person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>Non-medical card holders can avail of the drug payment scheme which was introduced on 1 July 1999 with a threshold of £42 per individual or family unit. Under the drug payment scheme no individual or family unit pays more than £42 per calendar month towards the costs of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme is designed to be user-friendly and to significantly improve the cash flow for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines. I am satisfied that adequate arrangements are in place to meet the needs of persons with asthma and others with ongoing medical expenses.</P>

    <P>Funding of £7.6 million for the further development of cardiac surgery services has also been made available for 2001. I am confident that this funding will build on previous years' success in reducing the total number of adults and children on the waiting list. The cardiac surgery waiting list initiative has had and will continue to have a positive impact on the public cardiac waiting list.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> The Health Act, 1947, and the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, provide the legislative basis for the control of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, in Ireland. The control of infectious diseases is a matter, in the first instance, for the health boards.</P>
    <P>Upon being notified of a case of tuberculosis, whether in a hospital setting or in the community, the relevant health board puts in place contact tracing procedures. Close contacts of cases of tuberculosis are at increased risk of tuberculosis infection and subsequent disease. Contact tracing enables contacts to be offered preventive therapy, or if necessary curative therapy, and also enables the original source of infection to be identified and treated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recent case of a patient in the Rotunda Hospital who was diagnosed as having tuberculosis, the Eastern Regional Health Authority has advised my Department that the mothers and babies with whom the patient had come in contact have all been identified and contacted to present for screening and treatment as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The report of the Working Party on Tuberculosis, published in 1996, made recommendations for the prevention and treatment of the disease. The recommendations covered a range of issues including epidemiology, surveillance, screening, preventative therapy, clinical management and laboratory diagnosis. As recommended in the report, a permanent committee, the National Tuberculosis Committee, was established to advise on a detailed national strategy for the control and management of tuberculosis and it is developing such a strategy at present. It continues to keep under review all issues concerning the control and management of tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>The development of the National Disease Surveillance Centre, established in 1998, will enable a much improved level of surveillance of infectious disease in Ireland and the centre will assist in the continued development of strategies to control communicable diseases. Tuberculosis is one of the diseases which is the subject of detailed surveillance by the National Disease Surveillance Centre in conjunction with the health boards.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of the number of cases of tuberculosis by county is not readily available for the years 1996 and 1997. I have requested this information from the Eastern Regional Health <Col N="1185" /> Authority and will convey the authority's response to the Deputy when I receive it. The National Disease Surveillance Centre has indicated that the number of cases of tuberculosis in County Kildare in each of the last three years is as follows: 1998, 11; 1999, 25; 2000, 8 (Provisional).</P>

      <P>*The figure for 1999 has recently been revised upwards by 12 additional cases by the National Disease Surveillance Centre following receipt of additional cases from the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>The Health Act, 1947, and the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, provide the legislative basis for the control of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, in Ireland. The control of infectious diseases is a matter, in the first instance, for the health boards.</P>
      <P>The report of the Working Party on Tuberculosis, which had been established to evaluate policy on the prevention and treatment of the disease in Ireland and to make appropriate recommendations, was published in 1996. The report made recommendations for the prevention and treatment of the disease. The recommendations covered a range of issues including epidemiology, surveillance, screening, preventative therapy, clinical management and laboratory diagnosis. As recommended in the report, a permanent committee, the National Tuberculosis Committee, was established to advise on a detailed national strategy for the control and management of tuberculosis and it is developing such a strategy at present.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the National Disease Surveillance Centre, which was established in 1998, will enable a much improved level of surveillance of infectious disease in Ireland and the centre will assist in the continued development of strategies to control communicable diseases. Tuberculosis is one of the priority communicable diseases under surveillance by the National Disease Surveillance Centre at present. In January 2000 the National Disease Surveillance Centre produced a report on the epidemiology of tuberculosis in Ireland. This was the first time that national data describing in detail the epidemiology of tuberculosis had been presented. The National Disease Surveil<Col N="1186" /> lance Centre will shortly produce a national TB report in respect of 1999. The detailed surveillance being undertaken by the National Disease Surveillance Centre in relation to tuberculosis will enable strategies to combat the disease to be optimised through monitoring and feedback of information about trends in incidence, identification of high risk groups-risk factors, prompt recognition of and investigation of incidents and clusters of cases, monitoring of the effectiveness of tuberculosis treatment nationally, morbidity and transmission of infection to be minimised by early diagnosis and effective treatment, the reduction of avoidable mortality and prevent the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis.</P>

      <P>There are minimal risks to human health from the virus that causes foot and mouth disease in animals and this disease cannot be transmitted through the food chain. Foot and mouth disease is an animal health issue and the current controls in place are the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>Only in extremely rare cases is the disease transmitted to humans and in such cases it can only be passed on by close physical contact with an infected animal. Humans are only rarely infected by handling a diseased animal and infection is only temporary and mild. People do not become infected by eating meat from infected animals.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Act 1970, entitlement to health services is primarily based on residence and means. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, i.e. medical card holders, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland if he or she satisfies the health board that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.</P>
      <P>Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services and out-patient public hospital services including consultants services. The current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is £26 in respect of each day a person is maintained, subject to a maximum payment <Col N="1189" /> in any twelve consecutive months of £260. Dental and routine ophthalmic and aural services are excluded from out-patient services available. However, such treatment is provided to children who have been referred from a child health clinic or a school health examination. Attendance at accident and emergency departments is subject to a charge of £25 where the patient does not have a referral note from his or her doctor. This charge applies only to the first visit in any episode of care.</P>
    <P>The role of the health boards in relation to private nursing homes as provided for in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is twofold &ndash; firstly, to ensure high standards of accommodation in the homes, and secondly, to operate a subvention scheme towards the cost of nursing home care. Under the Nursing Homes Act, health boards are empowered to pay a subvention where a person has been assessed on the grounds of means and dependency, as provided for in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 to 1998, which set down the requirements for this assessment. It is important to point out that, subject to a means test, a person will only be entitled to a subvention if they fulfil the dependency criteria laid down in the Subvention Regulations, 1993.</P>
    <P>An expenditure review of the nursing home scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance and is expected to be completed shortly. It is my intention to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever further measures may be necessary arising from the findings of this review and the Report of the Ombudsman and experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>

Local authorities were advised that the extent of designation was, of necessity, to be limited and well targeted, and that only areas that clearly fulfilled the objectives of the plans should be designated. The award of incentives could only be justified where it could be shown that they would assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to development.</P>
    <P>Integrated area plan proposals prepared and submitted by local authorities were then subjected to detailed assessment by an expert advisory panel. The recommendations made by the panel were accepted in full and that is the basis on which designations are now being implemented.</P>
    <P>Because of the targeted, area specific nature of the scheme as outlined, the question of transferring incentives to other sites does not arise. Furthermore, each area was examined on its merits and designated accordingly. To transfer incentives as suggested would be inappropriate.</P>

The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-02, announced last July. Given the priority afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand and the funding available, it was not possible to include it in the programme at that time.</P>

      <P>There is no specific statutory provision of the type referred to by the Deputy. The main instrument for the regulation and control of physical planning is the development plan. Each planning authority is required under section 9 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, to prepare a development plan for its functional area every six years. Section 10 of the <Col N="1194" /> Act provides that a development plan shall include objectives for, <i>inter alia, </i>the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure including transport, energy, and communication facilities, water supplies, waste recovery and disposal facilities, waste water services, and ancillary facilities; the integration of the planning and sustainable development of the area with the social, community and cultural requirements of the area and its population; the development and renewal of areas in need of regeneration; the preservation, improvement and extension of amenities and recreational amenities; and the provision, or the facilitation of the provision, of services for the community including, in particular, schools, crèches, and other educational and child care facilities.</P>
      <P>A development plan may indicate that specified development in a particular area will be subject to the making of a local area plan. The making and adoption of a development plan or a local area plan is a matter for the elected members of the relevant planning authority. There is no specific population threshold in relation to the making of a local area plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 192 together.</P>
      <P>The income maintenance needs of asylum seekers are met for the most part by the health boards who administer the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on behalf of my Department. The scheme provides entitlement to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. Payment is made in accordance with the relevant social welfare legislation as long as the person is resident in the State.</P>
      <P>Where a person has access to some resources either in cash or in kind this is taken into account in determining entitlement to Social Welfare Allowance. This occurs in the case of asylum seekers who are being provided with full board accommodation under the direct provision system. This is accordance with part 111 of the Third Schedule of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act which states that the value of any benefit and privilege should be assessed in determining the rate of Social Welfare Allowance payable in any individual case.</P>
      <P>Direct provision was introduced on 10 April 2000 on foot of a Government decision taken in September 1998 that the basic needs of asylum seekers should be met in that way. It is operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on foot of a further Government decision taken in November 1998. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has not introduced legislation to give a statutory basis to these Government decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> Guidance was issued to the health boards in April 2000 on the implications of the introduction of direct provision for the social welfare allowance scheme. The guidance included a recommendation that a reduced rate of social welfare allowance should be payable in such cases to take account of the fact that the basic needs of people in direct provision were already being met. The recommended rate of payment was £15 per week for an adult and £7.50 per week for a child. The guidance also recommended that rent supplements were not payable except in exceptional circumstances as accommodation was already being provided and that exceptional needs payments should be made where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Further guidance was given in May 2000 in relation to issues that had arisen since the introduction of direct provision mainly concerning the entitlements of those people who had either refused or left direct provision. The guidance recommended that if a person either refused or left direct provision without clear justification they are only entitled to the payment that would apply if they had availed of the direct provision offered to them, £15 per week for an adult or £7.50 per week for a child. This guidance also detailed possible circumstances which the boards may treat as exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, where a person in direct provision receives all meals and has access to other facilities such as laundry and leisure areas the recommended weekly allowance is £15 per adult and £7.50 per child. These rates are currently under review by a working group which I established to examine certain issues related to the assessment of need for social welfare allowance purposes.</P>
    <P>Asylum seekers who have not been provided with full board accommodation in direct provision and who have no other means qualify for the full standard rate of weekly social welfare allowance. This amounts to £76 per week for a single adult, £123 per week for a couple and £13.20 per week for a dependent child. Asylum seekers who arrived in the State prior to the introduction of direct provision and who live in private rented accommodation qualify for rent supplement on the same basis as other recipients.</P>
    <P>There are currently 8,598 supplementary welfare allowance claims in respect of over 14,000 asylum seekers. Of these just over 2,700 claims covering almost 4,200 people are in respect of people in direct provision. A breakdown of asylum seekers by health board area is set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
    <P>Number of asylum seekers in direct provision and the number outside of direct provision by health board area based on numbers at 16 February 2001.<Col N="1197" /></P>

      <P>The Broadcasting Bill, 1999, will, when enacted, under section 19, require the proposed Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to make rules requiring each broadcaster to take specified steps to promote the understanding and enjoyment by persons who are hard of hearing and persons who are blind or partially sighted of programmes transmitted on any broadcasting service.</P>
      <P>The section provides that the commission may set targets to ensure that a specified percentage of programmes use a specified means of promoting the understanding and enjoyment of programmes by such persons. The section also provides for consultation by the commission in drawing up such codes. This is the first time that the rights of persons with such disabilities are expressly recognised in broadcasting legislation.</P>
      <P>It will be a matter for the commission in consultation with interested parties to decide if minimum quotas are the way forward.</P>

      <P>In general, my Department does not directly provide financial support for the restoration of buildings in private ownership. One source of public funds for such projects is the Heritage Council, which has powers to provide advice and assistance, including financial assistance, in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage. It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, it is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995, and I have no function in relation to any decisions by it regarding the disbursal of grants.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, recently launched a grant scheme for the conservation of protected buildings, which is being administered by local authorities with funding in the order of £4 million per annum. All inquiries relating to this scheme should be directed to the relevant planning authority.</P>
      <P>Finally, the owner or occupier of a building which is determined by me to be a building which is intrinsically of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, and which is determined by the Revenue Commissioners to be a building to which reasonable access is afforded to the public, can apply under section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 for relief in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of the building. Ultimately, the decision to allow tax relief in respect of an approved building is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

    <P>The Deputy is referring to the restructuring agreements reached at the Garda Conciliation Council, under the local bargaining clause of the PESP-PCW pay agreements, which were in return for agreement by the relevant Garda associations to contribute to flexibility and change within the force.</P>
    <P>The first of these agreements, in 1994, provided that unsocial hours allowance be made pensionable from 1 January 1994 for Garda pensioners who retired on or after 1 January 1993. The other two agreements, which included an interim agreement in 1998 and an agreement following acceptance and implementation in full of the recommendations of the adjudication board, took account of major issues including civilianisation, rostering and PULSE and provided for increases in basic pay and rent, boot and uniform-plain clothes allowances.</P>
    <P>While these three agreements were contributing factors to the increases outlined, other pay increases impacted in this period. Partnership 2000 increases impacted from July 1997 to April 2000 and the first increase under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness took effect from October 2000. It is not possible to isolate the ongoing impact of the pay settlements referred to in the question from these costs and other variable factors such as operational activities, the increase in numbers in the force and fluctuations in the numbers retiring, which impact on the pay costs of an Garda Síochána. However, the increases marked with an asterisk were largely due to the payment of arrears arising from the application of these pay settlements.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals at present to change the status of the Institute of Technology in Sligo to that of a university, nor has my Department received any such proposals from the institute itself. Accordingly, no discussions have taken place.</P>
      <P>Any application for university status falls to be made under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997. Section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997, provides that the Government may, at any time, appoint a body, the membership of which shall be recommended by the Higher Education Authority and shall include international experts and national experts, including employees of universities to which the Act applies, to advise the authority on whether, having regard to the objects and functions of a university under sections 12 and 13, an educational institution should be established as a university.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, which is administered by the local authorities, and the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, which is administered by the vocational education committees, grants are tenable in respect of full time undergraduate <Col N="1204" /> courses of not less than two years duration pursued in a university or third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds in another EU member state, including the United Kingdom, with the exception of the following: (i) courses in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and teacher training courses including those leading to the award of Bachelor of Education; (ii) courses in colleges of further and higher education, other than courses which are at Higher National Diploma level or higher; (iii) courses provided in a college which are offered in private commercial third level colleges in the State, and which are validated by that college; (iv) courses in colleges akin to private commercial colleges in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the student, to whom the Deputy refers, should contact Kilkenny County Council or County Kilkenny VEC in order to determine if the course which she wishes to pursue is approved for the purposes of the grant schemes and, if so, whether she is likely to fulfil the conditions for grant eligibility. In this regard, the main conditions relate to means, age, residency and nationality.</P>

      <P>I have accepted an invitation from my counterpart, the Minister for Education of Malaysia, YB Tan Sri Dato' Musa Bin Mohamed, to pay an official visit to Malaysia. During my visit we will conclude discussions commenced on the occasion of the visit of the Malaysian Minister to Ireland in October 2000, with a view to signing a memorandum of understanding between our two Departments. The memorandum will provide for the strengthening and formalising of existing education co-operation between our two countries through provision, <i>inter alia</i>, for exchanges of academic staff, teachers, experts and students on programmes that will be of mutual benefit to both countries; exchange of information in areas of mutual interest; academic scholarships; and the promotion of bilateral programmes with institutions in both countries.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are also being made for a meeting with Prime Minister Mahathir. In addition, I will be visiting schools, universities and other educational institutions. I will also be representing the Government at the St. Patrick's Society annual ball on 17 March in Kuala Lumpur.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of the post-primary education scheme, the country is divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary centre. Recognised post-primary pupils who live at least three miles from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they reside are eligible for transport to that centre under the terms of the school transport scheme.</P>
      <P>Eligible pupils who wish to attend a post-primary centre other than their appropriate one may be allowed transport from the nearest pick-up point within the catchment area of the centre being attended. This is subject to there being spare accommodation available on the service and provided that no additional State cost is incurred.</P>
      <P>The position in this case is that the pupil in question is attending school outside of his appropriate catchment area. Accordingly, he is entitled to transport from the nearest pick-up point in that catchment area only.</P>
      <P>This arrangement is the most that can be offered as it is not open to my Department to extend the service in question or offer grant-aid as the pupil concerned is not eligible for transport to the school he is attending.</P>
