      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31 dealing with three different topics. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
      <P>In regard to the first topic I have received notice from Deputy Clune. I call on Deputy Clune to state the matter.</P>

      <P>There are three proposals to be put to the House. The first is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 22<i>a</i> and 22<i>b</i> without debate. These are the motions concerning Supplementary Estimates. Is the proposal agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I wish to give notice to the House that my party has tabled a motion of censure on Deputy Gildea following his scurrilous and unfounded allegations against my party colleague, the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen. Given that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform sat idly by and allowed these unfounded allegations to be put on record when he knew they were untrue, will the Tánaiste make Government time available today to allow me move this motion on behalf of my party?</P>
      <P>These were serious allegations and they are all over the newspapers this morning. Even though they were withdrawn, the adverse effects on Deputy Owen are manifest in this morning's newspapers. It is profoundly unfair that a Deputy should use the privilege of the House to make scurrilous and unfounded allegations and then withdraw them and walk away from any responsibility. So that we have a sense of fair play, I want an opportunity this morning to move the motion on behalf of my party that Deputy Gildea be censured for his behaviour last night.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy oppose the proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support it and I am invoking Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy oppose the proposal on the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am responding to the Order of Business. Standing Order 162 states:</P>
      <P>Any Standing Order or Orders of the Dáil may be suspended or modified...and for a particular purpose, upon motion made after a notice.</P>
      <P>That motion would be required to come from the Government. Since the Tánaiste was not present in the Chamber last night, as I and others were, to hear the scurrilous remarks coming from the Government backbencher, Deputy Gildea&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>He subsequently consulted in <Col N="1172" /> relation to it in the Whips' office with the Minister for State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks that were made, and which were so ungraciously withdrawn, if withdrawn at all, still stand on the record as we see it because we do not know what the record will show. It is essential that this matter be dealt with as urgently as possible. I ask the Tánaiste, as a Member of a coalition Government whose support is dependent on this Government Independent backbencher, whether she has a comment to make on the failure by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, her Cabinet colleague, to in any way support the office of that ministry. He sat silently in the House and allowed scurrilous remarks to be made about an office holder, remarks which he knew to be patently untrue. Has the Tánaiste raised this matter with the Taoiseach or with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>There is clearly a need to treat this matter with urgency. The privilege of this House&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy opposing the proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the proposal. The privilege that Members enjoy in this House should not be taken for granted. It should be used with extreme care. When serious allegations are made against a colleague, it is very important that the allegations are followed through and checked out and if unfounded, as seems likely in this case, they should be declared so. The House stands with a cloud over it until the matter is dealt with. This cannot be overlooked and should be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Quinn said, I was not in the Chamber when these remarks were made. I was at a budget meeting with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks should not have been made. They were unwarranted. I discussed this matter with Deputy Owen last night. The Ceann Comhairle gave a ruling. The Chief Whip, on behalf of the Government, discussed the matter with Deputy Gildea and asked him to withdraw the remarks. He has done so. I regret very much that the privilege that is afforded to Members should be abused in any way and should cause offence to Deputy Owen and her family as this has done. On behalf of the Government, I feel strongly that it should not have hap<Col N="1173" /> pened. That is why the Chief Whip communicated that with Deputy Gildea.</P>

      <P>Only the Government can suspend or change Standing Orders. The person speaking on behalf of the Government is Deputy Harney, as Tánaiste and Leader of the Progressive Democrats. It is in her gift to propose that some time later today, subject to the agreement of the Whips, time will be allocated in which the rights of Deputy Owen could be vindicated. Deputy Gildea, the Government backbencher, could then apologise for the slur that has been put on Deputy Owen's name and for the damage caused by the media reports. I am asking the Tánaiste to use her initiative to give an undertaking that time will be made available later today for a motion of censure to be moved by the Fine Gael Party to allow due and proper redress to be given to a Member of this House. It could be any one of the rest of us and it certainly could be any of the future redundant Ministers on the current Government benches.</P>

We have no method of debating this in the House today. We need Government time to move the motion of censure. The damage inflicted on Deputy Owen has been very serious. The false allegations made by Deputy Gildea under privilege are being carried on the national airwaves, but they are also being carried on most of the local radio stations. They are being carried in a manner which gives the impression of truth, even though Deputy Gildea's churlish and technical withdrawal of the allegations is also being mentioned. There is no <Col N="1180" /> possibility of our repairing this damage if these false allegations are allowed to be made over the next five or six days without rebuttal. We are putting this proposal to the Tánaiste in the interests of everybody's rights, but particularly in the interests of the good name of a long standing Member of this House, Deputy Owen, and in the interests of the credibility of the Office of the Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform. I am extremely disappointed the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform sat there last night with a smirk on his face and allowed allegations to be read into the record which he knew were untrue and did not intervene.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste's inactivity on this issue is making the Government complicit in the responsibility for the slur cast on Deputy Owen. We want Deputy Owen's name vindicated today in this House. I again ask the Tánaiste, who is recognised on all sides of this House as a fair minded person, to provide us with time today so that we can move this motion of censure.</P>
      <P>I make it very clear, in case there are concerns at Government Whip level, that our motion of censure, which is already lodged in the office, does not attach penalties. We are not asking for a suspension. We are saying the movement of the motion of censure is the penalty.</P>
      <P>We also want a platform to allow Deputy Gildea to come back into this House and do more than the technical withdrawal he indulged in last night. This is an extremely serious issue.</P>
      <P>While we were speaking here the &ldquo;Pat Kenny&rdquo; show, which has a huge audience, played the full tape again of Deputy Gildea's intervention last night. This is extremely damaging to Deputy Owen. It is not sufficient to say we can rectify it in due course. It has to be rectified now. I again ask the Tánaiste to give us time today to do this.</P>

      <P>There is a pattern to this. On Tuesday we had the running through of legislation, yesterday we had the wrong and erroneous accusations from the Taoiseach about my comments and behaviour and today we have the failure by the Government, led today by the Progressive Democrats, to give time for this motion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed the Tánaiste did not allocate time to allow me to move a motion of censure on Deputy Gildea. Deputy Gildea's apology in the House was not fulsome and he has not withdrawn the substance of the allegation he made last night, which still stands on the record. Is the Tánaiste aware of a pattern which has emerged since our return from the summer recess whereby, when motions are moved by the Opposition, members of the Government, in particular the Fianna Fáil Party, from the Cabinet down, reply by making malicious, vicious, personalised attacks on members of the Opposition? As the Tánaiste has other duties and is not always present at Private Member's time, she may not be aware of this pattern which is standard practice for her companions in Government. There is also a pattern of Government backbenchers, again in the Fianna Fáil Party, making personalised comments on the record of the House about Deputies on this side of the House, sometimes about their private lives. This happened in Mr. Haughey's time. I suggest to the Tánaiste that there is a dirty tricks department operating in Fianna Fáil&mdash;</P>

      <P>We consider the charges made against Deputy Owen last night to be extremely serious. We know and the Tánaiste has accepted that the allegations are totally unfounded. We want time in this House today to move a motion of censure on Deputy Gildea. We can only get that with Government agreement. I am giving the Tánaiste one final opportunity to give it to us. If it is refused again for the fourth time this morning, we will leave the House and take no further part in its proceedings. The Government can have the House to themselves if that is what it wants. We will not stand idly by while the reputation of one of our Deputies is traduced in the manner in which it has without an opportunity to vindicate Deputy Owen's position.</P>

      <P>When the coalition Government, of which the Tánaiste is an integral part, was formed, there was an expectation that the courage she had displayed in the past, particularly against the bullying she and Deputy O'Malley experienced in the Fianna Fáil Party under the regime <Col N="1189" /> of Mr. Haughey, which was served so loyally by some of the Members beside her, would be maintained in Government. Deputy Noonan and I have made a number of requests today. I believe we speak for everybody on this side of the House, if I may presume to speak for my colleagues in the Green Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the leaders of the three Opposition parties have made the request. The record now shows and the media is now full of scurrilous allegations against a former office holder. As a current and former office holder, the Tánaiste knows precisely what kind of experience this is. It is not sufficient for an apology to be offered at this stage by Deputy Gildea because the precedent has been set by which any Member may have an accusation of the most scurrilous kind made against him or her and at the end of the process, once the damage has been done, the accuser can withdraw it. There must be a sanction, which must be immediate and must be seen to be taken collectively on behalf of all 166 Deputies.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste has received a request from the leader of the largest Opposition party, supported by the leaders of the second and third largest Opposition parties. We are not seeking a vote or a defeat of the Government but a victory for Members of the House. The Tánaiste has declined the request. I regret that if she does not offer precisely what has been asked for four times by Deputy Noonan, I will lead my colleagues out of the House in support of the Fine Gael Leader and in support, not just of Deputy Owen who was a Cabinet colleague of mine, but of every Deputy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan asked me if I was aware of some of the comments made in debates since the summer recess. I certainly was not aware that people's private lives were being discussed in the Chamber. It is the first I have heard of the matter, perhaps I am very innocent. People, not only Members of this House, but public figures generally, are entitled to their private lives. Privacy is sacrosanct and should be preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to vicious remarks. Some of the most vicious remarks made in the <Col N="1190" /> House in the past two weeks were directed against myself and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell. We are all mature. There is robust debate from time to time. We must separate personal innuendo, which questions a person's private life or his or her integrity, from critical debate about a person's policy position even if this, too, is occasionally vicious.</P>

      <P>I will restate our position in case the Tánaiste misunderstands it. We want an opportunity, in plenary session, to move a vote of censure on Deputy Gildea. We cannot do this in Private Members' time because we do not have it today. We need Government time for which we have asked. The Tánaiste can instruct the Government Whip to give us an hour and this can be dealt with on that basis. We have not attached sanctions to the motion we have put down. We know the normal concern of the Whip is that he will lose a Deputy who has always voted with the Government and we have not attached a sanction to the motion whereby Deputy Gildea would be censured and suspended from the House. We are allowing the motion of censure when it is passed to speak for itself. We need to do this today because it is not possible to vindicate retrospectively the reputation of a Deputy when the media moves on to other issues. If this is debated next week we know what will happen given that time will have moved on. I ask, for the fifth time, that the Tánaiste instructs the Whip to provide us with <Col N="1191" /> the hour we seek to move this motion of censure and debate it today.</P>

      <P>This has been a very extensive debate during which Deputies have covered most of the key points involved. The Bill has been accepted in principle and that is as it should be. It is very valuable legislation and I am anxious to get it on the statute books as early as possible as we come to the end of the life of this Government. I am very anxious that a scheme is put in place before this Government leaves office.</P>
      <P>In concluding the debate on this Bill I acknowledge the support for its principles from all sides of the House. There has been a clear sense in the debate that the abuse of children in institutions is business which has been left over from the past, which must now be put right in the interest of justice and fairness.</P>
      <P>Many useful suggestions of amendments to the Bill have been made and I look forward to debating them in more detail on Committee Stage. There were suggestions with which I do not agree, but I assure Deputies that I will approach Committee Stage with a willingness to take on board, where practicable, proposals from all sides of the House. It is not possible in the time available to address all the issues, but they can be taken up on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>There was some objection to the language used in the Bill. Deputy Creed stated that the Bill represented a significant shift from the language of the Taoiseach's apology in 1999, in which, according to the Deputy, a tribunal was promised. I categorically state that the Taoiseach did not refer to the issue of compensation, much less promise a tribunal, at the time he made the apology to the survivors of abuse. Detailed consideration of compensation for abuse in childhood only arose following my appointment as Minister for Education and Science in January 2000. The Bill is the outcome of proposals which were brought to Cabinet late last year. There was a particular reference to the use of the word &ldquo;resident&rdquo; to refer to children who were effectively incarcerated in the institutions. I accept that certain language can seem less than understanding of circumstances, especially if it appears to diminish what for some was a very painful experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am open to suggestions about the use of language in the Bill, but, as this House needs no reminding, in dealing with legislation precise language is desirable and necessary. It is necessary in technical terms to ensure that the legislation cannot be misunderstood subsequently. If we are <Col N="1195" /> to amend the Bill to accommodate particular phrases or terms, we must avoid sowing seeds of confusion and doubt about the range and intent of the Bill as enacted. Deputy Creed raised the issue of the waiver which a claimant would execute on acceptance of an award.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of the waiver. There has been some confusion in this regard, which I would like to clarify. First, this Bill does not interfere with the right of a person who suffered abuse in childhood to take action in the High Court. Such a person can apply to the redress board and continue with legal action, or more likely, leave it in abeyance pending the outcome of the redress board process. Therefore, the person in question can either go separately to the High Court or go to the redress board and then, when he knows the outcome of that process, he can make a decision whether to proceed further with it or go to the High Court. If one is accepting the award, the normal procedure &ndash; a procedure applied in many other cases &ndash; is that a waiver applies at that stage.</P>
    <P>It is only at the point that a claimant to the board actually accepts an award that the execution of a waiver is required. It is at the point where one signs up and says &ldquo;Yes, I am taking the compensation offered&rdquo; that one signs the waiver. The option to step out and go to the courts is available right up to that moment, if that is what is desired.</P>
    <P>It is a very fair system. It lets one go the whole way. It lets one see what is being provided and then, from that point, one can make one's decision. It is very important that that is clearly understood because it is a very fair procedure. I do not think it is helpful if there is confusion because people begin to think it is intended to act against them.</P>
    <P>One cannot participate in both systems &ndash; one has to go through one or the other. We are introducing this system as a simplified system, one that will not involve harassment of the person who is making the claim. It is just to establish the facts in a simple way and to establish that the victim has suffered. Then the compensation is worked out. It is a non-adversarial approach. If one goes to court, lawyers on both sides take the person apart, and each another. It is an adversarial system. That is how it operates in this country.</P>
    <P>I went in the other direction to provide a simplified method of compensation. That is all that is involved. Nobody is trying to do anything else or cod anybody. I am too long in politics and have been involved in a number of similar matters in the past. For the vast majority of people, the system will be welcome. One will always find people who do not welcome it and they are the people we will hear from afterwards. However, I believe we are doing the correct thing.</P>
    <P>The effect of the waiver will be to terminate any litigation outstanding and to prevent civil legal action being taken with regard to the same circumstances. The rationale is simple. The claim<Col N="1196" /> ant will receive compensation for injury and will not be entitled to receive compensation twice from the same source.</P>
    <P>There has been particular confusion surrounding the effect of a waiver on criminal prosecutions. I want to make it absolutely clear that neither the redress board process nor any waiver signed by anyone will have any effect upon criminal proceedings or the powers of the Garda and prosecuting authorities to both investigate and prosecute those suspected of child abuse. The waiver has nothing to do with the criminal proceedings that may be taken by anyone &ndash; whether by the State when the DPP follows a case through, or by the victim of abuse, in which case he or she is fully free to do so. The waiver does not affect that. It is a very simple, practical arrangement. When the amount and nature of the compensation are determined, the victim can decide either to take that compensation or go to the courts. The claimant is completely free to do that. There is no question of anyone saying otherwise.</P>
    <P>We know what the court process entails. We know all the evidence and proofs, data, etc., that are needed. It is a heavy system and difficult for a person to go through. What is proposed will provide a much simpler alternative.</P>
    <P>The inclusion in the scheme of financial redress for people who, as children or young people, spent time in foster care, orthopaedic hospitals and Magdalen laundries was also urged in the House. I am considering these issues and would like to hear further debate on them. However, I urge Deputies against using this Bill, which is a proposal addressed to a particular set of circumstances, as a vehicle for dealing with every injustice and abuse committed on children and young people in the past. If we do that, I fear we will end up with a scheme that will achieve none of its objectives and will take a great deal longer to advance.</P>
    <P>Deputies also raised the issue of including children in day schools in the scheme and put forward some interesting suggestions. I set out at some length in my opening speech why I consider day schools should not be included in this Bill. The reasons relate to the nature of day schools and institutions, the latter having had total control over the lives of the children, bearing in mind the responsibility of public agencies for the schools <i>vis-à-vis</i> their responsibilities for the institutions and the powers of those bodies as regards regulation of the schools and institutions. Comparison was made with England in this regard and legal authorities were cited from that jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>It must be noted, however, that in this jurisdiction the schools are and have been privately owned. In England, the school at the centre of the case where a public authority was held liable for abuse was owned by the local authority, as are most schools in England. It would be a considerable stretch of the legal principle of vicarious liability if the mere fact that schools received public funds, taught a national curriculum and employed <Col N="1197" /> teachers with qualifications approved by the State, whose work was inspected by inspectors, could cause the State to be responsible and liable for abuse of which even parents appear to have been unaware. This is clearly an issue that we will debate further at some length on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In this context, Deputy Enright referred to the case of Donal Dunne who received a custodial sentence for child abuse. The Deputy stated that the Department of Education at the time knew that Donal Dunne was abusing children in a school and took no action. It would be negligent of me if I did not correct the record and inform this House of the actual position.</P>
    <P>In November 1998, Donal Dunne was convicted on 16 counts of indecent assault against six boys in a primary school between 1965 and 1969. Charges relating to the abuse of another boy in a different place in the early 1970s were taken into account. He received a two year sentence. The Department's involvement with the case began in 1982, 13 years after the last of the main offences occurred. In May 1982, an adult who, as a child, had been a victim of abuse by Donal Dunne wrote to the Department alleging that Mr. Dunne had abused children. The person concerned also had a meeting with an inspector of the Department. The handling of the letter of complaint by the Department in 1982 was well below what could have been expected and it was in respect of that that my predecessor, as Minister, rightly criticised the Department of that time.</P>
    <P>The letter was not acted upon in any meaningful way by the Department. At the very least, it could have referred the letter to the Garda for inquiry. The effect of this was that Dunne continued to teach unchallenged as regards his abusive behaviour until his retirement in 1985. There was, however, no evidence at his trial that any of his pupils were abused by him during this period.</P>
    <P>Without diminishing the inadequacy of the response of the Department in any way, there is no evidence that the Department's inaction contributed to the abuse of any child. The incidents in respect of which Mr. Dunne was convicted occurred long before the Department was aware of the allegations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed raised the issue of funding of support groups for victims of abuse in childhood and had concerns that some groups had been discriminated against. From the outset, the Government has recognised the valuable role which support groups play. As their name suggests, they provide support to people who are, to one degree or another, traumatised by their experiences in residential care. The groups also have a valuable role in providing information to former residents of the institutions and in encouraging them to access the services now being made available. My Department has worked closely with a number of such groups both in Ireland and the UK. In the current year, my Department will provide funding of the order of £300,000 to support the activities of these groups. The funding in the main is <Col N="1198" /> channelled through the National Office for Victims of Abuse and in the UK, two outreach workers are funded who in turn provide support and funding to support groups.</P>
    <P>The national office in Dublin is a serviced office both for victims of abuse and for support groups set up by my Department with the assistance of the Department of Health and Children and the health boards. The capital cost was almost £100,000 and the running costs amount to a further £100,000 this year. At present, the four main groups representing survivors of abuse use the services of this office and form a management committee.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties facing my Department in funding groups is that there is a tendency for groups to fragment and for new groups to form and reform. My Department in those circumstances has to have concerns about accountability for public moneys and for ensuring that the moneys are well spent for the purposes intended. It was decided some time ago, therefore, that funding would be provided only to those groups in respect of which the management committee of the national office recommended that funding should be made available. The committee is well acquainted with the operating environment for support groups, the needs of survivors of abuse and of the activities and capacity of support groups generally. In my view, this brings a reasonable level of objectivity and special knowledge to the decision to fund or not to fund any group. Those groups which have not received funding have not been recommended by the national committee. Deputy John Browne of Wexford referred to an office which has been put in place in Enniscorthy. He felt that the office should be supported and I will certainly look into that.</P>
    <P>Turning to the issue of the fairness of procedures, the concerns expressed in the House relate to the fact that a person against whom an allegation has been made will not be provided with an opportunity to put his side of the case. As I stated in my opening speech, this is a scheme for <i>ex gratia </i>payments made on a no fault basis. This is the best approach to dealing with claims dating back 40 years or more. The focus of the scheme is on injury consistent with abuse, not on the facts of particular allegations. I understand the sense of anxiety which people who worked in the institutions have about the possible implications of an award that they too were engaged in abuse. On the other hand, exhaustive inquiry into each allegation is likely in a large number of cases to result in nothing more than two diametrically opposed statements &ndash; the claimant stating that abuse occurred and the alleged perpetrator stating that it did not. It is not satisfactory that in such a situation a person who can provide objective medical evidence of abuse should be denied an award. A process of inquiry will, in many cases, be inconclusive and defeat the objective of this Bill which is to provide a quick and effective solution to the issue of compensation for injuries consistent with abuse in childhood.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> I and my Department are, however, exploring this issue further. I would like to find a way to address the concerns of people who may feel unfairly treated if not given an opportunity to defend themselves. I will also await with interest the proposals of Deputies on this matter when we come to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty here as to whether to go for an adversarial system in which a person says they were abused by someone who says they did not abuse that person. One, therefore, gets into the full panoply of legal challenges on both sides and the full adversarial system. Some people have said that may be necessary but I do not think it is. As far as we are concerned, we want to ensure that it is enough for this compensation scheme that somebody can show they have suffered, and that will be tested medically and by psychologists.</P>
    <P>Many religious feel upset because, in their case, they have given tremendous service over many years in very difficult circumstances. They do not want any taint of criticism or suspicion on them because of some individual who in the same place at the time may have carried out the abuses. It is very hard to get away from that. That applies to us, in this House, and to people in a variety of ways. Damage was done which was not discovered, and if it was discovered, it was not acted on. We are fulfilling the promise the Taoiseach made and we are going to remedy that situation to the best of our ability and in so far as we can within the systems and arrangements in place and with as little pain, trauma and suffering as possible being caused to the people who suffered abuses. That is the purpose of this Bill and why we are designing it in this way. This is not a legal battleground. We do not want a legal battleground; we want to help these people. I call on all those who feel the same way to support what we are doing because we are making amends for the wrongs of many years ago which, from a national point view, is the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>The question of deferring the debate has been raised, and I would like to comment on proceeding with the Bill. Almost all the issues were raised and repeated by Deputies in the Second Stage debate. I noted them and have them in my own handwriting and in the notes taken by officials. We seem to come back to the same issues all the time. I welcome the number of Deputies who contributed to the debate and expressed their concerns and anxiety to see something done.</P>
    <P>The last major issue on which I would like to comment is proceeding with this Bill in advance of the recommendations of the committee of experts set up to advise on amounts of awards. Much has been made of the fact that awards should be at High Court level and that the uncertainty caused by the fact the committee has not yet reported would be unfair to claimants. However, what appears to be ignored in that argument is that there is little in the way of reliable precedent as to what the High Court would award in cases like this. Referring to High <Col N="1200" /> Court awards, therefore, provides no certainty to claimants as to the level of their award. The regulations made on foot of the report of the expert group are likely to have the very useful effect that claimants will be aware in advance of making an application to the redress board of the level of award they are likely to receive. They will provide greater certainty than proceeding to the High Court.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that the enactment of this Bill will not affect people's right to proceed with litigation in the High Court if they are not satisfied with the levels of awards set by regulation. It has been implied that if the Bill proceeds without the report of the expert group, victims of abuse will be somehow disadvantaged. They will not be. They may simply disregard the redress board as a forum for settling their claim.</P>
    <P>In regard to accountability to this House, I repeat what I said in my opening speech, that both Houses of the Oireachtas will have an opportunity to annul any regulation with which they are unhappy. I do not, therefore, share Deputy Creed's view that this is an ineffective process. It is one which applies in a wide range of legislation. It is common to include in a Bill a provision whereby a schedule of payments can be made out by regulation. That regulation is laid before the House and if it is objected to within 21 sitting days it can be taken up in the House, and that applies in either House. I do not see a problem arising, although it has been raised as a problem. This will not affect the findings of the independent expert group. Rather than coming back and asking everybody around the House individually what they would do, we are setting up an independent professional body and have provided for that in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to get on with it as quickly as possible. I do not want to delay this Bill. I have been in politics for a long time and I have seen Bills delayed and not ever passed &ndash; we saw today what could happen to Dáil business.</P>
    <P>This is a crucial and important Bill, the purpose of which is to deliver compensation. There has been nothing before this that offered compensation. Here we have a comprehensive approach to compensation. I want to progress that to Committee Stage when it will be discussed line by line and passed as legislation that backs up what these people have been seeking for years. There is counselling and we have an investigation under the Laffoy Commission which are both working.</P>
    <P>There has been some argument about lawyers' fees. It was mentioned that someone received four different offers in that regard. There is always difficulty in coming to agreement with lawyers about fees. That is nothing new. It happens in parallel with everything else and the fees are eventually determined. The main thing is to ensure that the issue does not delay or prevent us from doing what we want to do. One of the political tactics adopted in this House is to agree to something in principle but to try to delay it for one reason or another. People in this House often <Col N="1201" /> suggest reasons for not pressing on too fast with legislation. I will press on as fast as I can. I will soon put legislation on disability before the House, and I will put it up to the Opposition to support it and get on with it. The Supreme Court has ruled that the House and the Administration should introduce legislation particularly in relation to disability. I will do that, not in a matter of years or months but in a matter of weeks. The process will require the assistance and the support of the Attorney General's office and of the office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. We are getting that support as a priority in relation to disability. I am anxious to go ahead with this legislation. Some people do not agree with me, but I am used to that and there is nothing unusual about it. That is what politics is about. Without disagreement there would not be politics, just a bureaucracy. When I first studied public administration many years ago, one of the first things I learned &ndash; and I did not really understand it at the time &ndash; was that politics is about differences of opinion and that if there was no difference of opinion or disagreement it would just be a question of straightforward administration. The reason we have politicians is that people have different views. We should not, therefore, be surprised in politics when people say things about us. I am still in one piece after many years because, fortunately, what people say does not really do much harm ultimately.</P>
    <P>It is important to get legislation through and not to take risks. With Christmas approaching some people want to delay on the basis that we will adjourn for Christmas and will not return until the end of January. However, soon after the return of the Dáil after Christmas, the Finance Bill must be dealt with and subsequently a very heavy programme. The people who suggest postponing dealing with these matters know very well that the programme for the remainder of this term, the longest term of any Government in the history of the State, is a heavy one. Consequently, I am not in favour of delaying the introduction of that legislation. I want to have this legislation passed to provide a means of compensating the people in question. That is what we set out to do and that is what we will do.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the concern that residence in an industrial reformatory school leads to a criminal record. In principle, I see no basis for imposing liabilities on people who as children were incarcerated in an institution because their parents could not provide for them, if this is the effect of a court order in such a case. At the commencement of the debate I strongly criticised the characterisation of children as criminals merely because they were resident in the institutions. Before making any proposals in this area, however, I would like to have the advice of my colleagues, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General. I will return to that issue again in Committee. I am very concerned about it. The last Deputy to speak was <Col N="1202" /> Deputy Jimmy Deenihan who raised that question. Other Deputies also raised it. I will look at it urgently in relation to Committee Stage and discuss it with my colleagues in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and with the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>This is an issue which relates to our past. How we deal with that past in the present is an indication of the kind of society we have become. That abuse occurred in institutions and our society failed to detect it and come to the assistance of abused children. That has been acknowledged. We must now deal with the consequences fairly and without further delay. I thank Ms Justice Laffoy for the excellent work that she and her team are doing on the legislation we passed earlier. I will do all that is necessary to ensure the early enactment of this Bill. I look forward to the co-operation of the House in doing that.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if he has had discussions with the British authorities regarding reports that persons wanted for paramilitary offences in Northern Ireland have been allowed to return without being arrested; if the Government has sought any similar undertaking from the political parties associated with paramilitary organisations, that persons exiled by these organisations under threat of death or violence should also be allowed to return; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[29237/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had a number of discussions with the British Government on how best to resolve the issue of persons wanted for paramilitary offences committed prior to 10 April 1998. As the Deputy will be aware, the Good Friday Agreement provided for an accelerated programme for the release of prisoners convicted of scheduled offences.</P>
      <P>On 29 September 2000 the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland announced that persons who had been sentenced to imprisonment for offences committed before the Good Friday Agreement, but who had left Northern Ireland before completion of their sentences could also benefit from the early release scheme. This meant that they could make an application to the sentence review commissioners for their case for early release to be considered. If successful, normal licence conditions would apply, including their liability to be recalled to prison if they became involved in terrorist activity. I understand that, as a result, a number of individuals have been able to return to Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>A further category concerns individuals commonly known as &ldquo;on-the-runs.&rdquo;  These individuals were not covered by the Secretary of State's statement because there were outstanding prosecutions and, in some cases, extradition proceedings against them. Both Governments recognised at the Weston Park discussions in July that this issue needed to be addressed.</P>
      <P>In pursuit of this, and following the decommissioning event carried out by the IRA in October, the British Government announced that it would take &ldquo;such steps as are necessary as soon as possible, and in any event by March 2002, to resolve the issue about supporters of organisations now on ceasefire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences committed before 10 April 1998.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the separate issue of &ldquo;exiles,&rdquo; the Government unequivocally condemns the abhorrent practice of paramilitary &ldquo;exiling.&rdquo;  There can be no justification for any group in Northern Ireland to override the right of all citizens to choose their place of residence freely. This fundamental right has been recognised in the Good Friday Agreement. I again call for an end to this unacceptable situation and urge the political parties associated with paramilitary organisations to make every effort to ensure all &ldquo;exiles&rdquo; can return safely to their homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a detailed response concerning the repatriation of certain individuals who committed paramilitary offences. One issue which has been most hurtful for many families in Northern Ireland has been the practical exile of family members by paramilitary groups. We have all seen television programmes on RTE, the BBC and UTV detailing the shattered lives of many families whose loved ones had to depart these shores and are still afraid to return. Could the possible return of the individuals concerned be kept on the political agenda in the context of North-South co-operation and the advancement of the political structures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the plight of those who have been forced to leave their home areas as a result of paramilitary threats or intimidation is a cause of serious concern, a point on which I agree with the Deputy. The right of those concerned to have the threats against them lifted and to return home is fully endorsed by the Government. In our communications with parties with influence on paramilitary groups, we have called on them to do everything possible to help resolve this unacceptable position, and we will continue to do so. The information on numbers is all but impossible to obtain given the nature of the problem. Neither the groups involved in making the threats nor those who receive them are likely to help to rectify this.</P>
      <P>Regarding the putting in place of measures to facilitate the return home of those exiled or to assist those who wish to remain in this jurisdiction, as recommended by the victims commissioner, Mr. John Wilson, who noted in his report that a number of those affected by paramilitary exiling reside in this jurisdiction, the Government is examining measures to alleviate their plight. This is being carried out in the context of the Government's consideration of the commissioner's report.</P>
      <P>Work has already commenced on implementing a number of the report's recommendations. The remaining ones cover a wide range of areas which fall within the competency of a number of Departments and agencies. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has taken the lead on this issue. Work based on consultations between that Department and other Departments and agencies on developing an implementation plan in respect of these remaining recommendations is coming to a conclusion. This plan should be submitted to the Government for approval shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Another issue which runs alongside the report of the former Tánaiste, John Wilson, in his role as victims commissioner is his work on the commission for the disappeared. Given the heartache suffered by many families in the North of Ireland because of the failure to locate bodies, will the Minister ensure every effort will be made to try to gather information from the paramilitary organisations which carried <Col N="1205" /> out the heinous and evil deeds of murdering the individuals concerned? The heartache still remains for families after many years. Perhaps the work of the commission for the disappeared could be augmented by seeking further information from persons in contact with paramilitary organisations to try to relieve some of the distress families have suffered for many years and, in some cases, decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments the Deputy expressed in this matter. When information becomes available which may yield results and a resolution of some of these tragic situations, all resources of the State are put at the disposal of the Garda and others. Exhaustive attempts have been made in a number of areas to try to locate the remains of victims who were murdered. This issue clearly remains as one in which many families would like to see closure by affording a Christian burial to their relatives who have been shot or murdered. The Government will work with the victims commissioner.</P>
      <P>I commend John Wilson for the outstanding work he has done in all these matters. He has extensively pursued every opportunity to try to relieve the heartache many families suffer on a continuous basis because of the failure to locate the remains of their loved ones. We will continue to pursue this matter. It has, as the Deputy said, in some cases been a matter spanning decades, not years. We will not reduce our efforts in trying to resolve this outstanding issue which is a result of violence in the North.</P>

      <P>Following the landfall of Hurricane Michelle on the southern coast of Cuba on 4 November, the United Nations disaster assessment and co-ordination team visited the country to assess the situation on the ground. Five people were reported to have died with many thousands having to be provided with temporary shelter. The Cuban Society of the Red Cross mobilised more than 12,000 volunteers who helped evacuate those at risk to temporary accommodation or to houses of relatives or friends. By 9 November, the UN reported that water supplies had been substantially restored in three out of four urban centres, including Havana, and totally restored in two others. Electricity supplies were also substantially restored to these and other areas at that time. Thanks to the ongoing work of the Cuban Government and local authorities, further progress has been made in the restoration of basic services and in the provision of shelter to those in need since that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the government of Cuba decided not to issue an international appeal in response to Hurricane Michelle, their response to it has been supported by the Pan-American disaster response unit which is run by the International Federation of the Red Cross and Crescent. A representative of PADRU was sent to Cuba to support the national emergency effort. PADRU also worked closely with the Cuban Red Cross on the ground and kept a regional logistics unit on standby in <Col N="1207" /> Panama. This work was supported by an Ireland Aid grant of £100,000 earlier this year.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to provide a further $60,000 to assist the work of UNICEF-Cuba which is responding to the immediate health needs of children in areas affected by Hurricane Michelle.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, the European Union, which is Cuba's major donor, is providing 8 million in humanitarian and emergency preparedness support for that country this year. This assistance is addressing immediate humanitarian needs as well as those of the elderly, the handicapped, mothers and other vulnerable sectors of the population. Geographically, the EU's humanitarian support concentrates on the five eastern provinces of Cuba which are most at risk due to hostile climate and remoteness along with some areas of the central provinces. In addition, the EU provides economic and NGO co-financing support which amounted to 13 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>During 1993-2000, 78 million has been provided in humanitarian aid by the EU, representing 65% of its total support to Cuba during that period. The EU is currently in consultation with the Cuban Government so as to move forward the process of providing bilateral humanitarian support into that of supporting national development. This shift in emphasis is aimed at helping Cuba to improve the living standards of its people and to withstand any future regional climatic disasters by building on a lasting, comprehensive national development strategy.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of last year, almost £6 million has been provided by the Government in assistance to countries in Latin America. This assistance is made up of emergency relief and recovery support, co-financing of NGOs and missionaries and support for human rights and democratisation. The Government will continue its support, both bilaterally and as a contributing member of the EU, for emergency preparedness, relief and recovery programmes in Cuba and other countries of Latin America. As seen in our response to the disasters in Peru and El Salvador earlier this year, and our ongoing support for recovery from Hurricane Mitch in Honduras, these countries remain particularly susceptible to climatic and other forms of natural disaster.</P>

      <P>Some time ago members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs learned that overseas development assistance allocated by the European Union is often very slow to reach those places of hardship and the people that it is meant to assist. At that time, the committee made representations through our European Commissioner, Mr. David Byrne, to ensure that whatever financial assistance is available, and has been <Col N="1208" /> allocated by the European Union, is disbursed speedily and not held up by bureaucratic delays. Is the Minister satisfied that better mechanisms are now in place for disbursing aid and relief to areas of extreme hardship where people are dying and suffering in other ways? Are the EU's mechanisms for disbursing such funds less bureaucratic than heretofore, so the entire budget is allocated each year?</P>

      <P>Concerns have been expressed regarding this issue by the foreign affairs committee and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, who has direct responsibility for humanitarian assistance programmes and the promotion of human rights internationally. The EU's Development Council deals with this issue and improvements have taken place which make the process less bureaucratic. The manner in which decisions are taken as to the extent and destination of funding has been greatly streamlined. Commissioner Patten has also raised this issue at the General Affairs Council which I attend. The Commission has a clear understanding of the need for reform in the delivery of aid so it is disbursed more speedily and expeditiously.</P>
      <P>Many demands are made on the EU Commission's budgets for this kind of activity. Commissioner Patten often makes the point that new priorities are set, and Afghanistan is a case in point. The configuration of the aid programme will have to be rearranged in the new year to meet what is now regarded as this main priority, among others. This is due to the fact that the financial perspectives up to the end of 2006 were fixed at the Berlin European Council and are not open for re-negotiation.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, there is the need to ensure that aid is delivered more expeditiously, effectively and efficiently. However, on the other hand, there is a continuing and increasing list of demands from countries to try to meet situations which arise, whether in Central America, Cuba or due to natural disasters. In addition, the international community's commitment to reconstruction in Afghanistan will require a major commitment from the EU as part of that international effort.</P>
      <P>I take the point that, regardless of where the priorities are set, or how they are modified as circumstances change, the need to ensure that aid programmes are delivered quickly and effectively to achieve greatest impact is a continuing priority for the Commission.</P>

      <P>Many of our NGOs and lay and religious missionaries working abroad, particularly in Africa, are satisfied with the mechanisms operated by the Government and, in particular, the Department as regards the allocation of funds. Perhaps the EU's mechanisms could be tailored to reflect the Department's mechanisms for the speedy disbursement of funds to countries in which natural disasters have occurred, or in <Col N="1209" /> which there is an ongoing overseas development assistance programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the appreciation of the Deputy and all Members for the work of our NGOs and missionaries in less developed parts of the world. As a smaller country we have the ability to be more flexible and to react more quickly, albeit with smaller funds, as these are bilateral programmes, as distinct from the EU's enormous budget. The EU's development assistance budget is the largest of its kind in the world.</P>
      <P>Those who work the system are acutely aware that, in terms of maintaining its credibility and, more importantly, its effectiveness on the ground, there is a need to streamline the means by which decisions are taken. Up to now there have been too many committees and deliberative bodies which examined problems and decided on allocations. These decisions have taken far too long and priorities on the ground had moved on by the time the aid was delivered.</P>
      <P>There is a recognition of the need to co-ordinate all of these activities and to work with the bilateral programmes of member states so the European contribution, whether through EU or national budgets, are maximised and dovetailed to best effect. This is a continuing issue of which we must be mindful. Deputy O'Donnell has consistently held this position and has been one of the promoters of reforms in the Development Council as a result of our experiences.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>The people of Burma expressed their democratic will in elections in 1990. However, the military refused to accept the wishes of the people. Since then, many of those chosen to represent the Burmese people have been imprisoned. There have been systematic violations of the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Burmese people by the military regime. In common with most EU partners and the majority of nations, Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with Burma because of the military regime in Rangoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the death in July of Khin Maung Myint. He was one of the youth leaders of the <Col N="1210" /> National League for Democracy and was arrested in 1997 and sentenced to eight years in prison for attempting to hold a meeting with the leader of the National League for Democracy &ndash; Aung San Suu Kyi. Reports indicated that he was in good health before his arrest. Kale prison in which he was held is notorious for its inappropriate accommodation and improper food. His untimely death further reinforces the urgency of the release of political prisoners.</P>
    <P>The visit to Burma in October of Mr. Sergio Pinheiro, the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Burma, and the statement he delivered to the General Assembly, provided some encouragement. In the past 12 months, there have been confidence building contacts between the military regime and the National League for Democracy. More than 160 political prisoners have been released since the beginning of 2001. However, the fact remains that 21 members of Parliament chosen by the Burmese people in the democratic elections in 1990, are among the 1,800 people still imprisoned.</P>
    <P>A high-level team from the International Labour Organisation visited Burma in September and I understand that it was reasonably satisfied with the level of co-operation received from the military regime. The purpose of the visit was to objectively assess the implementation by the military regime of measures to eliminate forced labour. The International Labour Organisation adopted an unprecedented resolution in June 2000 calling on Burma to take concrete action to implement the recommendations of a 1998 commission of inquiry which found that resort to forced labour in the country was &ldquo;widespread and systematic.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The situation in Burma is addressed on an ongoing basis by the EU. During Ireland's EU presidency in 1996, the EU adopted a common position on Burma which introduced certain restrictive measures against the regime. Since then this has been kept under ongoing review. The EU has also made known to the regime and others its readiness to assist in promoting dialogue between the sides, but so far this offer has not been accepted.</P>
    <P>The UN Commission on Human Rights, the General Assembly and the International Labour Organisation have all condemned the policies and practices of the military regime. At the current session of the UN General Assembly, Ireland, together with all EU partners, is co-sponsoring a resolution on the situation in Burma. This sets out comprehensively our concerns in respect of the many matters which need urgently to be addressed there.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, appointed a special rapporteur on human rights in Burma and has tried to facilitate dialogue between the military regime and the democratic forces by the appointment of special envoys.</P>
    <P>I hope the military junta will follow up on the initial positive steps it has taken in the past 12 months and engage in meaningful dialogue with <Col N="1211" /> the democratic representatives in Burma. Together with our EU partners, Ireland will continue to impress upon the military regime the absolute necessity of a return to democratic government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the Minister's answer. However, I take it he will share the concern held on all sides of the House that in the first years of the 21st century we are stilling hearing about what is, effectively, forced slave labour. The military regime in Myanmar/Burma must rank as one of the most odious of its kind. While I accept that diplomatic efforts are being made, I hope the Minister will agree that there is a need for additional pressure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, some countries, including permanent members of the UN Security Council, consider the situation in Burma to be a purely internal one and would not consider it appropriate for discussion at the Council. There would, therefore, be no agreement to place the issue on the Council's agenda. The wider issue of slavery must be considered, however. It is estimated there are up to 20 million slaves in the world. We thought slavery was a concept belonging to earlier centuries but the fact is that at the beginning of the 21st century over 20 million people are involved in bonded labour and other forms of slavery, including the sex industry.</P>

As recently as 1998, the Burmese regime was condemned by an International Labour Organisation commission of inquiry as having been involved in the widespread and systematic use of forced labour. For that reason it is a regime with which we do not associate. The UN Secretary General is trying his level best to encourage some dialogue between the <Col N="1212" /> regime and the democratically elected members of the Burmese parliament, many of whom have been in prison since 1990, to ensure that the basic rights of the Burmese people are respected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the humanitarian situation in Iraq. Ireland, as a recent member of the UN Security Council, is committed to reform of the sanctions so as to eliminate the suffering caused to the people of Iraq. The reason sanctions remain in place is Iraq's rejection of Security Council demands that it allow UN arms inspectors to verify that it is not engaged in the production of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Iraq refuses to comply with Security Council Resolution 1284, adopted in December 1999, which established a new arms inspection body, the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, known by the acronym UNMOVIC. Resolution 1284 provides for the suspension of sanctions in the event that the Government of Iraq allows arms inspections to be renewed.</P>
      <P>To respond to the needs of the people of Iraq, the UN has progressively developed its humanitarian operations in the country. Under Resolution 1284 money from the unrestricted export of oil by Iraq is used to purchase food and medicines as well as for the repair and maintenance of essential Iraqi infrastructure. However, in his latest report of 3 October on the operation of the UN humanitarian programme in Iraq, the UN Secretary General expressed concern over Iraqi non-co-operation with the UN. This is creating serious difficulties in the effective implementation of the programme. According to the Secretary General, the Government of Iraq is in a position to address the nutritional and health concerns of the Iraqi people, particularly children. That those needs are not being met fully is due to the failure of the Government of Iraq to meet its responsibilities under the memorandum of understanding between it and the UN for the implementation of the oil for food programme. In other areas the Secretary General expressed concern at the unnecessarily harsh application of sanctions in some instances, particularly the rise in the value of holds on supplies required for the maintenance and upgrading of essential sectors of the Iraqi economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current phase of the UN humanitarian programme in Iraq expires at the end of November. The Security Council has under consideration, but has not so far reached agreement on, proposals from Britain and the United States to place the sanctions on a new basis. These would allow the free importation into Iraq of all goods except for those on a narrowly focused list of items considered to have possible military appli<Col N="1213" /> cation. The new system would remove many of the cumbersome procedures in place under the present system and greatly facilitate action in the Iraq sanctions committee in eliminating the unacceptably high number of holds placed on contracts.</P>
    <P>During my recent visits to the UN I had meetings on the situation in Iraq with the UN Secretary General, the executive director of the UN Iraq programme, Mr. Benon Sevan, and Dr. Hans Blix, executive chairman of UNMOVIC. Most recently, during my last visit to attend the UN general debate, on 13 November I met the Foreign Minister of Iraq, Minister Naji Sabri. At all these meetings I raised the prospect for the improved implementation and reform of the sanctions regime and the eventual suspension and lifting of the sanctions in the context of Iraq's agreement to allow verification by UN arms inspectors. I particularly pressed upon Iraq the need to co-operate fully with the UN in the implementation of its responsibilities under the humanitarian programme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>Co-operation by Iraq with the demands of the Security Council will make it possible for the entire issue of sanctions to be resolved. Without that co-operation there is no likelihood of the Security Council agreeing to the immediate lifting of sanctions or for changing current arrangements for UN oversight of expenditure of Iraqi oil revenues as demanded by Iraq. In these circumstances, revision of sanctions along the lines proposed by Britain and the United States offers at present the only real prospect to address the humanitarian situation and greatly reduce the number of holds.</P>
    <P>Ireland wishes to see rapid progress in the Security Council to place the sanctions regime on a new basis in time for the next roll-over of the humanitarian programme. In the negotiations which have taken place we sought support for proposals which would reduce holds, alleviate the humanitarian situation and provide as far as possible for the normal development of the Iraqi economy for the long-term benefit of the people of Iraq. Unfortunately, it has not been possible so far to reach the necessary level of agreement in the Security Council on these reforms. Ireland has been active at a number of levels in urging flexibility. The issue is due to be considered again by the Security Council at the end of this month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Iraqi regime has scant regard for international human rights and codes of best practice and for the rights of its people, is there any difference in the way the sanctions apply in the UN controlled zones in Iraq, particularly the no-fly zones? I was interested to hear him speak about his conversations with Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary General. Has the Secretary General a view on how the sanctions regime against Iraq should evolve and develop in the future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This has arisen in the context of the most recent events regarding international terrorism. The question of international peace and security is a major issue. One will recall in the aftermath of the Gulf War the UN decided there was a need for the Iraqi Government, if it wanted to return as a full member of the international community, to confirm to the international community that it does not have a capacity to use biological, chemical or other weapons. We have seen the use of those weapons against the Kurdish people within Iraq. It is also a matter of major concern to its neighbours and to the wider international community as to whether the capacity remains for the production of these types of weapons and, if those weapons are still there, that there is independent verification of the fact that they are no longer there. If, as is contended, the Iraqi Government believes it no longer has that capacity, it should not have a problem allowing a verification mission into Iraq to confirm that to the satisfaction of the international community.</P>
      <P>As regards the humanitarian needs of the people of Iraq, it must be recognised that humanitarian aid must be provided in those areas where the UN has the front line responsibility and ability to do so. The most recent UN Secretary General's report confirmed that it is within the capacity of the Government to provide for the nutritional needs of its people if it is prepared to work the oil for food programme as envisaged. We have supported efforts within the Security Council in respect of a proposal which has been sponsored by the United States and the United Kingdom to get all members to agree to change the way in which the sanctions regime works to allow in all goods except those on a specific basis which could have the capacity to be adapted militarily and used for purposes other than what one would have expected them to be used for in the first place.</P>
      <P>We will continue to work to try to get unanimity on the Security Council on that matter. That would be an improvement on the situation, while maintaining the principal that the new sanctions regime should be adopted to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people who are innocent. That would continue until such time as the Iraqi Government complies with the demands of the international community under the UN Security Council resolutions that it allows inspections by UNMOVIC under Dr. Hans Blix. That should be considered by the Iraqi Government. The sanctions regime could not only be suspended but lifted in the context of compliance with that Security Council resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen in the past what can happen when other regimes do not comply with resolutions. We know, for example, that a number of efforts were made by the international community in relation to Afghanistan, including the imposition of sanctions on the Taliban when it refused to hand up Osama bin Laden and the Al Qaeda network for terrorist acts against US targets not only in Yemen but also in Africa. It is important that the rules of international law are upheld in this case. We hope the Iraqi regime will <Col N="1215" /> respond to the demand of the international community to satisfy the rest of us, as it seems to satisfy itself, that it does not have this capacity.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 11 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The situation of persons seeking asylum in the South Pacific has been a cause of concern to the Government. When the situation of those people at sea in the South Pacific and seeking asylum in that region became apparent at the end of August, I asked our ambassador in Canberra to bring the concerns of the Government to the attention of the Australian authorities. I also asked our embassies to Norway and Indonesia to urge the Governments in Oslo and Jakarta to work with the Australian authorities to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>In our contacts with other countries and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, we encouraged parties to work towards a speedy resolution of this difficult situation through dialogue. The humanitarian concern has been the primary element in our approach, with the expression of the expectation that all the parties involved would fully abide by their obligations under international law. The UNHCR has made informal approaches to the contracting parties to the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, including Ireland, asking them to do what they can to alleviate the plight of the asylum seekers in the South Pacific and specifically asking if states are in a position to admit some of the persons currently in the South Pacific who have been determined to be refugees by that body as programme refugees. We are currently considering the request from the office of the UNHCR as to how Ireland can best assist the persons concerned and we hope to be in a position to provide an early and generous response to the request.</P>

      <P>An international initiative along the lines outlined by the Deputy already exists. The UN-sponsored Dialogue Among Civilisations was established in 1998 in order to foster dialogue between different cultures and to promote understanding and tolerance as a means to combat hostility and confrontation. The relationship between Islam and the West is, of course, a particular focus of this dialogue.</P>
      <P>The UN has declared 2001 as the International Year of Dialogue Among Civilisations and, as part of this initiative, the UN established a group of eminent persons to prepare a contribution to a special debate of the United Nations General Assembly. That debate took place in New York on 8 and 9 November. The General Assembly welcomed the report of the group of eminent persons entitled Crossing the Divide: Dialogue among Civilisations, and adopted a resolution containing a global agenda for action by governments, international organisations and civil society.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been an active participant in the initiative. We have assisted in the work of the group of eminent persons, of which Deputy Spring was a member. Ireland hosted a meeting of the group in Dublin in May of this year. We strongly support its conclusions and the recommendations contained in the global agenda.</P>
      <P>The follow-up to the attacks of 11 September and the fight against terrorism have helped to highlight the necessity for such a dialogue and, in particular, as stressed by the Deputy, between the West and Islam. Dialogue can and should include questioning and criticism where these are warranted. We need to build on shared values and seek to bridge differences where possible. Above all, neither side should portray the other in negative or hostile images. There should be no equating of terrorism with the Arab and Muslim world nor should Muslims see the West as a threat to their civilisation.</P>

      <P>In relation to the enlargement process and the Treaty of Nice I commend the Minister and the Government on the work of the Forum for Europe. From the Minister's experience to date, allowing for the fact that some of our honourable Members opposite have chosen <Col N="1218" /> not to participate in the forum, is he satisfied that the participation of the voluntary pillar is adequate and if the views being promoted in the forum reflect the views of the Irish population? Enlargement must proceed and it is important to explore its ramifications. It is also important that anybody who participates in this debate does so in a balanced manner, bearing in mind the findings of the report of Professor Richard Sinnott published recently in relation to the attitudes of the Irish population to enlargement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>On a related issue, is the Minister aware that throughout Europe the view of members of other European parliaments, national assemblies, is that if a referendum were held in any other member state the result would be the same as that reached here? There seems to be a disenchantment among the European population as a whole with the process of continuously coming back and adding on to the original Treaty of Rome, the SEA, the Amsterdam and Maastricht Treaties and now the Nice Treaty. There is a sense that people are jaded with being asked the same question. Will the Minister agree it is time that in the EU there was a rewrite of all the treaties in a single consolidation document which, like the original Treaty of Rome, is readable and comprehensible to the ordinary citizen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>To respond to Deputy Carey, it is important to hear all points of view in this debate, in relation to the Nice Treaty, the Forum on Europe, the future of Europe debate. The purpose of this debate is to bring clarity and information to the public, not to continue with, perhaps, propagating shibboleths or a particular view which does not bear any political reality with the situation.</P>
      <P>For example, much credence was given during the referendum campaign to the idea that enlargement could take place without the need for the Treaty of Nice to become operative. Since May it is clear that, with the recent publication of Commissioner Verheugen's report on the progress being made by applicant countries regarding the negotiations for accession to the European Union, up to ten applicant states, in his view, will be ready by the end of next year to become full members of the European Union. That being the case and given that everyone involved in the debate on the referendum confirmed they were in favour of enlargement, it is becoming the position that the institutional arrangements provided for in the Treaty of Nice to facilitate enlargement will have to be operative in order for those ten states to accede. The idea that there can be accession of a number of states at the end of 2002 without the Treaty of Nice becoming operative does not bear much reality to the situation as matters stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of our Treaty of Nice deliberations as part of the Forum on Europe which we are discussing, which I welcome, it is important that we try to examine what concerns raised during the campaign can be dealt with in a way that will allow for enlargement to take place, of which the consequence will be to allow for the Treaty of <Col N="1219" /> Nice to be ratified in all 15 member states. That requires further consideration and reflection by Ireland, but our approach has been clear. We recognise that whatever problems we have can only be resolved when that debate is completed.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Roche's supplementary, the Nice declaration points out that one of the four issues that will be dealt with, among others, in the Intergovernmental Conference planned for 2004 is the question of simplification of the treaties. I take his point that the original treaty, in its reading and comprehension, is far easier to understand than the current situation where one must check a number of treaties that amend previous treaties to find out what the position is in any given situation. Work has been done by the Commission and the European Union Institute in Florence regarding simplification. The one issue about which we must be cautious is to ensure that should there be a simplification procedure, which consolidates and-or simplifies the treaties, it does not give rise to a new jurisprudence which is at variance with the existing jurisprudence which has arisen out of the treaties and the European Court of Justice interpretation of those treaties in the past. This is a very difficult and delicate task. While we all agree with the idea of simplification and consolidation, we have to make sure in doing that we do not create more problems than we solve.</P>

      <P>The four Geneva Conventions of 1949 form the basis of international humanitarian law. The conventions, which regulate aspects of armed conflict, have acquired the status of customary international law, given that the overwhelming majority of states accept them as binding, by having become parties to them. To date, 189 states, including Ireland, have ratified the conventions. Ireland urges that it is incumbent on all parties to the conventions to adhere to their obligations under the conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Geneva Conventions seek to ensure that persons taking no active part in hostilities, including members of the armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed <i>&lsquo;hors de combat'</i> by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely and without discrimination. To that end, an absolute prohibition is imposed against violence to life and person, in particular murder, mutilation, torture and the taking of hostages, <Col N="1220" /> with respect to those persons. Passing sentences and carrying out executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court is also strictly prohibited.</P>
    <P>The Geneva Conventions also provide for &ldquo;protective powers&rdquo;, that is, third parties such as other states or the International Committee of the Red Cross, which can offer their services as neutral parties with a view to safeguarding the interests of the parties to the conflict.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan remains of major and immediate concern to the Government. Incidents of extra-judicial killings are being reported daily. Not only do they amount to a serious violation of human rights, but they are creating a dangerous legacy of ethnic violence and hatred which has the potential to imprison Afghanistan in its past. The Government calls on all parties to the conflict in Afghanistan to fully observe and uphold the principles and requirements of international human rights and humanitarian law.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my substantive response on this issue in Priority Question No. 5, which unfortunately we did not have the opportunity of discussing. The substance of that reply is to the effect that the protest along the route to Holy Cross girls' primary school in Ardoyne is now in its twelfth week. During that time, young children and their parents have been subjected to sectarian abuse and worse on their way to and from the school. They have suffered serious intimidation and, on occasion, physically threatening behaviour. They have needed the protection of the police to get safely to school and a number of police officers have been injured in fulfilling their duty. The full extent of hurt being inflicted on these young children, and the harm being done to community relations in North Belfast and elsewhere, by this protest can only be guessed at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the start, the Taoiseach and I have clearly expressed the Government's position in relation to this deeply distressing situation. It is completely unacceptable to direct a protest at children and to intimidate them on their way to school. No grievances or wrongs &ndash; real or perceived &ndash; can justify such disgraceful treatment of young children. I fully appreciate that the residents of Glenbryn have concerns about their security and the need for more facilities for their community, just as the residents of Ardoyne have similar concerns, and those concerns need to be addressed. However, the problems of Glenbryn will not be resolved or alleviated by terrorising <Col N="1221" /> children. The protests cannot be justified and should cease immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach met Fr. Aidan Troy and discussed the Holy Cross dispute with him in some detail. He also had discussions with Tony Blair on the question. I have discussed it at length on a regular basis with the Secretary of State. The Government's consistent position is that we want to be as helpful as possible in a search for a resolution of this problem. It is a very sensitive issue and we have been anxious not to act in a manner which could make a resolution more difficult to achieve or raise tensions further. Achieving an end to the protest as swiftly as possible is our key concern.</P>
      <P>In our efforts to assist in finding a resolution to the problem, we have been in ongoing contact with many of the interested parties in the Holy Cross dispute, including the parents, the board of governors, local elected and community representatives and the British authorities at both political and official levels. In the course of these contacts officials also had discussions with representatives of the loyalist community during which we listened to their concerns and put forward our views on the matter.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Brendan Smith's comments on the issue and I am open to the suggestion to meet the board of governors if its members believe it would be of assistance. I would gladly make myself available for such a meeting. I note the board attended a meeting in Stormont earlier this week when Fr. Troy characterised the outcome of the meeting as providing some cautious hope. We recognise that this is an issue which must be resolved. I call on those engaged in this unjustified action to stop the protest which deprives children of the right to go to school, a basic right in any functioning democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter. We are about to discuss dumping in County Wicklow. There has been bizarre behaviour in the Chamber, with Deputies Perry, Burke, Stanton, Durkan, Coveney <i>et al</i> delaying the progress of the House and, in particular, with regard to the last question, deliberately attempting to prevent the Minister from dealing with a question about young children who are being denied their rights.</P>
      <P>The discovery of a second illegal waste dump in County Wicklow containing hospital waste, bandages, swabs, dirty gloves, tubing from operations and hospital records is a scandal. Clearly, the people responsible are reckless. They have behaved in a way which shows no regard for public health or the laws of the land. It is time a serious example was made of the culprits in this case. The second dump which has just come to light &ndash; there may be further dumps &ndash; is in a sandy area on the banks of the River Slaney about eight miles up-river of the intake for the Carlow and Rathvilly water supply. The people who dumped hospital waste of unknown origin in this area could not care less about the health of the local people.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased Wicklow County Council has indicated its determination to track down the culprits and bring them to justice. The council has been less than active in this regard over the past decade. I have called time and again for strong legal action to be taken against those people who have turned the garden of Ireland into the dumping ground of Dublin. Unfortunately, my calls to date have fallen on deaf ears. The council has been either inactive or ineffective. There has been a failure to prosecute offenders and get court decisions against them. It is time this problem was dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seriousness of these two incidents and the fact that there are up to 200 other illegal dump sites in County Wicklow indicates that major full-scale criminal activity is involved. On behalf of my constituents, I call for the fullest possible criminal investigation into the matter. If neces<Col N="1223" /> sary, the council should be joined by the Environmental Protection Agency or should engage the services of private investigators or other legal services necessary to bring the issue to a head. Illegal dumping is very big business in which a huge amount of money changes hands. The volumes in this case are staggering. I ask that the Criminal Assets Bureau be formally involved in the investigation to examine whether the people involved have been paying their taxes or behaving outside the law.</P>
    <P>In the past, a blind eye has been turned to people involved in illegal dumping. We should all be concerned when our environment is being despoiled by careless, reckless people. Illegal dumping must not only be stamped out, but those guilty of the activity must be brought to justice. Public examples must be made in this case. There must be people in the constituency who are aware of what is happening. I appeal to them to come forward to ensure the culprits are identified. I hope and expect there will be the fullest support for the public authorities. The people of Wicklow are rightly offended at the destruction and damage being done to the environment by a number of reckless, greedy people who have no regard for public health.</P>
    <P>I call for a full criminal investigation involving the county council, the Criminal Assets Bureau and all available assets of the Environmental Protection Agency to ensure the people responsible for this are brought to book at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Roche, I was appalled at the reports in today's media that a further site has been identified in Wicklow where it appears that unauthorised disposal of waste, including waste from hospitals, has taken place. Both this case and that reported last month are under investigation by Wicklow County Council, which is the body with direct functional responsibility for oversight of waste activities and enforcement of relevant legislation. The council has sealed off both sites and has engaged specialists to assist in managing the waste concerned. Garda assistance has been made available to the council and the Environmental Protection Agency is in ongoing contact with the council to provide advice and support, as necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, I am unable to comment on the specifics of this recent case and, in any event, it would be inappropriate to prejudge the outcome of the council's investigations and the actions that may be taken on foot of same. However, the Government's position is clear. Unauthorised dumping of waste is both illegal and grossly irresponsible. Because of its nature, dumping of clinical waste is particularly reprehensible and the full rigours of the law should apply to anyone found guilty of such activity. Severe penalties can be imposed under the Waste Management Act, 1996, in respect of <Col N="1224" /> illegal dumping. A person guilty of such an offence would be liable, upon conviction on indictment, to a fine of up to 10 million and/or up to ten years imprisonment. It should be noted that a landowner who is complicit in unauthorised dumping could also be liable to prosecution in addition to the person who actually carried out such dumping. Furthermore, a landowner could be liable for the costs of removing and properly disposing of the wastes concerned.</P>
    <P>The recent Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations, 2001, will facilitate better control of waste movements and should prove valuable in combating illegal dumping of waste. Under these regulations, all commercial collectors of waste will be obliged to apply to local authorities for a waste collection permit before 30 November. Under the new regulations, local authorities must require permit holders to ensure that the waste collected is transferred to a waste facility that has been licensed by the EPA or holds a permit from the relevant local authority as well as providing for a documentation and tracking system for the movement of all wastes. A local authority would be entitled to refuse to grant a collection permit or to revoke one that had been granted in the event that an applicant or permittee is found guilty of any one of a number of specified waste offences. One of the main concerns of the current investigations will be to determine the nature and source of any clinical waste involved and to ascertain whether there is scope for improved procedures for the handling of such waste. The Department of Health and Children here and its equivalent in Northern Ireland have agreed and implemented a joint approach for the collection, treatment and disposal of clinical health care risk waste throughout the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Clinical waste from publicly funded acute hospitals is managed and disposed of under a contract with a waste management company based in Dublin. This company was contracted to operate a collection and treatment service to the highest environmental and health and safety standards and its facilities are licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency. Health care risk waste should be carefully segregated from other wastes within each hospital while normal, non-hazardous wastes may be disposed of using ordinary waste contractors. The contracted company collects the segregated health care risk waste, sterilises it, carries out an element of materials recovery and recycling and landfills the sterilised residues. Private hospitals can and do avail of this service. There has been no suggestion that this company is implicated in the current incidents. Overall, I am satisfied that the relevant public bodies fully appreciate the seriousness of the cases in question. They will rigorously identify and pursue those responsible and effective action will be taken.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 23 November 2001.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the recent media reports about the extent of homelessness of Irish people in Britain and among the street homeless in London in particular.</P>
      <P>Accurate statistics are not available on the number of Irish who are homeless in Britain. Every six months the Simon Community counts the number of homeless people sleeping rough on the streets of London. The most recent count by the Simon Community was carried out on 3 November. While the nationalities of the street sleepers in inner London were not recorded during this head count the Simon Community, which is in contact with most of the people involved on a daily basis, estimate that more than a quarter of them, about 60, are Irish. For the greater London area, however, the proportion of Irish would not be as high. According to statistics for the year ended 31 March 1999 compiled by the Housing Services Agency, an official body which provides resettlement services for homeless people in London, 11% of people sleeping on the streets of greater London were Irish.</P>
      <P>Many young Irish people who are homeless in Britain have experienced domestic problems at home and leave Ireland without adequate preparation. The Government and voluntary organisations in Ireland are engaged in efforts to assist intending migrants. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs supports voluntary groups, such as Emigrant Advice, which give pre-departure advice and information. FÁS makes available comprehensive information about coping with problems of living and working abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to continue taking whatever further steps it can to address the problem of homelessness among recently arrived Irish immigrants in Britain, especially in London. It provides direct support to a number of voluntary organisations in Britain which advise and assist Irish people there, including groups which care for homeless Irish people. This year the Government made available grants amounting to £2.051 million to these organisations from the Enterprise, Trade and Employment Vote through the Díon Committee, which is based at the Embassy in London. This year's allocation <Col N="1226" /> included an additional £1 million to improve the level of support to the welfare organisations which assist the most vulnerable and socially excluded members of the Irish community.</P>

      <P>In this context, I welcome reports earlier this week that Mr. Rauf Denktash, the leader of the Turkish Cypriots, has agreed to meet Mr. Glafcos Clerides, the President of the Republic of Cyprus, for face-to-face talks in the presence of a UN representative. This meeting is scheduled to take place in early December. This follows intensive efforts by the UN Secretary General's Special Adviser on Cyprus, Mr. Alvaro de Soto, and by the Secretary General himself. Ireland had earlier expressed in the Security Council our disappointment that Mr. Denktash was unable to accept the Secretary General's invitation to attend talks planned for 12 September. I also wish to register the Government's disappointment at the reported comments of the Turkish Foreign Minister to which the Deputy refers. I met Mr. de Soto when I was in New York on 30 October and discussed the situation with him.</P>
      <P>Together with our EU partners, the Government will continue to back unreservedly the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General to resume &ndash; without preconditions in line with Security Council Resolution 1250 &ndash; the search for a comprehensive and lasting settlement in Cyprus in conformity with the relevant Security Council resolutions. Once again, I call on all parties involved to co-operate in the process with a view to achieving a political settlement before the end of the negotiations for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.</P>

      <P>The Government continues to work in all appropriate fora to achieve the objectives of its disarmament policy in relation to weapons of mass destruction, most significantly within the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty process. The Sixth Review Conference of the States Parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty concluded on 19 May 2000 with the adoption of a final document, in which <Col N="1227" /> concrete steps toward the achievement of the elimination of nuclear weapons were agreed. Ireland, together with its partners in the New Agenda Coalition, was to the forefront in the difficult negotiations which made agreement on this final document possible. In particular, the final document included an unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear weapon states to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals in fulfillment of their commitments under Article VI of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>The results of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference subsequently received a major endorsement when a huge majority in the fifty-fifth United Nations General Assembly voted in favour of the so-called New Agenda Resolution. Ireland remains firmly committed to the objectives of the new agenda and the final document of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and is determined to build on the considerable achievements of the 2000 Review Conference. New agenda members and other parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty are focusing attention on the renewed non-proliferation cycle which begins with a Preparatory Committee in New York in April 2002. The next full review of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will take place in 2005. The Non-Proliferation Treaty remains the most successful multilateral disarmament instrument with over 180 States Parties.</P>
      <P>On 8 October this year, the New Agenda Coalition issued a ministerial communiqué which was delivered to the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. This stressed the importance of, <i>inter alia</i>, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in the promotion and maintenance of international stability and as a basis for further reductions of offensive strategic weapons. Related to the question of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is the prospect of the US deployment of a missile defense system since a missile defense program would necessitate at least significant amendments to the Treaty.</P>
      <P>Although the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is a bilateral one, its abrogation could have wide-ranging consequences. It has been the basis for continued reductions of offensive strategic weapons which are crucial if total nuclear disarmament is to be achieved within the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. As I have previously stated in this House I would be very concerned if any missile defense initiative led to the unilateral abandonment of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Our views and concerns on this matter have been and continue to be communicated to the US administration.</P>

      <Quest>the progress which has been made regarding UN Security Council Resolution 1349 in relation to the Western Sahara and Morocco; the progress on Resolution 1359; the progress which has been made on the release of prisoners by both sides; and if international agencies have had access to both sides.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Security Council Resolutions 1349 and 1359 extended the mandate of MINURSO, the UN Mission in Western Sahara, until 30 November 2001. MINURSO is charged with implementing the UN Settlement Plan for the territory of the Western Sahara, agreed in 1991. The settlement plan and subsequent agreements provide for the holding of a free, fair and impartial referendum for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. However, the process for holding the referendum has been blocked due to ongoing disputes between the parties concerning the voter registration process.</P>
      <P>In an effort to overcome these obstacles, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General, Mr. James Baker, has held discussions with the parties, which included the examination of alternative proposals which might also serve as a basis for progress. His proposals were presented to the Security Council as an annex to the Secretary General's last report of 25 April 2001. These take the form of a draft Framework Agreement on the Status of Western Sahara, which would provide for a substantial devolution of authority for the territory of the Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Security Council Resolution 1359, adopted in June 2001, struck a careful balance between continued support for the implementation of the original UN Settlement Plan and encouragement <Col N="1229" /> of the parties to discuss the Framework Agreement put forward by the UN Special Representative. The agreement has been accepted as a basis for negotiation by Morocco but has not been accepted by the POLISARIO or Algeria. Discussions over the last six months between Baker and the parties do not appear to have resolved any of the outstanding issues. In order to permit additional time for further consultations, the Secretary General wrote to the President of the Security Council on 12 November 2001, proposing a technical extension of the mandate of MINURSO for a further period of two months.</P>
    <P>Security Council Resolution 1359 also calls on the parties to abide by their obligations under international humanitarian law to release without further delay all those held prisoner since the start of the conflict. The International Committee of the Red Cross and the relevant UN agencies are actively involved in efforts to alleviate the situation of the prisoners and to obtain their release. Both Morocco and the POLISARIO have been co-operating in allowing access to prisoners. A delegation from the ICRC is currently on a two week mission to visit prisoners in the POLASARIO camps in Tindouf.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a long-standing supporter of the right of the Sahrawi people to self-determination. The Government continue to consider the UN Settlement Plan as a reasonable basis for a just political solution to the conflict in the Western Sahara. We also support the efforts of the Special Representative to seek agreement between the parties. We believe that political negotiations on possible alternative solutions must have the consent of both parties to the conflict.</P>
    <P>During my visit to New York on 10-13 November to attend the General Debate of the UN General Assembly, I had discussions with both the Foreign Minister of Morocco and senior representatives of POLISARIO. I indicated Ireland's support as a member of the Security Council for the ongoing efforts to resolve the conflict by peaceful means. I strongly urged all sides to maintain the cease-fire agreement, to co-operate fully with the UN, and to avoid provocative actions at this critical time. On the issue of prisoners, I reiterated the Government's view that further progress on this issue should not be dependent on the outcome of the wider political negotiations. The compelling humanitarian case for the release of the prisoners has been clearly made. An exchange of prisoners by all sides would be an important confidence building measure in the current efforts to find a lasting political settlement.</P>

      <P>Conflict prevention is one of the main objectives of the EU's external relations policy. Under the EU Programme for the Prevention of Violent Conflicts, which was approved by the Gothenburg European Council in June of this year, the EU gives the highest political priority to improving the effectiveness and coherence of its external activities in the field of conflict prevention. Ireland played a very active role in the discussions leading to the adoption of the EU programme at Gothenburg.</P>
      <P>Under the programme, conflict prevention will be integrated into all relevant aspects of the EU's external relations, including European security and defence policy, development co-operation and trade. The programme emphasizes the need for early warning and monitoring of potential conflict situations. It also addresses the need to make more effective use of EU instruments for long-and short-term prevention, and to develop partnerships with other organisations working in the field of conflict prevention. In elaborating policy in this area, the EU has consulted with the UN and the OSCE, as well as with non-EU countries. The EU programme affirms the primacy of the role of the United Nations for conflict prevention.</P>
      <P>The EU programme provides for the Council to undertake a broad consideration of potential conflict prevention issues at the outset of each Presidency. This review, which complements the yearly orientation debate on the external activities of the EU, allows the Council to give consideration to on-going and emerging crises around the world and enables it to review and discuss instruments for early warning and conflict prevention available to the EU.</P>
      <P>In keeping with this commitment, the General Affairs Council held a debate on conflict prevention in July, at the beginning of the current Belgian Presidency. This debate allowed the Council to give broad consideration to on-going and emerging crises around the world and to discuss priorities for future work. The Council emphasised the need to continue to increase co-operation with relevant international organisations and non-governmental organisations. The Council called on all EU institutions to mainstream conflict prevention within their areas of competence. I contributed to the debate at the Council of Ministers in July, which signalled the EU's commitment to set clear political priorities for its conflict prevention activities. I look forward to revisiting this matter in January when the incoming Spanish Presidency will hold a further debate to complement the annual orientation debate on the EU's external activities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 61 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>The Government fully supports the efforts of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General to set up a transitional administration in Afghanistan as soon as possible. The Government believes that only a fully representative and broad-based government will ensure long-term peace and security in Afghanistan. EU Foreign Ministers also reiterated their support for this approach at their meeting on 19 November.</P>
      <P>The process of putting in place a new administration will need to be undertaken in a secure environment and the various options for restoring long-term security will have to be examined carefully. The UN Secretary General's Special Representative has made it clear that his preferred option is for an all-Afghan force supported, in the interim, by a multinational element. Security Council Resolution 1378, which was adopted in New York on 13 November, endorsed this approach. Resolution 1378 also affirmed that the UN should play a central role in supporting the efforts of the Afghan people to establish a transitional administration leading to the formation of a new government. However, while the UN is currently involved in the process which it is hoped will lead to the formation of such an administration, it is not possible at this stage to say exactly how the UN's role in Afghanistan will develop. The possibility of our taking part in a UN peacekeeping mission in Afghanistan does not, therefore, arise at this stage.</P>
      <P>If asked at some future date to contribute personnel to a UN-mandated mission in Afghanistan, the Government would, as a matter of course, give serious consideration to such a request. Should the Government decide to seek Dáil approval to send the troops on a particular mission, it will take full account of the security situation in the area, the mandate of the mission and other factors such as the equipment and skills necessary for the mission.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 40 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>The Nice European Council in December 2000 agreed there should be a wider and deeper debate about the future of the European Union, to culminate in a further intergovernmental conference in 2004. It was also agreed that the Laeken European Council in December 2001 would agree on how the process would be carried forward in the interim, and that the following questions should, <i>inter alia</i>, be addressed: the delimitation of powers between the Union and the member states; the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights; the simplification of the treaties and the role of national parliaments in the European architecture.</P>
      <P>What the Nice Declaration describes as &ldquo;the need to improve and monitor the democratic legitimacy and transparency of the union and its institutions, in order to bring them closer to the citizens of the member states&rdquo; was also identified as an overarching theme of the process, and I regard it as fundamental to the success of the &ldquo;Future of Europe&rdquo; debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the current Belgian Presidency, Foreign Ministers have had a number of discussions on the &ldquo;Future of Europe&rdquo; process, most recently at the General Affairs Council on Monday. Heads of Government also addressed the matter during the informal European Council at Ghent on 19 October. Final agreement on the Laeken Declaration will of course be for next month's European Council. While no draft text has yet been made available by the Presidency, it is expected that the Laeken Declaration will fall into three parts: a <Col N="1233" /> short analysis of the challenges facing the Union; arrangements for a convention to carry the process forward during 2002-03 and an account of the topics to be addressed by the convention.</P>
    <P>There is broad consensus on the structure and purpose of the convention to be established. It would involve representatives of the member states, national parliaments, the European Parliament and the Commission, together with representatives of the applicant states. The convention would begin work in the first half of 2002 and would meet for about a year. The views of civil society would be sought through a structured network of existing organisations. There would be a substantial gap, or firebreak, between the end of the convention and the start of the Intergovernmental Conference proper, which is likely to take place during our EU Presidency in 2004. The convention would be asked to bring forward options for consideration by the Intergovernmental Conference, which would however retain sole authority for negotiating and agreeing any eventual treaty changes.</P>
    <P>It is likely that the topics which the convention will be invited to discuss will take as their starting point the four items identified at Nice, while perhaps being rather wider in scope and being framed in a more general way. The Government in discussion to date has argued for a focused agenda which helps the European Union to concentrate on the challenge of reducing the disconnection between it and its citizens. Once a formal decision has been taken on the establishment of the convention, the Government will in due course nominate a representative to it. It will be for the Oireachtas to nominate its own representatives once arrangements are finalised.</P>
    <P>In follow-up to the Gothenburg European Council conclusions, the Belgian Presidency has asked all of the member states to submit to it, in advance of Laeken, a short, one-page, account of the current state of national debates on the &ldquo;Future of Europe.&rdquo;  The Government will prepare a short and purely factual account of the establishment and early proceedings of the National Forum on Europe. Obviously, any reports or other documents which the forum may itself eventually prepare would be forwarded to other member states and, once it is established, the convention.</P>

The Deputy will be aware of the efforts we have made, in conjunction with our EU partners and in accordance with the common EU guidelines on the issue of the death penalty, to seek its universal abolition.</P>
      <P>The use of the death penalty in China is of particular concern. A recent EU Heads of Mission report confirmed that China continues to lead the world in the number of executions and the number of offences for which the death penalty can be used. I am particularly concerned by reports that the number of executions has increased this year with the launch of the so-called &ldquo;Strike Hard&rdquo; campaign. This is despite Chinese assurances to the EU that their final goal was the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
      <P>I, along with EU partners, raise human rights issues and in particular our objection to the use of the death penalty, at every appropriate occasion in dialogue with the Chinese. The most effective mechanism for making our concerns known is the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, the last session of which took place on 25-26 October 2001 in Beijing. At that session, the EU reiterated its call for the abolition of capital punishment and expressed its concerns about the increased number of executions. The EU also sought to secure official statistics about the use of the death penalty, which were not forthcoming from the Chinese side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chinese position on this issue is that the <Col N="1235" /> death penalty is permitted under Chinese law and that this is not contrary to international covenants. The Chinese Government also maintains that the death penalty is supported by public opinion in China and that Chinese society is not ready for its abolition. I, along with my EU partners, will continue to pursue this matter with the Chinese authorities.</P>

      <P>Ireland's approach to disarmament has always been consistent with our policy towards developing countries where the question of diversion of resources to arms procurement and the consequences of accumulations of weapons is of particular concern. Ireland has also continued to play a very active role in efforts to achieve total nuclear disarmament. The acquisition and maintenance of a nuclear arsenal is one of the costliest forms of the arms race. Ireland has been similarly active in international efforts to reduce the flow of small arms and light weapons and eliminate the use of land mines.</P>
      <P>With regard to nuclear weapons, Ireland has been consistently to the fore in international efforts towards nuclear disarmament. The forum in which we are most active is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This treaty contains the only legally binding commitment to pursue nuclear disarmament which has been undertaken by the five nuclear weapon states.</P>
      <P>At the Sixth Review Conference of States Parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2000 Ireland was a key participant in the difficult negotiations which led to agreement on the final document of the conference. This final document outlines a significant number of steps to be taken by the nuclear weapons states to achieve the goal of total nuclear disarmament. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty cycle begins again in April next year and together with our new agenda partners we will actively pursue progress on this blueprint for action.</P>
      <P>In July of this year the UN Conference on Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects took place in New York. Ireland played a very active role in this conference and worked with European Union partners to achieve the strongest possible outcome. This conference was the first major step in addressing the problem of small arms proliferation and significantly, represented a formal recognition by the member states of the United Nations of the effects of the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons on civilian populations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> The major issues dealt with by the conference were export criteria and controls, tracing and marking of weapons and regulation of brokers. The programme of action agreed, by consensus, contains politically binding commitments at national, regional and international level. It also establishes a framework for follow-up action including provision for a review conference to be held in 2006.</P>
    <P>Ireland was actively involved in the establishment of the EU code of conduct on arms exports which was adopted by the European Council in 1998. The code lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding on whether to allow an export of military goods. These include Criterion 8 which provides that member states should look at the level of expenditure of the recipient country on arms relative to their social expenditure.</P>
    <P>The issue of arms brokerage is a particularly important one in controlling the spread of small arms and light weapons. Work is continuing in various fora on the issue. It is being discussed in the Wassenaar Arrangement, of which Ireland is a member, and in the European Union working group COARM. Ireland supports efforts to regulate the activities of arms brokers in these fora and will play an active role both within the European Union and elsewhere in trying to achieve progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Ireland also played a key role in the negotiations for the 1997 Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and continues to advocate the need for all states to accede to the convention in order to ensure a world-wide ban on these weapons. Many countries which are parties to the convention and which are afflicted with mines will require international assistance in meeting their obligations under the convention. In recognition of this need Ireland has made ongoing contributions to humanitarian mine action programmes. Since 1994 Ireland has spent more than £7 million on a wide variety of demining and rehabilitation projects as part of its humanitarian assistance projects.</P>

      <P>The Rome Platform, or Platform for a National Contract, is the name given to an initiative launched in Rome in January 1995 by the leading opposition parties and groups in Algeria. The initiative was the result of talks held under the auspices of the Sant' Egidio Community, a public lay association of the Roman Catholic Church, based in Rome and dedicated to fostering dialogue as a means of resolving conflicts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> The platform made an appeal to the parties to the conflict in Algeria for an end to hostilities to allow for the restoration of calm and for the establishment of a transitional government of national unity which would prepare free multi-party elections. The platform also called for the release of political prisoners and for the unbanning of the main opposition party, the FIS. The parties to the platform committed themselves to the renunciation of violence and to full respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law.</P>
    <P>The platform was widely welcomed at the time as a possible means to achieving a peaceful political solution to the conflict in Algeria. However, its proposals were rejected by the then Algerian Government which had not participated in the talks. The Government insisted that any proposal for dialogue should be presented in Algeria and condemned the talks as foreign interference in Algeria's internal affairs. The platform was also rejected by the leading militant opposition group, the GIA, which reaffirmed its commitment to the establishment by armed struggle of a fundamentalist Islamic state.</P>
    <P>In the immediate period following the Rome talks, numerous unsuccessful efforts were made to consolidate and build upon the platform. However, since that period there have been significant developments in Algeria aimed at consolidating democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law. Presidential and parliamentary elections have taken place and there have been important reforms to the Algerian constitution. As a result of these efforts, a number of the main opposition forces involved in the Rome Platform ended their boycott of the political process in Algeria. The current Algerian Government comprises a number of the key parties which participated in the Rome talks.</P>
    <P>Efforts on the part of international community to help Algeria bring an end to the tragic conflict in that country are continuing. These build upon the principles as developed in the dialogue first established by the Sant' Egidio Community. One of the most important of these is the report of the eminent panel appointed by the UN Secretary General. It concluded that efforts to end the conflict in Algeria must take place within the framework of legality, proportionality, and respect for the fundamental human rights of the Algerian people, that the law enforcement, security and self defence forces should be held to the highest standards of accountability so that the Algerian population and the international community at large will feel confident that the rule of law prevails in Algeria, and that it is with more democracy and more respect for human rights that terrorism can be successfully fought.</P>

      <P>It is not clear to which oversight process the Deputy is referring. However, I would point out that all of the elements of the Irish programme of development co-operation are subject to stringent processes of evaluation, monitoring, accountability and oversight. They include, reporting to the Committee of Public Accounts, an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the annual external audit by reputable companies of the accounts of the diplomatic missions managing country programmes, the examination by internal auditors of financial procedures and particular budget lines at home and abroad, a system of advance approval by interdepartmental committee of all budget lines and of all individual programme proposals, and the approval by the same committee at two different levels of three-year strategies for country programmes. In addition, there is an ethos of evaluation in the programme and the evaluation and audit unit carries out a series of evaluations of various aspects of the programme each year.</P>
      <P>Ireland has well-established programmes in Zambia and Uganda which focus on poverty reduction through meeting basic needs. The sectoral concentration of these programmes is on basic health care, including HIV/AIDS, primary education, water and sanitation, basic access roads and good governance. As regards good governance, the programme actively promotes, as a core part of the programme, the building of responsible government and respect for rights.</P>
      <P>I should mention that the Irish programme approach is to develop, in partnership with each government, a three-year strategy, which like the EU's approach on structural funding in Ireland, ties local funding to Irish aid allocations. The Irish programme's funding is, among other things, pledged to the building of schools, the training of teachers, the construction of health centres, the building of labour-based dirt roads, the installation of water and sanitation systems; and the programme's funds are matched by agreed government funds. This gives Ireland Aid a wide level of oversight over the manner in which funding is disbursed.</P>

      <P>The United States, the largest single contributor to the UN budget, has recently agreed to pay a portion of the substantial arrears which it owes to the UN. It has this month paid $582 million towards peacekeeping arrears. The United Nations expects that US payments for the last quarter of this year should total $1.459 billion. This would reduce US arrears to $862 million.</P>
      <P>Total payments to the UN from member states during 2001 are projected to reach $4.716 billion by the end of this year.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, following the successful outcome of the referendum held last June, Ireland will be in a position to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court once the necessary implementing legislation is prepared and enacted into law by the Oireachtas. As I have stated to this House previously, the task of preparing this legislation falls to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and my Department is very willing to provide any assistance it can to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court is a very complex instrument which requires detailed consideration to establish the precise nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be taken. An active part is being taken in discussions at the international level in a number of fora, for example, the Council of Europe and the International Criminal Court Preparatory Committee, <Col N="1240" /> with the aim of ensuring that the necessary domestic measures are taken by states not only in a timely fashion, but also in a comprehensive and consistent manner.</P>
    <P>Ireland, along with its EU partners, has been a consistent supporter of the International Criminal Court. In June of this year the Council of the European Union adopted a common position, the objective of which is to pursue and support an early entry into force of the Rome Statute and the establishment of the court. I remain committed to the speedy ratification by Ireland of the Rome Statute.</P>

      <Quest>the progress the UN Security Council has made in securing the opening of the borders to Afghanistan in order to facilitate the speedy delivery of aid and to secure the safety of refugees.</Quest>
      <QRef>[29248/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has repeatedly called for the early reopening of Afghanistan's borders to refugees, including at the UN Security Council and at the 56th Session of the UN General Assembly. We continue to call on the relevant countries and the international donor community to work together so that we can achieve this as part of our response to the evolving refugee situation. This objective is central to the Government's strong emphasis on the necessity for a visible and effective strategy for meeting the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people over the coming period.</P>
      <P>At UN level, the related issues of refugees and opening borders have been raised directly with both the Pakistani and Iranian Governments by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Ruud Lubbers, during his working visit to their respective capitals. In recent weeks, Afghan refugees in Iran have started to return home. The number choosing to exercise this option has risen to an average of 800 per day and recently peaked at 1,300 people. Overall, it is estimated by the UN that about 12,000 refugees have returned voluntarily to Afghanistan from Iran since 1 November. People who have been displaced within Afghanistan are also gradually returning home. All of these refugees and internally displaced people will need ongoing humanitarian support to survive the winter and to re-establish their livelihoods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should the situation in Afghanistan stabilise further, the UN High Commission for Refugees anticipates that even more people will return to the country. The UNHCR is, therefore, exploring how it may assist those refugees who might similarly wish to return from Pakistan. At the same time, it is improving conditions for existing refugees, including through their relocation to better-serviced camps. One such camp has been established in Kotkai, Pakistan, with space for up to 20,000 people. While the massive refugee move<Col N="1241" /> ments initially anticipated have not happened, there is no room for complacency. I, therefore, reiterate the Government's call on neighbouring countries to reopen their borders so as to allow the relevant agencies deal effectively with the refugee situation.</P>
    <P>Recent improvements in aid delivery have resulted from concerted international action. Ireland has been strongly supportive of a number of special missions which were carried out to countries on Afghanistan's borders and which arose from the consultation process we spearheaded during our presidency of the UN Security Council. In addition to the visit to the region made by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, visits have also been made by the UN Secretary General's two special representatives to Afghanistan and by the UN Under-Secretary General with responsibility for the co-ordination of humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>These special missions have led to improved aid delivery and humanitarian access to Afghanistan through neighbouring countries such as Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgystan. Along with our bilateral efforts on behalf of Irish NGOs, they have also led to an easing of the visa restrictions which had been inhibiting the work of international aid staff. The World Food Programme has delivered over 55,000 tonnes of food aid to Afghanistan since the beginning of October and has total stocks of 88,000 tonnes in the region to support millions of people.</P>
    <P>At EU level, the delivery of humanitarian aid remains an absolute priority and will be subject to closer co-ordination between member states and the Commission, as well as with specialist humanitarian agencies, donor support groups and NGOs. Bilaterally, the £4 million &ndash; 5.08 million &ndash; provided by Ireland in humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan this year is balanced in its delivery between those at risk within the country and those who are seeking protection in neighbouring states such as Pakistan and Iran. This is being provided through Irish NGOs such as Concern, Trócaire, GOAL and Christian Aid, and through the appropriate UN and International Red Cross and Red Crescent agencies who have the necessary working access to deliver aid to those most in need.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 38 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government considers that the human rights situation in Nigeria generally has improved since President Obasanjo came to power in May 1999. However, the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in a number of states in northern Nigeria in the course of the last two years has exacerbated ethnic and religious tensions there.</P>
      <P>With regard to the case of the woman sentenced to death by stoning, the Government has made known its deep concern to the Federal Government through the Nigerian Embassy in Dublin. We have condemned the severe and inhumane nature of the punishment, which is a violation of Article 5 of the International Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Together with our EU partners, we are monitoring developments in the case through our embassies in Abuja. The federal authorities are aware of the EU's concern in relation to this case. The punishment is currently being appealed to the Sokoto state supreme court and a ruling is expected on 27 November. We welcome the decision of the Nigerian Government to appeal against the sentence and we urge it to sustain its efforts to comply with its international human rights obligations.</P>
      <P>We are concerned at the actions of the army in the state of Benue, where violence flared in October. Any indiscriminate use of force by the military must be strongly discouraged by the Nigerian Government.</P>
      <P>Together with our EU partners and other members of the international community, the Government will continue to encourage the elected authorities to strengthen further the protection of human rights in Nigeria, including the rights of women.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the European Council, on 21 September, approved a plan of action to counter terrorism. UN Security Council Resolution 1373 of 28 September is also aimed at combating terrorism.</P>
      <P>In regard to the EU initiatives being undertaken after the events of 11 September, negotiations are taking place in order to finalise many of these initiatives. Ireland is committed to uphold the rights of citizens under the European Convention on Human Rights and also under the Irish Constitution.</P>

      <P>I am aware of Amnesty International's concerns about conscientious objectors in Armenia, particularly in relation to the lack of a legal alternative to military service for conscientious objectors in that country. The urgent need to remedy this situation has been made clear to the Armenian government in the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. At the annual EU &ndash; Armenia Co-operation Council held in Luxembourg on 30 October, the EU side raised this specific issue with Armenia. Armenia stated that it &ldquo;shall act vigorously to meet its Council of Europe commitments.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All recent reports of cases of imprisoned con<Col N="1244" /> scientious objectors in Armenia have involved Jehovah's Witnesses. Upon its accession to the Council of Europe in January this year, Armenia undertook to ensure that all persons, including those belonging to religious groups which might be regarded as &ldquo;non-traditional&rdquo;, would be allowed to practise their religions without discrimination. Armenia also agreed to provide an alternative to military service within three years of its accession. My latest information is that the conscientious objectors have yet to be released.</P>
    <P>I urge the Armenian Government to abide by the undertakings it made upon accession to the Council of Europe and to release those prisoners detained because of their conscientious objection to military service.</P>

      <P>I responded to the House on 9 May 2001 on the progress made by the interdepartmental committee, IDC, on developments regarding the Battle of the Boyne site. Since that date, the IDC has received and accepted, with some minor amendments, the report of the professional consultants. The consultants' report covered the following areas: physical-spatial planning; infrastructure and facilities; access and circulation; site presentation; historic landscape protection; and signage and management issues.</P>
      <P>In order to progress the consultant's report, a sub-committee of the IDC was formed to draw up general plans and costings for how the site might be developed in order that the IDC could make recommendations to Government. The sub-committee has met on two occasions. Following these meetings, the Office of Public Works is arranging for a building contractor to make Oldbridge House and out-buildings secure and safe. This work is necessary to facilitate the preparation of specialist reports on their condition. When the sub-committee has received these reports they will prepare detailed plans, together with costings, for consideration by the IDC. Until the IDC has prepared and presented its recommendations to Government, I will not be in a position to be precise about the likely timeframe for the development of the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other action taken since May of this year includes: provision of a temporary car-park and viewing points; the opening of the site to visitors during the August bank holiday weekend and for heritage week in September; the appointment of a consultant by Dúchas to prepare an interpretative plan; preparatory work is being undertaken <Col N="1245" /> by Meath County Council in respect of road access to the site; and consultations with interested parties, including groups in the North, which are ongoing. Plans are also in hand to open more of the grounds to the public from next June.</P>

      <P>Since the beginning of the year, 298 punishment attacks have been recorded; 191 have been attributed to loyalist paramilitaries and 107 have been attributed to republican paramilitaries.

      <P>The Government welcomes the resumed dialogue between the Spanish and UK Governments on the future of Gibraltar under the Brussels Process. The Brussels Process was inaugurated in 1984 by the then respective Foreign Ministers, Fernando Morán and Geoffrey Howe. Under its terms, talks were aimed at overcoming differences between the UK and Spain over Gibraltar and at promoting co-operation on economic, cultural and aviation matters. It was established that issues of sovereignty would also be discussed under the process.</P>
      <P>Talks had been suspended for four years. The British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, and his Spanish counterpart, Senor Pique, met on 26 July 2001 to relaunch the process. It was decided on that date that a further ministerial meeting would be held in Barcelona on 20 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following this meeting on Tuesday, a joint press communiqué was issued under which both Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to continuing discussions on the future of Gibraltar. They stated that they hoped to conclude a <Col N="1246" /> comprehensive agreement by summer 2002, and that any such agreement would cover all outstanding issues, including those of co-operation and sovereignty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have indicated to the House on a number of recent occasions the concerns of the Government in relation to the human rights situation in Turkish prisons. The rising number of deaths both inside and outside the prisons as a result of the hunger strike gives cause for grave concern.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of worrying incidents recently. On 5 November the Turkish security services entered the Kucukarmutlu area of Istanbul with armoured vehicles and bulldozers, resulting in the deaths, in circumstances which are unclear, of four persons who were reportedly on hunger strike in sympathy with hunger strikers in the prisons. In addition, there were reports of a further raid in the Alibeyköy area of Istanbul on 14 November in which nine people were detained by Turkish riot police.  The Turkish authorities have informed the EU that the action taken in Kucukarmutlu was in response to persons blocking roads and preventing local inhabitants from going about their business. They maintain that the four people who died were injured in exchanges with security forces and died in hospital of their wounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the work of the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture, CPT, which is continuing to work with the Turkish Government and with the prisoners in an attempt to resolve the crisis. In this respect, I wel<Col N="1247" /> come the fact that a number of prison reforms have now been introduced, including measures to enhance prisoner contacts with the outside world and to establish prison monitoring boards and sentence enforcement judges. I also welcome the publication on 8 November of the report on the CPT's <i>ad hoc</i> visit to Turkey in July 2000 as well as the decision by the Turkish authorities to authorise the publication of all reports on visits by the CPT to Turkey which have not yet been placed in the public domain. The publication of this material will provide a full picture of the evolution and impact of the CPT's work in Turkey over the last 12 years.</P>
    <P>As I have already noted in the House, I endorse the view of the CPT that a resolution of the crisis in the prisons will require a process of adaptation, explanation and confidence-building and that this will involve, <i>inter alia</i>, the examination of all complaints of ill-treatment against prisoners at the time the Turkish authorities intervened in the prisons in December last and, where appropriate, the prosecution of state officials. Finally, I urge all the parties involved to exercise restraint and to make every effort to ensure that further loss of life, both inside and outside the prisons, can be avoided.</P>

All Government Departments can avail of this service. This material would include, for instance, official correspondence, official documents and publications, information materials and stationery items.</P>
      <P>For most destinations the usual method of transmission is via the An Post express mail service, EMS. Whenever bulky items &ndash; for example, information materials &ndash; have to be sent, air freight is used as there is a weight limit on the express mail service.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 48, 77, 84 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the house on 16 October, Ireland is a strong supporter of the current enlargement process for strategic reasons of peace and for economic reasons. It is the most important and exciting development for the European Union in the years immediately ahead. We look forward to welcoming the new member states into the European Union.</P>
      <P>Enlargement will provide important economic opportunities for new and existing member states alike. Ireland stands to gain much from a greatly expanded marketplace with over 100 million new customers. Assured and free access to that new market will bring significant opportunities for this country. An enlarged EU can play an even more important and credible role in world affairs. Enlargement will also help to provide the opportunity to address outstanding issues on our continent, including organised crime and a better functioning relationship with Russia and the states of the former Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>The tempo of the accession negotiations increased during the first half of this year and this momentum has continued during the Belgian Presidency. We have now reached a point where substantive and, at times, difficult issues are being addressed and real progress achieved. Negotiations are continuing in line with the Commission's road map strategy and the majority of candidate countries are proceeding well in their preparations for membership. This assessment is endorsed by the Commission in its strategy paper for the enlargement process, published on 13 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission paper confirms that it should be possible to complete negotiations by the end of 2002 for ten of the 12 applicant countries. The objective set by the European Council in June 2001 at Gothenburg, that they should be able to <Col N="1249" /> participate in the European Parliament elections of 2004 as members, is on course. Ireland fully supports this objective.</P>
    <P>An important conclusion of the Commission strategy paper is that the financial perspectives agreed in Berlin in 1999, which provide the financial framework for the initial stages of enlargement, are adequate to accommodate the accession of up to ten new member states. Ireland welcomes this clear statement.</P>
    <P>Among its enlargement-related initiatives, Ireland is participating in a number of multilateral schemes designed to help the applicant states in their efforts to adopt the <i>acquis communautaire</i>. The Government has also increased substantially the moneys available for the training of public servants and officials from the applicant countries at the Institute of Public Administration and University College Dublin. We have opened embassies in several of the applicant countries in recent years and hope to continue to open further embassies over the coming years. Finally, the President, Taoiseach and several Government Ministers, including myself, have been visiting many of the candidate countries.</P>
    <P>With regard to assurances given to candidate countries, Ireland strongly supports the principle of differentiation in the accession process. This means that each candidate country should advance toward accession on the basis of its success in negotiations and preparations for membership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 53 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>On 9 November, the UN Security Council met with the political committee of the Lusaka ceasefire agreement to examine how the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC, can be further progressed. The political committee includes representatives of the Governments of the DRC, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, Uganda, Rwanda, Zambia and three rebel groups in the DRC. Burundi was also represented. Following the meeting, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1376 of 2001, which builds on previous Security Council resolutions and charts a way forward for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Congo, and for the disarmament, demobilisation, repatriation, resettlement or reintegration of the negative forces operating in eastern Congo.</P>
      <P>The resolution acknowledges the progress made so far in implementing the Lusaka agreement, including the fact that the ceasefire is generally holding, despite some infringements, and the fact that some foreign forces have withdrawn from the DRC, including all Namibian troops. The resolution states the Council's support for the launching of phase III of the deployment of MONUC, the UN mission in the DRC. MONUC's task during phase III will be to assist in the voluntary disarmament of negative forces, including perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide and Burundian rebels, and in the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Congo. To this end the active co-operation of all parties will be required and the resolution sets out the steps necessary, including the establishment of a direct, confidence-building dialogue between the Governments of the DRC and Rwanda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resolution also expresses the Council's support for the inter-Congolese dialogue and for the facilitator of the dialogue, former Botswanan President Masire. This dialogue is intended to <Col N="1251" /> lead to representative governance and democratic elections in the DRC. As a concrete demonstration of our support for the dialogue, Ireland earlier this year contributed £100,000 to the office of the facilitator.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian and human rights situation in the DRC remains a cause of particular concern to Ireland and other Security Council members, and we have consistently called on the parties to refrain from human rights violations and to respect the provisions of international humanitarian law. This year Ireland has contributed £750,000 in humanitarian aid to the DRC.</P>
    <P>The recently published addendum to the panel of experts report on the exploitation of the natural resources and other forms of wealth of the DRC provides evidence of the ongoing exploitation by all sides in the conflict of the DRC's human and natural resources to finance their war efforts. While the exploitation of the DRC's resources did not cause the war, the mining of minerals such as coltan, gold, copper, cobalt and diamonds by both states and rebel groups has contributed to its continuation. The addendum will be discussed by the UN Security Council in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The Government continues to strongly support the implementation of the Lusaka ceasefire agreement which provides a framework for a negotiated settlement which is fair to all parties, which respects the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of the DRC, which upholds democratic principles and human rights, and which takes account of the security interests of the DRC and all other countries of the region. Within that framework, Ireland has laid particular emphasis on the holding of the inter-Congolese dialogue and on the need to address human rights abuses and the humanitarian suffering of the people of the DRC, particularly refugees and internally displaced people. We have also called on all foreign forces to withdraw from the DRC in accordance with Security Council resolutions, while recognising the need for the security concerns of neighbouring states to be addressed. Ireland played an active role in the drafting of the three Security Council resolutions on the situation in the DRC adopted since we took our seat in January, and we have sought to ensure that the DRC remains high on the Council's list of priorities.</P>
    <P>While not underestimating the challenges that lie ahead, the Government is confident that with the support of the international community and the full co-operation of all parties involved in the conflict in the DRC with the MONUC mission, peace can finally be achieved in the DRC and the wider Great Lakes region.</P>

      <P>On 12 October last, when the Secretary of State specified the UDA, UFF and LVF and declared that their ceasefires were over, Dr. Reid stated that one of the reasons for the inclusion of the LVF in his announcement was that he was in possession of clear information indicating the involvement of the LVF in the despicable murder of Martin O'Hagan. We have been assured that the security forces will do all within their power to bring the perpetrators of this dreadful act to justice. We have asked to be kept fully informed of developments in the investigation into this murder.</P>

      <P>The European Council meeting in Helsinki in December 1999 accorded Turkey candidate status in relation to EU accession. However, the strengthening of Turkey's links with the EU and its eventual accession depend on Turkey's pursuit of the political and economic reforms on which it has embarked, including the alignment of human rights standards and practices with those in force in the EU and respect for and protection of minorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress toward fulfilling these criteria is kept under constant review. The Helsinki European Council provided that the EU-Turkey enhanced political dialogue would emphasise progress toward fulfilling the political criteria for Turkey's accession with particular reference to the issue of human rights. The EU Commission monitors the human rights situation in Turkey and in its 2001 Regular Report on Turkey's Progress Towards Accession, published on 13 November, it noted that the recent constitutional amendments are a significant step toward strengthening guarantees in the field of human rights and fundamental freedoms and limiting capital punishment. However, the report also noted that a number of restrictions on the exercise of fundamental freedoms have remained. The report noted that in the field of cultural rights, while constitutional changes are to be welcomed, the actual situation has not <Col N="1253" /> improved notably in relation to broadcasting and education.</P>
    <P>While the daily private use of Kurdish language and Kurdish cultural expression are not prohibited by law, nonetheless those who speak that language or promote or engage in Kurdish cultural activities may in certain circumstances find themselves susceptible to legal sanction. Broadcasting and publishing in Kurdish continue to be banned although there is an expectation that these bans will be lifted in line with the recent constitutional amendments. The situation of the Kurds in Turkey has not arisen at the UN Security Council.</P>

      <P>Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations charges the Security Council with the maintenance and restoration of international peace and security. Under international law, UN member states have the inherent right to individual or collective self-defence, recognised under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Resolution 1368 recognised this right in accordance with the charter and identified the terrorist attacks perpetrated on 11 September as a threat to international peace and security.</P>
      <P>The United States led military action in Afghanistan began on 7 October last. At Ireland's initiative, the Security Council met on 8 October to discuss the action taken by the US and the UK in Afghanistan. The Security Council was briefed by the US and UK on their actions. Council members agreed that the military action taken in Afghanistan is being taken in self-defence. Ireland's position has been steadfast and clear on the war against terrorism; we stand with the US and other UN member states in the global coalition against terrorism. The Government unequivocally supports the action being taken against terrorism within the framework defined by the UN and international law.</P>

      <P>This year's State of the World Population Report, published earlier this month by the UNFPA, United Nations Population Fund, focuses on the broad challenges for development as a result of changes in the size, rate of growth and distribution of human population. The report provides, in addition, a dramatic profile of how soaring population growth can affect the world's environment and its capacity for social and economic development. Pressure on land, forests, atmosphere and water is severe and will increase in line with projected population increases which, at current estimates, could reach over nine billion people by 2050.</P>
      <P>The global population, which has now exceeded six billion, is putting immense pressure on developing countries, particularly in the urban areas of the poorest countries. In this context, Ireland Aid sees the concept of sustainable development as a critical framework for all of our development co-operation work and has put in place systematic procedures for assessing the environmental as well as the social and economic dimensions of aid programmes. Ireland Aid is also increasingly focusing attention on the provision of basic education and health care which we believe is the key to a stable world population. We have sharply increased our support for the work of the UNFPA in recent years and, as part of our multi-annual budgetary planning, we have given indicative commitments for the next two years which will effectively result in a doubling of our current level of funding to £2 million by 2003. The rate of increase in Irish support for the fund is now the highest among donor countries.</P>
      <P>The UNFPA report makes a valuable contribution to the preparations for the ten year review of progress since the Rio Earth Summit which will take place in South Africa in September 2002. It reminds us of the scale and the immensity of the global challenges that have to be tackled if we are to promote development that is sustainable and balances and integrates economic, social and environmental concerns. The Department of Foreign Affairs, together with the Department of the Environment and Local Government and other relevant Departments, is participating in the preparations, both national and international, for the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg next year.</P>

      <P>On 12 October, the Secretary of State announced his decision to specify the UDA, UFF and LVF and declare their ceasefires over. This decision was <Col N="1255" /> made in light of the involvement of those organisations in a large number of violent incidents over a sustained period of time in many parts of Northern Ireland. In the period leading up to this decision, Dr. Reid and I discussed the question on a number of occasions. I said at the time that I very much regretted that the actions of the loyalist paramilitaries involved had compelled the Secretary of State to reach that decision. He did so only with the greatest reluctance and on the basis of a detailed assessment of the status of these organisations' ceasefires provided by the Chief Constable.</P>
      <P>Since that announcement, and despite positive developments in the wider political process, loyalist paramilitaries have continued to attack vulnerable Catholic communities. I utterly condemn this continuing violence and I once again call on all those with influence within these organisations to work for an immediate and complete end to all violent activity.</P>

In addition, under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government gave a commitment to work for the early establishment of this forum.

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government strongly supports reform of the United Nations and I took every opportunity to reiterate this during my recent visits to the UN. In particular, we fully support the UN Secretary General in his efforts to ensure the UN's continued capacity to contribute effectively to conflict prevention and to social and economic development. Ireland and its EU partners are actively engaged in the reform agenda and have sought to stress that the reform process is not simply a cost cutting exercise, but one which is aimed at strengthening and renewing the UN system.</P>
      <P>The Millennium Summit, which took place in September 2000, provided fresh impetus to the reform process. The Government is acutely conscious of the need to strengthen the United Nations in order to fulfil the commitment made in the Summit Declaration to ensure a more effective instrument for pursuing the fight for peace and development and against poverty, ignorance and disease.</P>
      <P>The financial problems which the UN faced over the past decade caused difficulties in advancing UN reform and the Government has consistently called on all member states to work to resolve this situation by paying their contributions and arrears. There have been recent significant developments in relation to financing which should add impetus to the reform process. The United States, the largest single contributor to the UN budget, has moved to pay a substantial portion of its arrears to the organisation. It is expected that US payments for the last quarter of 2001 will total $1.459 billion and this should ease considerably the pressure on the UN's finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most difficult issues facing the UN membership generally is the question of Security Council reform. The General Assembly decided in 1993 to establish a working group, open to all UN member states, to consider all aspects of the question of an increase in the membership of the Security Council and other matters related to the Council. The working group has been meeting regularly in New York since 1993, with Ireland as an active participant, but progress has been disappointing. The issues involved are enlargement of Security Council membership, the Council's working methods and its decision-making procedures, including, crucially, the use of the veto. Ireland supports a small, regionally balanced increase in both permanent and non-permanent seats to create an enlarged Council of between 20 and 25 members. We strongly believe that any agreement on enlargement should not diminish the possibility for smaller UN member states to serve on the Council as non-permanent members. <Col N="1257" /> A significant number of other member states opposes the creation of new permanent seats on the Council and this has created difficulties for the working group. Ireland will continue to play an active and constructive role in seeking agreement on this issue.</P>
    <P>On Security Council working methods, there appears to be fairly wide consensus that these should be more formalised and transparent, involving greater consultation by the Council with other UN organs, including the General Assembly and Secretary General, and, in peacekeeping matters, with troop contributing countries. As a member of the Security Council, Ireland has taken an open and transparent approach to the work of the Council, consulting widely with interested countries outside the Security Council, including in the area of peacekeeping. I am pleased that we have been able to live up to our campaign pledge to adopt a consultative approach to our membership of the Council.</P>
    <P>Ireland would like to see the veto eliminated altogether but, recognising the strong opposition of the permanent members, has proposed that they be invited to accept a limitation of the veto and to exercise it only when they consider the question of vital national importance, taking into account the interests of the United Nations as a whole. At the same time any new permanent members of the Council would declare that they would never exercise the veto.</P>
    <P>One positive development at the Security Council which is of particular resonance for Ireland is the progress that has been made this year in strengthening co-operation between the Security Council and countries contributing troops to UN peacekeeping operations. As a permanent troop contributor, we welcome the increased recognition of the vital input which countries contributing troops make to SECCO decision-making. During our October Presidency of the Council, Ireland chaired three such meetings with countries contributing troops to UN missions on the Iraq-Kuwait border, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and East Timor.</P>
    <P>Major reforms are under way in UN peacekeeping. The report of the Panel on UN Peace Operations, the Brahimi Report, recommended wide-ranging institutional, operational, staffing and funding changes to UN peacekeeping operations and important progress has been made in implementing its recommendations. The allocation of adequate resources for operations and for the secretariat is a key issue which is currently under negotiation in the budgetary committee of the General Assembly and Ireland is participating actively in these discussions. Progress has also been made on administrative reform in the development area. A UN development group has been established which brings together the heads of all of the development agencies for discussions on co-ordination and coherence. A UN Development Assistance Framework, UNDAF, is in place <Col N="1258" /> under which UN agencies in the field are based in a common UN house and are co-ordinated by the resident representative of the UNDP. Co-ordination of the UN's emergency humanitarian operations has been centralised in the new office of the Co-ordinator for Humanitarian Assistance, OCHA.</P>
    <P>Far reaching reforms have also been implemented in many of the UN's funds and programmes. The UN Development Programme, UNDP, has introduced major management restructuring and is streamlining its operations, decentralising and focusing its work programme. Similarly the UN Children's' Fund, UNICEF, the Population Fund, UNFPA, and the World Health Organisation, WHO, have also implemented reform programmes. All these agencies are now receiving increased donor support, including from Ireland, and are working to strengthen their links with the private sector and private philanthropic foundations. Ireland has sharply increased its funding to UNDP, £4.85 million in 2001, and UNICEF, £3 million in 2001, and entered into indicative multi-annual funding commitments with these bodies. Ireland will become a member of the executive board of UNICEF for the first time for a two year period on 1 January 2002. We will use our board membership to support continuing reform, particularly the need for improved co-ordination with other UN bodies.</P>
    <P>It is apparent that significant progress has been made in the UN reform process but that more work remains to be done. I assure the House that Ireland will continue to actively engage in all aspects of the reform agenda.</P>

      <P>On 12 November, the British Government introduced the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill which is currently being considered in the House of Commons. The Bill, which passed its Second Reading on 20 November by 458 votes to 5, is at present in committee and it is expected that proceedings in the House of Commons will conclude next Monday, 26 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains a wide range of measures which the British Government considers to be necessary in the light of the situation arising fol<Col N="1259" /> lowing the 11 September terrorist attacks. The following are among the measures contained in the Bill: expanded powers to seize terrorist cash; powers to freeze the assets of overseas residents or governments where there is a threat against the UK economy, UK nationals or persons resident in the UK; additional powers for the police to search, examine and fingerprint terrorist suspects in order to identify them; additional powers of detention under the Immigration Act; measures to address religious and racial hatred or violence; measures to ensure the security of the nuclear and aviation industries and to improve the security of dangerous substances that may be targeted or used by terrorists.</P>
    <P>My officials have examined this lengthy and complex instrument in the short time available since its publication and will continue to monitor its progress through the British Parliament.</P>
    <P>A significant part of the concern expressed by civil liberties groups and others has been directed at the additional detention powers which the Bill will give the Home Secretary, in certain cases. At present, persons who are awaiting deportation under the Immigration Act, 1971, may be detained, but only if deportation will be possible within a reasonable period of time. The new legislation will allow the detention of persons awaiting deportation provided certain specific conditions are met. I am satisfied that, as the legislation is currently drafted, these conditions are such that the new detention powers will not affect Irish persons living in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The legislation will extend to Northern Ireland the power which already exists in Britain for a senior police officer to authorise pedestrians and vehicles to be stopped and searched for offensive weapons where the officer reasonably believes incidents involving serious violence may take place in a locality.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a number of the other measures will affect all persons living in the United Kingdom. I am satisfied, however, that none of the measures will have a greater effect on Irish persons living in the UK than on British nationals or other UK residents.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> In our ongoing contacts with the authorities of Saudi Arabia, Ireland and EU partners have urged greater progress in ensuring respect for civil and political rights.

Violations of the right to a fair trial, arbitrary arrests and detentions and the lack of transparency in the legal system and restricted access to detainees are areas of deep concern.</P>
    <P>On the question of prisoners of conscience, Ireland together with our EU partners has taken the approach of encouraging Saudi Arabia to co-operate fully with the UN human rights mechanisms. We have strongly urged Saudi Arabia to become a party to and implement the two most important conventions in the field of human rights &ndash; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The ICCPR recognises that everyone has the right to liberty and security of person and that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention or be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.</P>

      <P>Under Article 38 of the EU Council Regulation 1260/1999 (the General Structural Funds Regulation), organisations in receipt of EU funds are required to retain all relevant documentation for a period of three years following receipt of final payment from the Commission. This is required to facili<Col N="1262" /> tate any audits or control visits which are deemed necessary by the managing authority for the ESF community initiatives, the ESF financial control unit or the European Commission within that period.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is not possible at this stage to state definitively that no further audits will be necessary in respect of the EMPLOYMENT community initiative, Youthstart, project or any other project in receipt of ESF funding over the same period.</P>
      <P>An audit of the Youthstart project was commissioned by my Department in October 2000. As a result of that audit, certain issues arose which required clarification and are the subject of ongoing discussions between my Department and the resource centre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 (No. 7 of 1989) and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations, 1993 (S.I. No. 44 of 1993), impose duties on employers and employees to ensure that the health and safety of workers, who may be affected by a work activity, are protected. The removal of asbestos, or materials containing asbestos, comes within the scope of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations, 2001 (S.I. No. 188 of 2001).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, comprehensive European Union-derived legislation exists for the protection of workers at work under the European Communities (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations, 1989, as amended in 1993 and 2000 (S.I. No. 34 of 1989, S.I. No. 276 of 1993 and S.I. No. 74 of 2000 respectively). The regulations apply to all work which exposes persons to risks arising from the inhalation of asbestos fibres. The aim of the regulations is to protect the health of employees by reducing the level of exposure to asbestos fibres in the workplace, by setting lower exposure limits for asbestos fibre concentration in air, by establishing methods for sampling and measuring asbestos fibres in air and by banning the use of low density asbestos materials. The regulations require that adequate information, instruction and training must be provided to workers with respect to the potential risk to their health should they become exposed to asbestos fibres and they outline the precautions to be taken to provide such protection. The European Communities (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) (Amendment) Regulations, 2000 are designed to implement certain <Col N="1263" /> elements of Council Directive 87/217/EEC relating to the prevention of significant environmental pollution due to the release of asbestos fibres or dust, arising from the demolition of buildings, structures and installations containing asbestos and the removal therefrom of asbestos or materials containing asbestos.</P>
    <P>To reflect the change in emphasis from manufacture and application of asbestos-containing materials to protecting those working in buildings with asbestos-containing materials, or during the removal of such materials, the EU is currently drafting a proposal to amend the current Community asbestos worker protection legislation. The proposed directive will provide for specific requirements to ensure the protection of high-risk workers against asbestos fibres exposure. In addition, this directive will further reduce the existing exposure limits so as to enhance the protection of workers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the incidence of the brown coloured slick, in the upper Sruwaddacon Bay in County Mayo, was brought to the attention of the Malin Head coast guard which reported the matter to the Department's marine rescue co-ordinating centre. The MRCC in turn contacted Mayo County Council who carried out an investigation at the time and reported that there was no indication that it was harmful.</P>
      <P>My Department is advised that the Environmental Protection Agency carried out analysis of a number of samples which it received from a local radio station. The samples were more than 35 hours old which is the cut off point for the EPA to stand over its analysis. The analysis indicated substantial oxidisable material present in the samples which would indicate the presence of organic matter but it was not possible to identify whether it emanated from land or sea. Details of the results may be obtained by contacting the EPA in Castlebar. There have been no reports of any further problems in the area.</P>
      <P>No action is necessary is relation to measures taken to clean up the brown slick as it has been broken by the sea action and dissipated. There have been no further reports of any problems in the area.</P>

      <P>Funding has been provided in my Department's Vote since 2000 to encourage the development of pilot schemes at catchment level to give an incentive to the reduction of the commercial salmon fishing effort. It is stated policy that the context for any such schemes will be strictly catchment based, voluntary and locally driven and based on matching funding from all players at realistic levels. The regional fisheries boards have been asked to lead and encourage pilot schemes. Take up has been disappointing but this reflects the complexities and difficulties involved in brokering consensus at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2000, one pilot scheme for voluntary set-aside of salmon fishing engines was agreed. The scheme involves the set-aside of draft nets and a <Col N="1265" /> fixed fishing engine on the Munster Blackwater. The pilot scheme is intended to operate for a period of five years, that is, 2000 to 2004. The proposal has been developed in consultations involving my Department, the Blackwater salmon development group, the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute. The Southern Regional Fisheries Board administers the scheme on behalf of the Department.</P>
    <P>This pilot scheme does not encompass the drift net licence holders. A separate set-aside proposal for drift nets has been developed by the Southern Regional Fisheries Board working with the Blackwater Salmon Development Group. I met the group recently to discuss their proposals and emphasised the need to ensure value for money in finalising the scheme. Discussions are continuing on these proposals. In addition all the regional boards are being urged to proactively encourage the development of sustainable cost effective proposals at catchment level.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 2000, the Joint United Nations programme on HIV-AIDS, UNAIDS, secretariat and the World Health Organisation, WHO, reported that 36.1 million men, women and children around the world were living with the HIV virus or had developed full blown AIDS. In 2000 alone, over 5 million people were infected and over 3 million died of this disease.</P>
      <P>The spread of HIV has led to a global epidemic which is far more extensive than was ever predicted. Though AIDS is now found everywhere in the world, and the incidence of the disease is growing rapidly in the Caribbean, in Asia and in Eastern Europe, by far the worst affected region is the African continent.</P>
      <P>UNAIDS estimates that 25 million people, or over 70% of the global total of people infected with HIV, are living in Africa. The percentage of the adult population living with HIV is estimated to be 36% in Botswana and 26% in Zimbabwe. In these situations, a child who is now 15 years old has a 50% risk of dying of AIDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> A tragic aspect of the epidemic is the growing population of orphaned children &ndash; of the world's 13.2 million children orphaned by AIDS, 12.1 are living in Africa. The disease also particularly affects women, directly by their increased susceptibility to infection and indirectly in their role as principal carers. In addition, many grandparents have to assume the role of absent and deceased parents.</P>
    <P>There is a clear link between HIV-AIDS, poverty and under-development. HIV-AIDS is both symptom and cause of poverty. Poor people are more likely to be infected with HIV. Once infected, the poor and the malnourished, whose immune systems are already weak, will succumb more easily. AIDS attacks fragile societies also, undermining their capacity to mount an effective response.</P>
    <P>In confronting this disease, prevention has to be the mainstay of control. Many programmes that have been targeted at prevention, particularly to high-risk groups, have been demonstrated to be effective. Many innovative support programmes, which promote low cost approaches to the care of those living with AIDS and to the dependants of families affected by the disease, have been developed at community level. However, to sustain programmes directed at prevention and support there is a need for an enhanced international response to this global epidemic.</P>
    <P>In an overview report in preparation for the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV-AIDS earlier this year, the UN Secretary General outlined three critical factors which he believes are essential for the control of this disease. The first factor is leadership &ndash; at global, country and community level &ndash; which the Secretary General has indicated is the single most important factor in reversing the epidemic. The second is the need for improved co-ordination &ndash; of resources, of planning across government departments, between public and private sectors &ndash; which is critical to an efficient and effective response. The third factor is the need for more resources &ndash; at present, the resources committed to the fight against HIV-AIDS are only a small fraction of what is needed to mount a satisfactory response.</P>
    <P>HIV-AIDS is a major public health and development challenge in all countries in Africa where the Irish Government is providing financial support for development programmes, that is, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Lesotho, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe. The extent of the problem and the way this disease is undermining development progress, particularly in countries benefiting from Ireland Aid support, requires a response that is urgent, resourced, focused and sustained.</P>
    <P>The need to support HIV-AIDS interventions has been well recognised by Ireland Aid. In January 2000, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Don<Col N="1268" /> nell, launched a new HIV-AIDS strategy for the Ireland Aid programme.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has on many occasions signalled his personal commitment to addressing the HIV-AIDS epidemic. Last June he demonstrated the extent of that commitment by leading the Irish Government delegation to the UN Special Session on HIV-AIDS in New York. In the course of his address to the General Assembly he committed the Irish Government to spending an additional US$30 million on HIV-AIDS programmes in developing countries from 2002.</P>
    <P>The strength of this political commitment, along with the availability of additional resources and the publication of a clear strategic plan for HIV-AIDS, will allow Ireland Aid to continue to respond in a substantive and coherent manner to what is one of the greatest development challenges of our time.</P>

We continue to call on the relevant countries and the international donor community to work together so that we can achieve this key objective. In his contacts with President Bush, the Taoiseach has highlighted the humanitarian dimension of the crisis. I have also been pursuing these concerns, including in my meetings with other Foreign Ministers and with senior UN representatives at both the UN Security Council and the 56th Session of the UN General Assembly. In these latest contacts, we are emphasising that there must be a visible and effective strategy for meeting the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people over the coming period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, we are also witnessing continued human rights abuses in Afghanistan and the Government condemns these actions unreservedly. We call on all parties to the conflict in Afghanistan to fully observe and uphold the principles and requirements of international human rights and humanitarian law. Such human rights abuses must stop both to ensure that we can continue to provide essential humanitarian aid to the vulnerable population and to create the necessary conditions for lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan. The Government considers the observ<Col N="1270" /> ance of human rights to be fundamental to any future political dispensation in that country.</P>
    <P>Recent improvements in aid delivery have resulted from concerted international action. Ireland has been strongly supportive of a number of special missions which were carried out to countries on Afghanistan's borders and which arose from the consultation process which we spearheaded during our Presidency of the UN Security Council. In addition to the visit to the region made by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, visits have also been made by the UN Secretary General's two Special Representatives to Afghanistan and by the UN Under-Secretary General with responsibility for the co-ordination of humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>These special missions have led to improved aid delivery and humanitarian access to Afghanistan through neighbouring countries such as Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgystan. Along with our bilateral efforts on behalf of Irish NGOs, they have also led to an easing of the visa restrictions which had been inhibiting the work of international aid staff. The World Food Programme has delivered over 55,000 tonnes of food aid to Afghanistan since the beginning of October and has total stocks of 88,000 tonnes in the region to support millions of people. At EU level, the delivery of humanitarian aid remains an absolute priority and will be subject to closer co-ordination between member states and the Commission, as well as with specialist humanitarian agencies, donor support groups and NGOs. Bilaterally, the £4 million, 5.08 million, provided by Ireland in humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan this year is balanced in its delivery between those at risk within the country and those who are seeking protection in neighbouring states such as Pakistan and Iran. This is being provided through Irish NGOs such as Concern, Trócaire, GOAL and Christian Aid, and through the appropriate UN and International Red Cross and Crescent agencies which have the necessary working access to deliver aid to those most in need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I remain very concerned about the situation in Africa in relation to starvation and political stability. They remain major obstacles to the development of the continent. Last January, the World Food Programme presented a world hunger map which illustrated the scale of the problem of global hunger, now estimated as affecting 830 million people worldwide. The problem is particularly acute in Africa, with up to 16 million people affected by hunger in the greater Horn of Africa <Col N="1271" /> alone. Working in close co-operation with UN and EU partners, Ireland Aid has been to the forefront of international efforts to respond to humanitarian crises in Africa including Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda and the Great Lakes region, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Angola and Sierra Leone. In 2000, Ireland Aid provided over £8.5 million&ndash; 10.8 million &ndash; to fund emergency relief and rehabilitation programmes for the affected regions of the continent. Emergency funding to the continent last year represented almost 70% of the total emergency assistance budget.</P>
      <P>We have also actively supported efforts to improve the international community's ability to respond to humanitarian crises in Africa. At EU level, Ireland has participated in a major evaluation intended to improve the effectiveness of EC food aid and food security policy. This study recommended a number of changes to EU policy in this area to make it more effective and responsive. These included a refocusing of efforts towards strategic and sectoral issues, the introduction of country strategy papers to assist in streamlining rules and procedures and closer co-ordination of efforts with NGOs and recipient governments. In September 2000, the European Commission presented a communication on the evaluation and future orientation of food aid policy and food aid management, which will give effect to the recommendations of the evaluation with a view to enhancing the effectiveness of EC food aid.</P>
      <P>In September 2000, the UN Millennium Summit endorsed the goal of reducing by half by 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. The Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the plan of action, adopted at the World Food Summit, WFS, in 1996 set out the way towards the achievement of the goal. Food security requires an enabling political, social and economic environment, designed to create the best conditions for the reduction of poverty and a durable peace based on the full and equal participation of women and men.</P>
      <P>The Government is dealing with the inter-related issues of starvation and political stability in Africa through an unprecedented increase in the volume of overseas development assistance in line with Ireland's commitment to reaching the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on ODA by 2007; using our current membership of the UN Security Council to work towards resolving conflicts in Africa which are inhibiting food security and increasing the numbers of people suffering from hunger; participating in UN peacekeeping operations in regions of conflict, such as the UN mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea &ndash; UNMEE; and providing funding for the key UN organisations &ndash; World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organisations, International Fund for Agricultural Development &ndash; involved in helping the starving and in promoting food security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important initiative will be the follow-up to the World Food Summit. Ireland will be playing an active part in the follow up to this con<Col N="1272" /> ference, which has been re-scheduled to take place next year. This summit will provide an important opportunity to review progress towards meeting the WFS target, and to renew global commitment at political level to the task of eliminating hunger and malnutrition and to the achievement of sustainable food security for all vulnerable people, especially those living in Africa.</P>

      <P>The Government provides bilateral development assistance in the form of country programmes operated by Ireland Aid to six countries in Africa, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. Support for developing countries in Africa is also provided through development projects and programmes which are co-financed with Irish, international and indigenous non-governmental organisations &ndash; NGOs &ndash; and missionary groups. In addition, Ireland Aid provides support for the protection of human rights and the promotion of democratisation and good governance, as well as funding emergency and rehabilitation initiatives. Support under these various headings was directed to the following African countries during 2000: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>Ireland Aid also provides assistance through a grant-in-aid to the Agency for Personal Service Overseas &ndash; APSO &ndash; for the funding and co-funding of qualified personnel. The following African countries benefited from such assistance during 2000: Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>In line with best practice in international development co-operation, the Government also channels funds to the developing countries of Africa through multilateral organisations, primarily through the United Nations system, for example, UNDP, UNICEF, UNHCR, WHO, the European Union and the World Bank group. These organisations provide assistance to countries throughout the entire African continent. A detailed breakdown of projects and programmes supported by the Government through the Ireland Aid programme will be available in the Ireland Aid annual report for 2000 which will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>Following the Taoiseach's announcement at the UN Millennium Summit in September 2000 of substantially increased funding for development co-operation, the Government decided to establish a review of Ireland Aid in order to provide the best possible basis for the planned development of the programme. The review committee is expected to complete its work shortly and its report will be considered by the Government in preparation for the expansion of the Ireland Aid programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost a year since Eritrea and Ethiopia signed a comprehensive peace agreement in Algiers bringing an end to their border war. The Algiers agreement was the result of intensive negotiations under the auspices of the Organisation for African Unity, the United States and the European Union.</P>
      <P>The international community strongly supports the agreement and is very active in monitoring its implementation. The United Nations has deployed a 4,200 strong UNMEE force, United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, to monitor the ceasefire and to assist in ensuring the observance of the security commitments agreed by the parties &ndash; Security Council Resolution 1320 of 15 September 2000. Some 220 Irish soldiers will shortly be deployed to Asmara as part of this mission.</P>
      <P>Since the implementation of the agreement, much progress has been achieved. With the exception of some isolated incidents, Ethiopia and Eritrea have complied with their commitment to keep the peace. Nevertheless, difficulties have arisen with regard to Eritrean co-operation on several issues. Eritrea does not officially recognise the existence of the temporary security zone &ndash; TSZ &ndash; and so will not give details of the numbers of militia there, nor is it willing to offer information on the redeployment of troops or to permit freedom of movement for the inspection of troop movements. There are an estimated 10,000 militia and police in the TSZ, which makes the work of UNMEE more difficult.</P>
      <P>I raised these issues with Eritrean Foreign Minister Abdalla when I met him in New York last week. I urged the Eritrean Government to co-operate fully with UNMEE, particularly in relation to the movement of troops. I also voiced my strong disappointment at the expulsion of the Italian ambassador to Eritrea in September. Italy is the acting EU Presidency in Eritrea and the ambassador was expelled after he delivered an EU <i>démarche</i> expressing our deep concern at the arrest of reformers and growing restrictions on press freedom. Foreign Minister Abdalla assured me of Eritrea's ongoing commitment to reinforced relations with the EU. He stated that Eritrea was working to resolve the issue of the Italian ambassador's expulsion and hoped to move forward on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further issue raised by Ireland at the meeting with Foreign Minister Abdalla was our concern about internal developments in the country, including the crackdown on the opposition and restrictions on the independent media. In addition, the General Affairs Council on 19 November adopted conclusions on Eritrea expressing the EU's deep concern about persistent infringe<Col N="1275" /> ments of the opposition's rights, curbs on press freedom and the lack of information on prominent figures who are being detained. The Council regretted that no solution had been found to the Italian ambassador's expulsion and emphasised the urgent need for Eritrea to engage in a dialogue with the EU to address our concerns regarding recent developments and the need for a firm timetable for the organisation of free and fair elections, the first since independence from Ethiopia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I chaired the public meeting of the Security Council on East Timor in New York on 31 October 2001 at which I listened to views from the UN Special Representative to East Timor, Sergio Viera de Mello, and Chief Minister Alkatiri about the progress that country has made in its transition towards independence.</P>
      <P>In August, the first elections to a constituent assembly took place, marking a historic step in East Timor's transition to full independence to be declared on 20 May 2002. At that stage, the United Nations Transitional Administration of East Timor &ndash; UNTAET &ndash; will come to an end. The UN is committed to remaining engaged in post-independence East Timor to protect the major achievements so far realised by UNTAET, to build upon those achievements in co-operation with other actors and, most importantly, to assist the East Timorese people and Government in ensuring security and stability.</P>
      <P>Following the public meeting of the UN Security Council, I issued a presidential statement outlining the UN's plans for a successor mission to UNTAET. This mission will be headed by a special representative of the Secretary General and will comprise a military component, a civilian police component and a civilian component, including experts who would provide crucial assistance to the emergent East Timorese administration.</P>
      <P>While East Timor has experienced unprecedented success in its transition to date, the challenges facing the East Timorese people remain significant. Even with political progress, the country's economic prospects are such that it will be essential to maintain significant international aid flows to put it on a viable economic footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National reconciliation represents perhaps the country's most serious challenge. Years of intra-Timorese conflict, much accentuated by Indonesia's destabilising policies during the occupation, have depleted the nation in waiting of the social trust vital to building a cohesive society. A truth, reception and reconciliation commission has been established by the UN in an effort to facilitate the reintegration of East Timorese involved in the <Col N="1276" /> atrocities carried out by pro-Jakarta militia in 1999.</P>
    <P>Much still remains to be done as East Timor moves forward in nation-building, with the drafting of a constitution, the formation of a Government and preparation for presidential elections. The Government remains committed to supporting East Timor throughout this important process, into independence and beyond. The evolution of the Ireland Aid programme in East Timor reflects this. The programme will grow from £1 million this year to £2.5 million next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>Stability in the western Balkans remains a high priority for Ireland and for our partners in the EU. The situation in the region is discussed at every meeting of the EU General Affairs Council. At the most recent meeting of the Council on 19 and 20 November discussions focused on the elections held in Kosovo on 17 November, relations between Serbia and Montenegro and the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia &ndash; FYROM. I have dealt with the situation in FYROM in reply to another question.</P>
      <P>The progress achieved since the overthrow of Milosevic and the establishment of democracy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its constituent republic of Serbia has allowed an intensification of the EU's relations with the region. Ireland firmly supports the regional approach of the European Union in deepening co-operation with all the countries of the former Yugoslavia and providing solid foundations for increased prosperity and stability in south east Europe as a whole. The stabilisation and association process &ndash; SAP &ndash; represents the best way forward in terms of the integration of the western Balkans countries into European structures while building regional co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two meetings between the EU and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia &ndash; FRY &ndash; have taken place with a view to opening negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement, SAA, similar to those already signed with Croatia and FYROM. When I recently met the Yugoslav For<Col N="1277" /> eign Minister in New York, he stressed the importance of this process in the context of achieving internal institutional change, reform of the judiciary, human rights and the restructuring of the security forces.</P>
    <P>Bilaterally, Ireland has contributed £318,000 to refugee assistance programmes in Serbia and Montenegro in 2001 as well as £884,000 in aid to Kosovo. Ireland is also an active participant in the stability pact for south eastern Europe through which we are funding a number of projects in the areas of local democracy, support for the media and refugee return.</P>
    <P>Ireland, with our partners in the EU, is also working with Albania in the framework of the SAP. The EU is assisting Albania in preparing for SAA negotiations as soon as possible. Ireland also funds three personnel working with the OSCE mission to Albania.</P>
    <P>Kosovo remains a key factor for regional stability. Ireland, along with our other EU partners, welcomed the peaceful and orderly way in which the legislative elections were conducted. These first Kosovo-wide elections mark an important step forward in the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 &ndash; 1999. At the last General Affairs Council, I joined my EU colleagues in calling for the newly elected Kosovars to carry out their functions in strict compliance with Resolution 1244 and with the constitutional framework for provisional self-government and urged the elected authorities to co-operate fully with UNMIK and the Belgrade authorities. The structured contacts laid out between the UN, Belgrade and the provisional institutions have the potential to be an effective instrument in addressing the legitimate concerns of minority communities, particularly in the area of security and refugee return.</P>
    <P>Ireland chaired a public meeting on Kosovo during our presidency of the UN Security Council in October after which a presidential statement was issued which called on the Belgrade authorities to support participation of Kosovar Serbs in the vote. During my meeting with Minister Svilanovic, I welcomed the support which was subsequently given by the federal Government to Serb participation in the elections. I was particularly gratified by the actual level of participation by Serbs. Ireland contributed 29 polling station supervisors as well as one long-term and five short-term election observers to the elections.</P>
    <P>The future of the constitutional relationship between Serbia and Montenegro was also discussed at the most recent General Affairs Council meeting. In the conclusions which followed the meeting, we took the opportunity to urge the Belgrade and Podgorica authorities to hold a democratic and constructive dialogue in order to reach agreement quickly on constitutional arrangements that are acceptable to all parties. We made clear our preference for a democratic Montenegro within a democratic FRY and stressed the importance of avoiding any unilateral action which might threaten the internal stability of the <Col N="1278" /> FRY and the surrounding area. It is vital to avoid new divisions in the Balkans and in this context the Secretary General's high representative was asked to visit Belgrade and Podgorica in order to reaffirm the position of the EU and to promote further dialogue. The Council strongly emphasised that, if the current process was to result in a referendum, this would have to be conducted in accordance with the democratic standards of a constitutional state and with the Montenegrin constitution.</P>
    <P>Looking at the overall situation in the region, I am encouraged by the recent progress which has been made, particularly the peaceful elections in Kosovo and the decision of the FYROM Parliament to ratify the framework agreement. Ireland will continue to work with our partners in the EU, the UN, the OSCE and the stability pact for south east Europe to support the process of stability, development and reform in the region.</P>

      <P>The situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia &ndash; FYROM &ndash; particularly in light of recent violence in the north of the country, remains a matter of concern in view of its potential impact on peace and stability in the region. In my reply to a question from Deputy Durkan on 16 October, I reported on actions already taken up to that time by the European Union in relation to the situation in FYROM.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recent decision by the FYROM Parliament to ratify all of the constitutional changes set out in the Ohrid framework agreement of 13 August 2001. The vote on the constitutional amendments was also welcomed at the EU General Affairs Council on 19 November. These amendments guarantee minority rights for ethnic Albanians in FYROM and multi-ethnic representation in the state institutions. The ratification of the framework agreement is a major step towards achieving internal peace between the two ethnic communities in FYROM. The EU, at the same meeting of the GAC, announced that it is prepared to step up its efforts to bring about the <i>rapprochement </i>provided for in the stability and association agreement which FYROM has signed with the EU. The EU also recently announced an additional 12 million in emergency aid to FYROM.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met the Foreign Minister of FYROM, Mrs. Ilenka Mitreva, in New York on 10 November and assured her that Ireland will continue to work in co-operation with international organisations and the EU to assist FYROM. I also took the opportunity to stress the importance of developing regional co-operation as well as the stabilisation and association process and co-oper<Col N="1279" /> ation with the EU.

    <P>In order to ensure the return of government forces to former conflict zones, the rapid establishment of a multi-ethnic police force is crucial.

Ireland has also deployed a number of additional personnel to the EU and OSCE monitoring teams.</P>

      <P>Significant progress has been achieved in Mozambique over the past decade. The end of the brutal civil war and the establishment of a multi-party democracy have provided a strong basis for future political development. At the same time, the country's economy has experienced significant expansion.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that this political and economic progress remains fragile. Mozambique's economic performance is heavily dependent upon massive inflows of international assistance and considerable political tensions remain between Frelimo, the ruling party of President Chissano, and the opposition Renamo, led by Alfonso Dhlakama. The current political difficulties can be traced to the presidential and parliamentary elections of December 1999, which were disputed and challenged by Renamo. The supreme court ultimately ruled that the results were valid, a verdict also reached by international election observers.</P>
      <P>These difficulties exacerbated long-standing political tensions and gave rise to several outbreaks of violence. The most serious incident occurred a year ago when at least 28 people were killed in clashes between police and Renamo supporters in northern and central parts of the country. Renamo continues to demand more political concessions from President Chissano in exchange for an agreement by Renamo to accept its opposition status. In recent months a series of negotiations aimed at ending the political tension have taken place between the President and Mr. Dhlakama. While some progress has been made at these talks they have so far failed to resolve all outstanding matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Along with its EU colleagues, Ireland condemned the violence which took place last November and the excesses which accompanied the demonstrations. The dialogue between the two <Col N="1280" /> main parties remains the only viable way of overcoming the present political difficulties. It is essential the considerable progress achieved since the end of the civil war is not jeopardised. In June this year, the EU decided to reinforce the ongoing political dialogue with Mozambique. At the time, EU heads of mission met with both Foreign Minister Simao and the President of Renamo, Mr. Dhlakama, to discuss the dialogue. The EU and Mozambique share many common values such as democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and so the dialogue focuses on contributing to a consolidated political process and political stability to reinforce democracy in the country, lead to an increased respect for human rights, rule of law and good governance, and to promote national peace and reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Ireland recently participated in the 13th World Bank consultative meeting on Mozambique which took place on 25 and 26 October and concentrated on the host nation's development and financial requirements. The bank complimented the Government on its ongoing efforts to combat poverty, while at the same time highlighting the numerous difficult challenges that lie ahead. Ireland, along with other donors, welcomed the poverty reduction emphasis contained in the strategic paper passed by the Cabinet last April which articulates the Government's five year strategy for poverty reduction. Ireland also acknowledged the fact that Mozambique has reached the completion point for enhanced debt relief under the HIPC, heavily indebted poor countries, initiative as a significant achievement by the Government.</P>
    <P>Mozambique is a priority country for Ireland Aid, and a total of 19.68 million has been allocated for the programme budget for 2001. This figure will rise to over 30 million for 2002. Ireland has also contributed over 1.27 million in emergency aid to meet the humanitarian needs caused by the extensive flooding in 2000 and 2001.</P>
    <P>With its EU colleagues, Ireland will continue to monitor the situation in Mozambique closely and will make our concerns known where appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the political turmoil of recent years, the internal security situation in Rwanda remains relatively calm. The Government of President <Col N="1281" /> Kagame has been making important efforts to rebuild the country in the aftermath of the horrific genocide of 1994. The new Government of national unity has a term of four years until 2003, when elections are due to be held.</P>
      <P>The issue of the genocide is likely to continue to dominate the political agenda in Rwanda and efforts are being made to gradually rebuild the country's justice system which was almost completely destroyed in 1994. An International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda &ndash; ICTR &ndash; was set up in 1995 under UN Security Council Resolution 995 to try those most responsible for the genocide. Local courts, known as Gacaca, are also being set up to try genocide suspects who are still being detained, but who are not wanted by the ICTR, and community leaders are being trained to act as judges.</P>
      <P>On 19 November 2001, the EU General Affairs Council adopted a new common position on Rwanda which aims to encourage, stimulate and support national reconciliation; reconstruction and development; the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental civil liberties; and the transition to democracy. The common position welcomes the establishment of the Gacaca courts, which should administer justice in an even-handed way which is fair both to defendants and to their victims. The Gacaca system should not include the death penalty as a punishment.</P>
      <P>The EU is encouraged by the recent agreement between President Kagame and President Museveni of Uganda which aims to reduce sources of tension between the two countries and thereby contribute to regional stability.</P>
      <P>The UN Security Council issued a <i>démarche</i> to President Kagame in July 2001 urging the Rwandan Government to live up to its commitments and obligations to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1341 and withdraw its troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC. The EU has expressed the hope that such a withdrawal will encourage all sides to take further steps to implement the Lusaka Agreement and bring about a peaceful solution to the conflict in the Great Lakes region.</P>

      <P>During Ireland's candidacy for a seat on the United Nations Security Council, we made clear our intention to focus on issues of African concern should we be elected. In the 11 months since we took our seat we have followed through on this promise. One clear example of this commit<Col N="1282" /> ment is the prominence we gave to Somalia during our presidency of the Security Council in October 2001. On 19 October Ireland chaired the first full public debate on Somalia in 18 months. We took this initiative in the belief that the international community needs to refocus its attention on Somalia. The public debate was very constructive and the Security Council agreed to issue a substantial statement on the situation in the country.</P>
      <P>As President of the Security Council, I had the honour of issuing this statement on behalf of Council members. In the statement the Council reiterates its support for the Arta peace process, which led to the establishment last year of a transitional national assembly and Somalia's first government for more than a decade. The statement also recommends that the UN Secretary General dispatches an inter-agency headquarters-led mission to Somalia to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the security situation in the country and to prepare proposals for how the UN can assist the transitional national government.</P>
      <P>Ireland firmly believes that the Arta process continues to be the most viable basis for peace and national reconciliation in Somalia and we will continue to support it. Ireland is also a member of the International Partners Forum which supports the regional Inter-Governmental Authority on Development. We have indicated our support for IGAD's efforts to build peace and stability in Somalia, and see these efforts as complementary to the Arta process. In March this year Ireland participated in the joint IGAD-International Partners Forum meeting in Rome at which the situation in Somalia was discussed in detail. We are also conscious that the humanitarian circumstances in the country remains poor. Ten years without effective government and poor climatic conditions have seriously undermined the ability of the people to provide for themselves adequately. Consequently, Ireland has contributed over £800,000 in humanitarian assistance so far this year to meet the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable groups in Somalia.</P>

      <P>I have no responsibility in relation to the powers of local authorities. On the question of telecommunications, the forthcoming Communications (Regulation) Bill will contain provisions relating to access by telecommunications operators to public highways for the construction of telecommunications networks. Under the Bill, it is proposed that such operators will be required to obtain the consent of the local authority before they can open a road to lay telecommunications infrastructure in that authority's functional area. It is also proposed that a local authority will be able to make its consent subject to specific conditions enabling it to co-ordinate road openings and to require operators to share trenches and provide spare ducts for future use by other telecommunications operators.</P>
      <P>Contrary to recent media reports, there has been no decision to postpone the Bill. I am most anxious to have the Communications (Regulation) Bill progressed as soon as possible. The current position is that Bill is with the office of the parliamentary counsel to the Government. My Department is actively pursuing the matter with the Government legislation committee in order that the Bill will be assigned due priority in the legislation programme.</P>

      <P>The movement restrictions applying to licensed bulls are the same as those applying to other bovines.</P>
      <P>Farm to farm movement of cattle is permitted, provided a permit is obtained in advance from SWS in Bandon. In addition, movement may be permitted only where the animal in question has been resident on the holding from which it is to be moved for a minimum of 30 days.</P>
      <P>This rule was initially introduced as a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis. In this context, I am encouraged by the continued absence of new outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in Great Britain since 30 September. However, I still regard it as essential to maintain a precautionary approach to this virulent disease. The need for continued caution is underlined by the fact that, contrary to expectations, outbreaks have occurred in Britain in the past in areas deemed clear of the disease for a considerable period. Therefore, I considered that the extension of the movement controls for a further two months provides an additional safeguard in containment and control measures.</P>

      <P>The arrears in question arose from a restructuring of the pay scale for secretarial assistants in the Houses of the Oireachtas. To expedite the payment of the bulk of the arrears, only those relating to basic pay were processed initially. Accordingly, all arrears relating to basic pay were paid in June and September 1998. The calculation of the remaining arrears pertaining only to overtime was delayed because of the restructuring of several other grades, with priority again given to arrears of basic pay and the extensive work involved in changing the payroll system for ten Departments and offices in preparation for the euro.</P>
      <P>Calculation of these arrears is very labour-intensive and requires that each person's arrears be calculated individually. Some methods of speeding up the payment of the arrears due on overtime were suggested by my Department to the Houses of the Oireachtas. These methods involved paying approximated amounts, but were not acceptable to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The successful installation of the new euro-compliant payroll systems will allow the payment of these arrears to be pursued as a priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The waiting list initiative was introduced in 1993 to address the issue of hospital waiting lists. Since <Col N="1292" /> then dedicated funding has been made available to health agencies to enable them to reduce hospital waiting lists as much as possible and to bring waiting times to within reasonable limits. Some £34.5 million, 43.81 million, has been allocated under the waiting list initiative for 2001. Taken together with longer term measures associated with the investment of resources available under the national development plan, my aim is to achieve real progress in improving access to essential health services. I intend to address these issues in the context of the health Strategy and am confident of achieving real progress in the area of waiting lists and more importantly waiting times.</P>
      <P>Significant decreases have taken place in the number of patients waiting in the target specialties since June 2000; the number awaiting cardiac surgery is down by 52%, gynaecology is down by 35%, ophthalmology is down by 23%, orthopaedics is down by 14% and ENT is down by 30%.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has also been made in reducing waiting times in target specialties. Between June 2000 and June 2001 the number of children waiting for cardiac surgery for more than six months decreased by 85% and the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than six months decreased by 31%. During the same period the number of adults waiting for cardiac surgery for more than 12 months decreased by 68% and the number waiting for ophthalmology services for more than 12 months decreased by 38%.</P>
      <P>It is well recognised that the single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. A comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. The review has focused primarily on the emerging needs to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and longer terms. The review of bed capacity will inform the new health strategy.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers is the World Health Organisation report 2000 entitled, Health Systems: Improving Performance, published by the World Health Organisation. Com<Col N="1293" /> parison of the performance of health systems in an accurate and meaningful way is at a relatively underdeveloped stage as the report itself acknowledges. The fact that WHO intends to publish similar comparative indices on a regular basis in future world health reports should give an added impetus to improvement and refinement of the comparison measures.</P>
      <P>In the report to which the Deputy refers Ireland was ranked 19th among 190 countries in terms of the overall performance of its health system &ndash; above Germany which ranked 25th and the USA which ranked 37th. Performance was measured by relating achievement of health system goals in terms of health and its distribution; responsiveness and its distribution and fairness in financing to health expenditure.</P>
      <P>Ireland ranked very well &ndash; 6th-7th &ndash; in terms of fairness of financial contribution but did less well on measures of health and on responsiveness. On health performance we ranked 32nd. Health performance took into account not only health status, which was measured by disability adjusted life expectancy but also inequalities in the distribution of health in the population. However as indicated above, the Deputy should be aware that in the paper that gave rise to the publicity about Ireland's position the authors stated, &ldquo;Our conclusions are of course tentative. The quality of the data across countries varies greatly and only some of this is accounted for in our uncertainty analysis.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A number of reports, including the 1999 report of the chief medical officer, have drawn attention to the links between lower socio-economic position and poorer health status. In examining health status, it is important to recognise that it is influenced by several factors. These include people's natural endowment; the physical and emotional nurturing they receive; the lifestyle they adopt; the degree to which the health services and the wider environment support and complement their attempts to prevent disease and to improve their health as well as the access they have to quality health and personal social services in times of need.</P>
      <P>A high proportion of mortality and morbidity rates in Ireland are caused by chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer. A range of measures are in place to improve health status and mortality rates. These include the national cancer strategy, the national cardiovascular health strategy and the health promotion strategy. Last year I launched the health promotion strategy for the years 2000-05 which includes specific strategic aims and objectives to contribute to the overall health improvement of the Irish population.</P>
      <P>I am currently developing a national health strategy which will be published shortly. The new national health strategy will build on the current strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future &ndash; 1994, and will provide a blueprint for the strategic development of the health services over the next seven to ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> I have already mentioned the links between lower socio-economic status and poorer health which have been found in Ireland as in many other countries. The national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, is the Government's major vehicle for addressing the needs of people in poverty or experiencing social exclusion. Although health or health targets were not included in the original national anti-poverty strategy published in 1997, my Department has been involved in setting and reviewing annual workplans for the NAPS.</P>
    <P>A working group on setting health targets for the NAPS completed its report in July last. The report is currently being integrated with the NAPS reports from other Departments with a view to the adoption by Government of a revised NAPS later this year. Concurrently, the report of the NAPS and health working group has been informing the new national health strategy.</P>

During 1999 a wide consultation process involving adopted people, birth parents, adoptive parents and people working in adoption, especially tracing and reunion, was undertaken in the course of the drafting of the legislative proposals. The Bill provides for the establishment of a regulated, State funded tracing and reunion service to assist people to trace. I will be ensuring that adequate structures and resources are in place to provide this service in an appropriate and timely manner. The heads of the Bill are currently with the office of the parliamentary counsel for the drafting of the legislation.</P>

As a first step in this process, I convened a forum, which took place last June, to examine and explore the practical issues involved in preparing a system of registration for these practitioners. The Institute of Public Administration, which facilitated the forum, prepared a report on the discussions that took place <Col N="1295" /> on the day which was forwarded to the participants and other interested parties for consideration. I subsequently asked the Institute of Public Administration to prepare a report on proposals for the way forward. On receipt of this report, which I hope to obtain before the end of the year, I hope to be in a position to progress the issue further.</P>

      <P>The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, is responsible, <i>inter alia</i>, for meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers under the system of dispersal and direct provision which was introduced in April 2000. Under this system, the agency provides full board accommodation to asylum seekers in a number of settings including hostels, guesthouses, former hotels and system built accommodation centres while their claims for refugee status are being determined. In this regard, it should be noted that housing stock relative to population in Ireland is the lowest in the EU  &ndash; 334 per 1,000 at the end of 1999 compared with an EU average of 440 &ndash; and the private rental sector in this country is significantly smaller than in most European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the difficulties posed by this shortage of accommodation, the RIA has sourced 76 accommodation centres and nine reception centres across 24 counties. Each property used for <Col N="1302" /> providing accommodation and ancillary services to asylum seekers is inspected by officials from the agency prior to its use for the purpose of ascertaining its suitability having regard to a number of criteria, including: geographical location, taking into consideration proximity to centres of population, transport infrastructure and access to shops; health, education and welfare requirements of asylum seekers and the capacity of existing health, education and welfare services in the area to meet their requirements; the numbers of asylum seekers already accommodated in the area, by the agency, the size of the local indigenous population and proximity of schools, medical and other statutory and voluntary services; and the economic status of proposed centre locations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that a non-national must first obtain Irish citizenship before being eligible to hold an Irish passport. I have set out below some general information about the various ways a non-national can acquire Irish citizenship.</P>
      <P>A person whose father or mother was an Irish citizen at the time of his/her birth is an Irish citizen from birth. A person whose grandparent was born in Ireland may become an Irish citizen by registering in the foreign births register at an Irish embassy or consular office or at the Department of Foreign Affairs. A person whose great-grandparent was born in Ireland may register for Irish citizenship provided that their parent had registered in the foreign births register by the time of the person's birth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A non-national married to a person who is an Irish citizen &ndash; otherwise than by naturalisation, post-nuptial declaration or honorary citizenship &ndash; may accept Irish citizenship as his or her post-nuptial citizenship by lodging a declaration not earlier than three years from the date of the marriage or three years from the date the applicant's spouse became an Irish citizen through regis<Col N="1304" /> tration in the foreign births register, whichever is the later.</P>
    <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended in 1986, provides that the Minister for Justice may grant a certificate of naturalisation at his/her absolute discretion. The applicant has to fulfil certain statutory requirements including having a total of five years residency in the State in the nine year period preceding the date of the application. The Act also empowers the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to dispense with the statutory conditions in whole or in part, in certain specific circumstances, for example if the applicant is of Irish descent or has Irish associations.</P>
    <P>In view of his length of residency in the State, it appears that the person in question is eligible to apply for naturalisation and I have asked officials in the citizenship section of my Department to send the necessary forms to the Deputy for transmission to the individual concerned. If the person referred to considers that he may qualify for Irish citizenship in one of the other ways set out above, he can obtain further information, and the relevant forms, by telephoning the citizenship helpline, Telephone No. 01-602 8202, on any Tuesday and Thursday morning between the hours of 10.00 a.m. and 12.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>My Department will shortly reply to the correspondence in question.</P>
      <P>The person in question is travelling on a US passport and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary was therefore assumed to be a US national. US nationals, in common with all non-EEA nationals &ndash; the EEA is comprised of the member states of the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway &ndash; require the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to remain in the State. They are also required to register with their local Garda registration office if they intend to reside in the State for more than three months. Accordingly, once my Department has returned the passport of the person in question, she should contact the Garda superintendent's office for the area in which she resides and make arrangements to register there. Consideration can then be given to her particular circumstances and to the type and duration of permission to remain which may be granted to her. If the person in question has any documentation indicating that she is in fact an EEA national she should also present this to the registration office for consideration.</P>

      <P>My Department funds three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees.</P>
      <P>The statutory framework for the higher education grants scheme is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. It is the local authorities which, on behalf of my Department, administer the schemes, which are reviewed annually by my Department. The vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees are administered, on behalf of my Department, by the vocational education committees. All three schemes have broadly similar provisions relating, for example, to age, residency and means which govern the award of a grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the relevant local authority or VEC to which application for a grant must be made. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies based on the terms of the schemes which issue <Col N="1310" /> from my Department. These bodies do not refer applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. To date it appears that no such advice or instruction has been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>If an applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department. It is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Until such time as a decision has been made on an application by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund. The objectives of the fund, which is ESF aided, are to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies.</P>
    <P>The fund is administered on a discretionary and confidential basis by each third level institution and provides direct financial support to disadvantaged students to assist them to remain in college. I increased significantly the provision for this fund from £1.296 million in 1999 to £1.964 million in 2000.</P>

      <P>I am committed to providing supports, including an educational psychological service, to special schools such as St. Killian's that fulfil such an important role in our educational system. The National Educational Psychological Service is expanding to further schools as additional psychologists are appointed. As a feature of this expansion NEPS expects to become increasingly involved in the special education area, in collaboration with the psychological services provided by the health boards and by voluntary bodies.</P>
      <P>Until recently a psychological service was provided to St. Killian's school by a voluntary body under the aegis of the Southern Health Board. This service was withdrawn by the voluntary body from September 2001. At present NEPS is unable to replace this service due to insufficient staffing in the region. Recruitment for NEPS is in progress and it is hoped that it will be possible to expand its service in the southern region during the New Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The children in St. Killian's school have complex needs and many of them will need support from both clinical and educational psychologists. As a preliminary measure, a NEPS senior psychologist is currently undertaking a detailed <Col N="1312" /> analysis of the need in the school for psychological support. The outcome of this survey will inform discussions between NEPS and the voluntary body concerned about the appropriate type and level of psychological service that can be collaboratively provided for the school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Action Group on Access to Third Level Education makes detailed recommendations concerning the introduction of special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, usually referred to as top-up grants.</P>
      <P>The group considered that the target group of those most in need could best be defined in terms of the child dependants of people receiving long-term welfare payments, in respect of whom continued child dependant allowance is being paid, by virtue of their being in full-time education. In other words, child dependants in the age group 18 to 22.</P>
      <P>The group recommended that the special rates of maintenance grant should also be available to mature students, that is students aged 23 and over.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the special rate of maintenance grant a candidate must meet a number of conditions, one of which is that she or he must already qualify for one of my Department's ordinary maintenance grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three means tested maintenance grant schemes for third level students attending approved courses in approved third level institutions funded by my Department are: the higher education grants scheme, administered by the local authorities; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme, administered by the vocational education committees; and the third <Col N="1313" /> level maintenance grants scheme for trainees, administered by the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Where a student is already in receipt of a grant under one of these schemes, s/he may apply to the relevant local authority or VEC for the special rate of grant. Decisions on applications are taken by these bodies, based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. These bodies do not refer applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular condition is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student referred to by the Deputy. It is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Until a decision has been taken on an application by the relevant local authority or VEC, all inquiries regarding an application should be directed to the body concerned rather than to my Department.</P>
    <P>If an applicant considers that she or he has been unjustly refused the special rate of maintenance grant, she or he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
    <P>Where an applicant has had an appeal turned down in writing by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the conditions correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may in exceptional circumstances seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>
    <P>The eligibility requirements for the special rates of maintenance grant will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with a view to extending eligibility. A first step will be to assess the coverage and effectiveness of the implementation of the special rates in this first year of operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the maintenance grants schemes and the free fees initiative, under which my Department meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students in approved institutions, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the student assistance-access fund.
