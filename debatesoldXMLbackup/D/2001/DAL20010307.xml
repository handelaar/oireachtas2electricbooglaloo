      <P>Some weeks ago a Minister of State was bullied into resigning by an unelected official.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The press was misled. The Taoiseach bravely said, through his mouthpieces, that he would take action against Deputy Ned O'Keeffe if he did not resign secure in the knowledge that Deputy O'Keeffe had resigned an hour previously. The Taoiseach has been persistently discourteous in not replying to a letter of mine of 4 January which outlines a clear conflict of interest in that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is trying to raise the threshold of what can be spent on elections, to corrupt the outcome of Irish politics, while at the same time holding the position of joint treasurer of Fianna Fáil. It is not acceptable that the Order of Business should be agreed today. I am opposed to it.</P>

      <P>Tá an Comhaontas Glas ag diúltiú glacadh le Riar na hOibre chomh maith. Is beag is fiú faoin am seo an críoch déanach a chur ann mar go ndiúltaíonn an Taoiseach teacht isteach agus míniú a thabhairt dúinn ar éirí as an Aire Stáit O'Keeffe. Tá mé den tuairim chomh maith gur bheag gur fiú an críoch déanach mar nach mbíonn aon vóta ann ag an deireadh ar aon nós. Ceaptar go mbeadh go leor daoine imithe agus níl fhios agam cén fáth go bhfuilimid ag dul chomh déanach sin nuair nach mbeidh mórán daoine sa Teach.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is no doubt aware that there is free movement of sheep and lambs from Northern Ireland if the sheep and lambs are of Northern Ireland origin, but that if they come from the United Kingdom, there is no such free movement. This morning it was stated that veterinary and other experts from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland are of the view that up to 8,000 sheep and lambs of English origin came from the North during January. This is an enormous level of smuggling and I would like the Taoiseach to give assurances to the House that all these sheep and lambs have been traced and that he is satisfied that there is no risk of infection from foot and mouth disease as a result of the continual smuggling of sheep and lambs of English origin into this jurisdiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>The Minister has indicated that all records of potential imports from the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, have been traced back to 1 February. I cannot be certain that records were traced for all of January. As the Minister said yesterday, they are continuing to go further back in this process. Last week they had gone back as far as 1 February. There are a number of farms where currently or in the past there were suspicions. These account for some of the 567 farms which have been restricted for the purposes of precautionary veterinary examination. Clearly, in the last fortnight officials believe that they have managed to control the level of smuggling which did take place. Deputy Noonan's question concerned January in respect of which careful examination is necessary. Investigations have taken place in Carlow, Louth, Wicklow and a number of other areas. To reiterate what was said yesterday and what resulted from the interdepartmental meeting this morning, all the test results so far at all these locations and others are negative.</P>
      <P>We must continue to check and monitor as far back as we can. I cannot confirm the number as I do not know the level of smuggling. I do not know, therefore, if the figures mentioned this morning are correct. They are far higher than the figures mentioned here in the course of debate in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn asked about paramilitary activity. There have always been concerns about paramilitary involvement in the smuggling of cattle, sheep, fuels and other materials. This is continually kept under review. The enormous security operation on the Border, at least in our jurisdiction, has improved the position. There remains a worrying question, namely, the level of illegal movement in the Border area, which did not start yesterday, today or in this generation. It is a matter of concern for many reasons, not least animal health.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach realise that Members on this side of the House are very concerned that the information being provided by way of parliamentary question is not accurate in respect of the smuggling of lambs? I draw his attention in particular to a letter from the Minister for Finance to Deputy Ring in 1998 apologising for the erroneous information given to him about the smuggling of lambs in connection with a VAT scam. I also draw his attention to a reply from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on 2 February last year which states: &ldquo;I am not aware of any recent inci<Col N="389" /> dents of illegally imported lambs or sheep&rdquo;. So, nobody knows anything about anything in the usual tradition of movement in these areas. As late as 12 months ago categoric assurances were given to the House that there was no smuggling of lambs, while two years ago there was an apology to a Deputy&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that he can stand over the information given to the House and sourced in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development about sheep being moved from the North to the South? There is free passage if they are of Northern origin but there is no free passage if they come from Carlisle.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, his Minister of State and I have made it clear over the last ten or 12 days that while there is free movement on the island, and has been for a long time, any sheep coming in from elsewhere should not have <Col N="390" /> been put forward as sheep just moving between North and South in the normal way. We know that in the Carlisle case and perhaps in other cases that there are suspicions about the procedure followed and one of the reasons for the legislation approved by the Government yesterday and due before the House this week is to tie down registration, controls and penalties. The Department has traced back to 1 February but will go back as far as it can. I have already said the exclusion zones in operation in north Louth and other suspicious areas will continue and tracing will also continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, issue a statement to both Houses of the Oireachtas, at intervals not exceeding two months duration, on the latest statistical information on the effects of inflation on the measures contained in Parts 2, 3 and 4 of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This matter was discussed on Committee Stage. It relates to the unprecedented situation last year when the meagre social welfare increases across the board did not compensate social welfare recipients for an exceptional increase in the consumer price index and inflation in the latter part of the year. These amendments seek to insert in the Bill an obligation on the Minister to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas at intervals not exceeding two months to report the latest statistical information on the effects of inflation. This provision is crucial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main flaw with last year's Social Welfare Act was the inordinate increase in the CPI and its effects on those on low incomes. Inflation has devastating effects on those on low incomes, <Col N="397" /> particularly those on low fixed incomes. We saw such effects last year where the 3% increase in social welfare payments did nothing to compensate for increases in inflation, particularly in the latter part of the year.</P>
    <P>Who is to say that, between 1 April and 31 December 2001, the effects of inflation will not be revisited on those on low incomes? By accepting these amendments we would provide a mechanism whereby the Minister will have to, in effect, renegotiate social welfare increases. Last year the Minister sought Cabinet approval for a package of measures to help those on social welfare. However, he and his proposals were put to one side in a curt manner which did nothing to compensate those who had lost out due to inflation. The net result was that people on social welfare lost out last year because inflation outstripped the increases in allowances and benefits. That is why this amendment is crucial.</P>
    <P>In terms of general legislation it would be a good idea to allow some kind of inflation proofing device whereby the Minister can present the latest information to the House on a regular basis. Such a process would help his case before Cabinet colleagues and would not leave him in the exposed position in which he found himself last year. Accepting these amendments will strengthen the Minister's hand when he attempts to renegotiate packages during the year. Last year's experience could be revisited this year. Inflation is already having an impact on those on low incomes and we have to ensure that those incomes are adequately protected against the effects of inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year inflation had a disastrous impact on those on low incomes. Early last year the Opposition repeatedly questioned the Minister for Finance on the likely inflation figure for 2000. In the first few months after last year's budget inflation was dangerously higher than was anticipated but the Minister kept reassuring us that the annual rate would be 3.5% to 4%. In the event we had a disastrous situation before last Christmas where prices were rising at 6.8%. The paltry £4 increase which the Minister gave to the 1.5 million people who primarily exist on social welfare incomes was wiped out by inflation. There is no debate among economists that this actually happened.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I referred to an interesting report published by the ESRI. The report commended the Minister for a number of innovations he introduced in the past three and a half years. However, it also highlighted that he had failed to ensure that social welfare benefits kept pace with the rate of price increases. The ESRI concluded that social welfare increases kept ahead of inflation by just a few pence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality for many pensioners, those on invalidity and disability payments, carers, those on low incomes, children and others is that the cost of fuel, heating, food, transport and the gamut of family expenditure increased rampantly <Col N="398" /> last year. People rightly felt in a fragile mood as no one knew whether the situation would worsen. That is the reason for these amendments.</P>
    <P>There is still concern about the effects of inflation this year. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has again insisted that, given the experience of last year, we will not have the same disastrous inflation rate this year. However, there is still concern about this issue and that is why amendment No. 4 seeks to oblige the Minister to report to the House to see how we can alleviate the problems suffered by those on social welfare incomes as the year progresses.</P>
    <P>This is an exciting year in one sense. There are nine months to go to what is probably one of the most dramatic events in our history when we join the single currency. We were linked to an international currency for many centuries and most argue that its impact was disastrous for us as it was combined with trading restrictions which held the nation back for hundreds of years. However, we are heading into this development in an era of free trade where our own ingenuity, entrepreneurship and hard work will enable us to survive.</P>
    <P>The past two years or so have been a bit helter-skelter and who is to say that the situation will not be worse after 1 January 2002, particularly for the first few months. There will be some confidence once the currency is in our pockets and as we trade in euros. If he is still in government the Minister will have the comfort of knowing that rates will appear higher when given in euros while not being any higher in real terms.</P>
    <P>Many seniors' groups in my constituency have expressed concern that, as happened in the early 1970s, there will be an attempt to rip people off when paying for groceries, drink, transport and so on as the new currency is introduced. There are genuine concerns that it will be a difficult time for people and we must keep the situation under review.</P>
    <P>I referred to the attempts by the Minister's media friends, particularly one who writes for, I think, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, who put out favourable stories towards the end of last year regarding the Minister's deep concern about this issue, knowing that he had not provided for increases in social welfare payments but that he was going to do something about this. The Minister went to Cabinet where, tragically, the PD wing of Fianna Fáil, led by the Minister for Finance, with the sole PD Cabinet member, told him to get lost. This was the story spun by the Minister's spin doctors for friendly journalists.</P>
    <P>The reality was that all the Minister succeeded in getting was an increase in the Christmas allowance from 70% to 100%, which I have suggested for as long as I have been party spokesperson. The Minister should have introduced this measure two years ago. He finally did so but there is a problem. Fortunately, on the initiative of my colleagues in the trade union movement, a review mechanism was inserted into the Pro<Col N="399" /> gramme for Prosperity and Fairness so that if inflation went haywire working people could be protected. That review mechanism was successfully triggered by the trade union movement, including Mr. Cassells, Mr. Geraghty and other colleagues. A re-negotiation took place and people got additional money. The Minister, Opposition spokespersons and backbenchers are the only people who can insert any kind of review mechanism for social welfare recipients, but it is not there. If my party is involved in Government after the forthcoming general election I hope it will insert such a mechanism in the Social Welfare Bill, although it would be more difficult for the Minister of the day. He would constantly have to keep a sharp eye on the Minister for Finance to monitor prices. He would also have to be alert and willing to protect people on low fixed incomes in the social welfare system. At the moment, however, there is no such mechanism and that is the reason for amendments Nos. 2 and 4 which are very important.</P>
    <P>A few years ago my colleague, the former Minister, Deputy De Rossa, said he felt that such a mechanism should have been considered. At this stage we should formally implement it and have a system whereby increases are given to social welfare recipients. The Minister provided for increases before Christmas, although most interest groups and representative bodies in the social welfare area wanted a basic increase of at least £10, and the general request was for £14 per week given the resources available through a huge budget surplus. The Minister did not go the full mile; he went part of it but it may not be enough to keep ahead of inflation. I urge the Minister to consider these important amendments in order to cope with inflation and rising prices for people on low fixed incomes.</P>

      <P>Seeking a report based on inflation is an old chestnut. It is a bit like cutting and pasting last year's amendments. I note that amendment No. 4 refers to &ldquo;the Act of 2000&rdquo; which was last year's Bill, but this will be the 2001 Act. There was a bit of jockeying for position because Deputy Hayes's amendment No. 2 refers to section 1(3), while Deputy Broughan &ndash; who probably had the amendment in first, because it was on the first list &ndash; has inserted it as a separate section.</P>

      <P>In 1997, when Deputy Broughan was canvassing votes on the doorsteps, I am sure he felt the brunt of the actions of Deputy De Rossa in the increase he gave to old age pensioners as Minister for Social Welfare. Given the inflation rate at the time, that increase could be compared unfavourably to the increases that have been given in 2000 and 2001. Child benefit has increased between 54% and 59%, personal rates have risen from between 10.4% and 11.7%, and the widow's or widower's contributory pension has risen by 14.5%. Those type of increases are prevalent throughout all the payments provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office is an excellent body and there is an opportunity on a regular basis for Deputies to use their own computers to figure out what the changes are and how they correspond with inflation. When the budget was announced, inflation was at its highest level but it has fallen by more than 2% since then. Fortunately or otherwise, when the Minister was seeking funds for increases inflation was at its peak. That may have helped the Minister to obtain these excellent increases in social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>With regard to the financial aspects of any bill, I note that Opposition spokespersons always seek bi-monthly or quarterly reports to compare inflation with social welfare increases. The business of the House could be taken up forever with such statistical reports from the CSO, but those reports could easily be made up by researchers or by Deputies themselves. If there is a problem it can be brought to the notice of the Dáil either by question or motion. These amendments would not be helpful, either to the Bill or to the political process of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for tabling these amendments. I concur with Deputy Ardagh who made some excellent and very relevant points as to whether such a review mechanism is necessary. There is a committee of the House which can monitor inflation trends, and Deputy Ardagh is a member of it. My Department also constantly monitors the inflation rate. I will give Deputies some figures to illustrate this. The Estimate for social welfare rose this year by 15.5% over last year, and in the preceding year it rose by 7.7%. The social welfare budget level has risen significantly and these are probably the highest increases in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> The budget provided for a social welfare increase of £850 million, which is more than double the previous year's figure and more than four times what it was just four years ago when Members of the Opposition were in Government. We on this side of the House need not take any lectures from those on the opposite benches. When we came into office, we undertook to pay real increases in social welfare and that is what the people have got. Because of the trends in inflation towards the latter half of last year, the Government decided to compensate people through the increases given in the budget, which are now manifesting themselves in this Bill. Not only did we give the normal real increase for this year but we allowed for inflation towards the latter end of last year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan referred to the Christmas bonus. Whenever my party was in Government, the rate of Christmas bonus was either maintained or increased. This time, we are bringing the Christmas bonus back up to the 100% level at which it was first introduced in 1980. I remind the Deputies opposite that, when their parties were in Government, and only then, the Christmas bonus was reduced. In 1985, when they were in Government, if my memory serves me correctly, the bonus was reduced from its original 1980 level of 100% down to 75%. In the following year, 1986, it was further reduced to 65%.</P>
    <P>When my party was in Government in 1989, we increased it to 70%, where it has remained ever since. The opposition parties were in Government for some intervening years but they did not increase it. This Government, of which my party is the major member, has increased the Christmas bonus to 100% and we take some pride in that. Added to that, there was a compensatory element in this year's increases for the difficulties which arose mainly for people on the general increase, rather than for old age pensioners, although the latter also got very substantial increases.</P>
    <P>With regard to the euro changeover on 1 January next, to which Deputy Broughan referred, I fully accept that it will be difficult for people, just as decimalisation was. I have already given a commitment in the House, as has the Minister for Finance, that no social welfare recipients will lose out in the process. Where relevant, people will gain, because all social welfare payments will be rounded up to the nearest 10 cents.</P>
    <P>As far as the State's position is concerned, there will be no &ldquo;skulduggery&rdquo;, if that is what the Deputy is referring to. While I cannot speak for what may happen outside of my own Department's sphere of influence, there is obviously an issue to be addressed by other Departments and by the Consumers' Association, in relation to the situation in shops throughout the country. I suggest to Deputy Broughan that he should allay people's fears, rather than adding to them, though perhaps he is not doing so. He should relay this Government's guarantee that social welfare payments will be rounded up to the nearest 10 cents and that people will not lose out. <Col N="402" /> Given that increases will come into effect from 1 January, people will gain very substantially as a result of changes in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>At the risk of repetition, which Deputies opposite have also engaged in, I remind the House of the Government's action, over the past four budgets, in progressively bringing forward the date of payment of social welfare increases, which used to apply only from late June or early July. The timing of social welfare increases and changes in taxation will now coincide, for the first time in living memory, on 5 April this year and on 1 January next year. The latter adjustment represents a cost to the exchequer, and a gain to the recipients, of £85 million.</P>

I have no doubt that, when we go to the people next year, they will recognise and appreciate the significance of what we are doing in that regard. In relation to child benefit, we have given an undertaking that we will bring the payments forward progressively. This year's substantial child benefit payments will be made in June, as compared to September last year and every previous year. The Government is proud of its record in starting on this route. None of the parties opposite did anything in that respect when they were on this side of the House. The increases in child benefit this year are a massive £25 each for the first two children and £30 each for the third and subsequent children. The corresponding increases given by the previous Government, in their last budget just three and a half years ago, were only £1 and £5 respectively and&mdash;</P>

The Deputy should not mislead the people, having failed to take the opportunity to check it out between Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, the Consumer Price Index, which is published monthly by the Central Statistics Office some four weeks after the date to which it refers, sets out the rate of inflation for the month in question. It is, and always has been, standard <Col N="403" /> practice in my Department, when preparing the budgetary estimates, to look at the overall situation for the year. The figures are based on a projection of inflation for the following year and, if there is any problem, the compensatory element comes into play in the following year. For example, in one recent year, the Department of Finance's forecast rate of inflation, on which the budget was predicated, was 2%. However, the actual inflation figure came to 1.6%, leaving people with a gain of 0.4%.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy ever gets to this side of the House, he will be better informed. The people concerned gained. When this year's problem came, particularly in relation to people on the general increase, that was taken care of in the payments which we are now discussing and which Fine Gael and Labour Deputies voted against. I trust that my colleagues on this side of the House have made it widely known&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;that Fine Gael and Labour voted against increases of £10 for old age pensioners, £8 in general increases, £25 for the first two children and £30 for the third and subsequent children.</P>
      <P>I repeat that the increase in the social welfare provisions of last December's budget amounted to £850 million, or four times greater than anything given by the rainbow coalition. The significant improvements in the levels of weekly rates represent increases ranging from 9% to 14.5%, which is way ahead of the forecast rate of inflation for the coming year.</P>
      <P>This means, in effect, that there will be real increases of between 4.3% and 9.6% this year based on an expected rate of inflation of 4.5%. Payments to couples are being increased by between 7.2% and 11.2% in real terms.</P>
      <P>In addition to providing for real increases ahead of projected inflation, this year's budget increases also compensate for reductions in the level of real increases provided for last year which arose as a result of the higher than expected rate of inflation. As stated on Committee Stage, the Government, on entering office, committed itself to providing for real increases, namely, increases ahead of the rate of inflation. For example, social welfare pensioners aged 66 years and over have received total increases of between 36% and 41.5%. This represents an overall real increase of between 19% and 24% when compared to increases in the cost of living during the period in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is illustrative to provide figures in respect of rates of inflation in recent years. In 1995, when, <Col N="404" /> as Deputy Broughan lovingly stated, Deputy De Rossa was Minister&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Hayes does not want to hear the truth. If Members consider the real increases and then the percentage increases, taking account of the CPI, which have been given during the lifetime of the Government, the figures indicate that we have given more than any previous Administration. I outlined the position on old age pensioners, but a similar situation obtains in respect of non-old age pensioners who have received real increases well above any previously provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the PPF, we undertook to make substantial progress in the period to 2003 towards <Col N="405" /> increasing pension payments to £100 per week. In the recent budget, we totally fulfilled our commitments in that regard. Deputy Broughan stated that there is no mechanism, other than the Department, to cater for the needs of social welfare recipients. I disagree with that assertion. He is doing a disservice to the organisations in the voluntary and community pillar&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <P>&mdash;and his so-called colleagues in the trade unions who always state that they are looking after the needs of those on social welfare. I would like the trade unions to place greater emphasis on catering for the needs of those in employment in the partnership discussions. However, that is a matter for the unions. The Deputy is doing a disservice to the organisations in the voluntary and community pillar which were good advocates on behalf of those on social welfare payments in the negotiations on the PPF.</P>
      <P>In the negotiations on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which was signed late last year, it was agreed that a working group comprising representatives from the various social partners, including the unions, would be established to examine the range of complex issues associated with the benchmarking and indexation of adult and child social welfare payments. As part of its deliberations, the working group will be examining the implications of adopting a specific approach to the ongoing up-rating or indexation of payments, including their long-term economic, budgetary, PRSI contribution, distributive and incentive implications in the light of trends in economic, demographic and labour markets.</P>

They felt that the Minister had taken a step forward in that this year, for the first time, he was talking in terms of increases in social welfare related to income. If we get an opportunity to be in the Minister's seat that is the area on which we will concentrate. Social welfare increases related to income increases, but the difficulty is that the workers, through the trade union movement, had an opportunity to review their increases. For three years running this Minister will not give social welfare recipients the same rights.</P>

      <P>In the previous year, 1999, it was plus 1.6%. That was the year when the expected rate of inflation from a social welfare point of view was 2%, so people had an actual gain of 0.4%. In 1998, it was 2.4%. In 1997, it was 1.5% and in 1996 it was 1.6%.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>We have done an amazing amount of work over the past four budgets but I suggest that outside observers should check the record. During our time we have kept ahead of the average gross industrial earning in percentage terms in relation to social welfare. The same cannot be said for the period the parties opposite were in Government. That is one of the real yardsticks as to how a Government can perform one way or the other.</P>
      <P>To come back to the point about a report, I have suggested to the Deputies that there is a role for the committee in regard to monitoring inflation but when one is in a Department like this and subject to the parameters of examining the 12 month period ahead, one has to have a forecast for inflation. That forecast last year was set at 3%; for this coming year it is set at 4.5%. In the framing of the budget for social welfare, cognisance is taken of that and on all occasions this Government has been in office, we have endeavoured to give real increases. In fact, we have achieved real increases for people over the lifetime of this Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not shed much light, despite his filibuster tactics in the House this morning, on the situation that affects poor people but he has put his finger on one particular policy that I would like to talk about in my concluding remarks. This is very interesting because it goes to the heart of the matter. In the course of his original comments on this set of amendments and in relation to how the increases can be given to people, the Minister said that the compensation will take place the following year. That is an interesting policy initiative from this Government. What he is actually saying is that poor people will have to wait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case if one is in the agricultural sector. I readily admit that I do not come from an agricultural background. I come from an urban background, but any time there is a crisis in agriculture, the next day the Government responds with a package of measures, whether it is in Brussels or in Dublin, and rightly so. That is not the case in relation to property. Only last week in the Finance Bill we saw dramatic changes to the entire Government policy in relation to housing because it did not suit the landlord sector. What happens? Within a month they get their changes through the House but when it comes to poor people demanding an increase in their basic rate of pay to deal with the hyper-inflation that sometimes can occur on a three or four month basis, we are told that the compensation will take place the following year. <Col N="411" /> That is the kernel of this debate because it is a systematic policy initiative on the part of this Government and, I accept, on the part of previous Governments. I will readily concede that. It is a systematic policy in relation to income distribution that the poor will have to wait.</P>
      <P>The amendments we are now debating, No. 2 in my name and No. 4 in the name of Deputy Broughan, attempt for the first time to change that because they will clearly establish a new principle that where inflationary effects have such a devastating impact on the meagre incomes of very poor people, we will immediately kick in with intervention. That is what we are doing. We are saying that the same kind of intervention that is made for the property market and for agriculture will equally apply to social welfare recipients. We are just extending a principle that is currently in place.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us many history lessons and much of it was erroneous. I want to put on the record a recent reply I received from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. I asked the Minister to set out total social welfare expenditure from 1996 to 2001, and the Minister is right. We have seen an increase in total expenditure on social welfare. In 1996, £4.3 billion was spent on the total provisions for that year. In 1997 the figure was £4.5 billion, in 1998 it was £4.7 billion, in 1999 it was £4.9 billion, last year the figure was £5.3 billion and this year the figure is expected to be about £6.5 billion. I accept that. Let us look at the amount of money in the economy in those years. In 1996 we had a deficit of £36 million, no surplus cash. In 1997, thanks to the rainbow Government's good management, it was reduced to £35 million, and then things took off. In 1998 there was almost £1 billion pounds surplus, in 1999, £1.1 billion and in 2000, £2.4 billion. This year we are likely to have a substantial surplus.</P>
      <P>The Minister has an unprecedented opportunity to lift the poor out of the current appalling income traps in our society. Lectures in warped historiography over a five year period will not get the Minister away from the principal fact that he has the opportunity to do something. He is not doing enough, not being radical enough in affecting incomes policy. That must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is my first involvement from Second Stage to Report Stage of social welfare legislation. This debate is a nonsense which makes a mockery of <Col N="412" /> the Dáil because it is clear from our dialogue with the Minister on Committee and Report Stages that he is not interested in any ideas from the Opposition. This is unprecedented in my time in the House. As I understand it, in any Bill, the Government takes on board sensible suggestions from the Opposition. Otherwise, as is the case with this Bill, it becomes a party political lash for the Opposition and Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister was bigger than that. We will have the ridiculous situation that the budget will be announced in the first week of December and we will have to put the Social Welfare Bill through by 31 December in order to effect the changes by 1 January with no opportunity to contribute constructively to it. This is not just about money. I understand the Minister is implementing financial commitments outlined by the Minister for Finance in December. It is about how the House conducts its business. These amendments afford us the opportunity to do something radical and to have the Minister come before the House to explain how his proposals affect very poor people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan referred to the 1.2 million people dependant on social welfare. Very few people speak up for them. I do not care if that is taken as a slight on anyone in the voluntary sector. The poor are not regarded as a priority. If a person has property, is in the agricultural sector, in full employment with a union to negotiate for him, then he is on the inside track. Those on the outside track, that 1.2 million dependant on the provisions of this Bill and our deliberations, have little pulling power when it comes to policy initiatives. Therefore, it is the Opposition's obligation to put these amendments without fear or favour. This is a kernel amendment of the 43 before the House at this Stage. Because of the unprecedented financial opportunity the Minister has, there is the chance to do something real and systematic for poor people rather than wait for next year.</P>
      <P>This morning's discussion was interesting because it exposed systematic discrimination against poor people who have to wait for another year unlike any other sector in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passage of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the rationale for the differing commencement dates of social welfare payment increases.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage. It would be churlish not to recognise the progress that has been made this year in that most of the changes resulting from this Bill will now be implemented in the first week of April. We all welcome that. However, there should not be any difference in the commencement dates of any of the social welfare increases. In the context of the UK, where the budget is being presented in the House of Commons today, all of the increases in social welfare payments are effective from the day of the budget. We should move in that direction. Last December, when the Minister for Finance presented his financial resolutions to the House, the impression was created that the changes outlined would be operative immediately, but most people have to wait for a considerable number of months before they can benefit from those changes.</P>
    <P>What I am seeking in this amendment is a report to the House from the Minister on the rationale for varying commencement dates for social welfare payment increases, specifically child benefit. The Minister has improved the situation and is now implementing the increases in child benefit from 1 June instead of in September. That is a welcome measure and I concede its usefulness. However, I would like those payments to be brought forward to April. I understand from our Committee Stage deliberations that this would cost about £85 million this year. It would be worth paying and would be good value for money. Given that this has been highlighted from December last, the very least we could do is implement all of these changes from April.</P>
    <P>We had a good dialogue on this on Committee Stage, but we need finality in relation to next year's provisions. It is likely that we will have a budget in the first week of December this year and that virtually all of the social welfare and tax changes will come into effect on 1 January 2002. What impact will that have, specifically in relation to child benefit? Will the commencement date of that increase be the same as for the other general increases in social welfare? We do not lack the finances to do it, and many families depend on child benefit and have been calling on the Government to dramatically increase it over the past three to four years when resources were available. They would appreciate this change. It would be worthwhile. I recommend this amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this amendment. It seems incongruous that any major social welfare benefit should not come into operation at the same time as the whole range of social assistance and social insurance payments. I note that on Committee Stage the one area in respect of which the Minister would not give us a commitment was in relation to the timing of child benefit next year and on bringing it directly into line with all the other increases. The measure to bring forward the general increases to April this year was <Col N="416" /> extremely welcome as is bringing forward to June the implementation of increases in child benefit. However, there seems not to be a fundamental reason all assistance and insurance payments should not come into effect at the same time as changes in tax and personal allowances for people who are working. The major promise made by the Government was that social welfare increases would be paid on 1 January next year. This target will not be met and a significant number of social welfare recipients will be paid in arrears. On Committee Stage the Minister explained at great length the situation regarding categories who have books and there is no electronic transfer and the difficulty in accommodating such people within a short period of time. However, the Minister has been in office for almost four years &ndash; he will be one of the longest serving Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in the history of the State &ndash; and he should have anticipated the problems which would arise.</P>
      <P>He should also have anticipated the problems in relation to the euro element. Social welfare recipients are afraid they will suffer a double whammy on 1 January 2002 in that they will have to deal with the euro and a broken Government promise that they will not receive their increases on time. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, gave a solemn promise in his Budget Statement that social welfare recipients would receive their increases on 1 January. We know from the Secretary General of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs that the Minister has sold his clients in the social welfare system a pup and he will not deliver on his promise to pay them their increases on 1 January 2002.</P>
      <P>I am glad we have been joined by the Chairman of the Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs, the distinguished Fianna Fáil backbencher, Deputy Noel Ahern. He knows that people are disappointed that some unscrupulous people in the economy will seek to rip-off others in the changeover to the euro. Unfortunately, the Minister has admitted that social welfare recipients, who are already under pressure, will not receive their increases on time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During a previous existence I made the strong case to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, on the need to put in place within the Cabinet and in her Department and the Department of Finance structures which would prevent rip-offs during the changeover to the euro and ensure that the most vulnerable and low paid people in society would not suffer a double whammy. The Minister did not indicate in his response to the previous amendment that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is involved in this. Why is the Minister in charge of the Department which looks after people on social assistance and social insurance not aggressively involved in dealing with this issue in a Cabinet committee which includes the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and <Col N="417" /> Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance?</P>
    <P>The prevention of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease is important. My colleague, Deputy Penrose, referred to the setting up a special task force to deal with this issue. However, for many citizens what will happen on 1 January 2002 is equally important. Why has the Minister not taken it upon himself to tell the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance that he wants to ensure there are no rip-offs in the case of the people for whom he is responsible and that they are protected? The Minister admitted earlier that he has not done this. He has not acted in the way an economic Minister should act and played a role in dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the amendment. I hope the Minister, noting that he has failed to meet the target date of 1 January 2002, will do everything he can to ensure during the intervening nine months that social welfare recipients do not suffer. When will the increases in child benefit come into effect next year? Members of the Opposition were stunned to hear that the next budget will be introduced on 5 December. Why is this the case? It was indicated that the high flying mandarins in the Department of Finance, some of whom take up amazing jobs in Europe and elsewhere, put pressure on the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to introduce the budget on 5 December. As Deputy Hayes correctly said, if this is the case how will we deal with the Social Welfare Bill?</P>
    <P>The Chairman of the Select Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs probably has a view on this. Is it the case that the Government will cut and run and call a general election so that it will not have to introduce a budget later this year? It hopes it will be involved in the next Government but if it is not, so be it &ndash; if it is in Opposition it will not give a damn what happens on 1 January 2002. We are suspicious about some of the steps taken by the Minister for Finance. He looks like a guy who is clearing the decks. In this case he may be clearing the decks of the <i>Titanic</i>. Is he doing this for some ulterior purpose? I wonder whether the Minister and Government really care about the target date of 1 January 2002 as they may not be in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for his nice comments, even if I do not agree with most of his points. The one point on which I agree relates to the introduction of the budget on 5 December. Obviously there are management problems in terms of condensing the work, etc., but I thought it would have been brought forward by a few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of increases months after they were announced by the Minister in his Budget Statement used to be a burning issue. It is extra<Col N="418" /> ordinary how quickly an issue ceases to be a problem once it is solved. To be fair, the move forward in this respect started before the Minister came into office. I think the then Minister, Deputy De Rossa, or the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government started it seven or eight years ago. Prior to this the increase did not come into effect until mid-July. Ministers initially moved the date forward by one week every second year. In the past few years under this Minister the date jumped from mid-July to early July, mid-June, early June, early May, early April, while now it is January. Huge strides have been made and this is now a non-issue. Ministers only get the kudos once. The same applies to social welfare recipients who only get the benefit when the date is moved forward; they do not get the benefit on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Broughan's points on the target date of 1 January 2002. Many parents did not collect child benefit and let it accumulate for two or three months so that they could buy shoes, etc. for their children. The notion that the world will fall down if parents have to wait six weeks or two months for the increase in child benefit is nonsense. Many parents, intelligently, do not collect child benefit for one or two months so that they can accumulate enough money to buy larger items. If it is collected every week it is usually thrown in with the housekeeping money.</P>
    <P>The amendment calls on me to report on the rationale between the different commencement dates. I do not want to repeat what I have said, but it is important to again emphasis that when the Government came to office four years ago there was a huge divergence between the tax and social welfare systems.</P>
    <P>Time and again on the talk shows people complained when a budget announcement was made that tax rates could come into force reasonably quickly, with an obvious lead-in time, while the people on social welfare had to wait. This Government has endeavoured &ndash; I have played my part in pushing for it and I thank the Deputy for his remarks &ndash; to align tax and social welfare so that social welfare would be paid on the same day as the taxation rates kick in. At a cost of £85 million the payment date is being brought forward in one fell swoop from 5 April to 1 January. The Government deserves credit for endeavouring to keep the period between announcement and payment to the bare minimum. The reason the 5 December budget was chosen was that people would be paid from 1 January. At no stage have I hidden the fact that there are difficulties given the type of system in place where 600,000 of the 900,000 on social welfare have payment books. Changing books is laborious. If anyone wants to be paid his or her increase on the due date in the first week of January &ndash; there is a time span of a week or more for the different schemes to kick in &ndash; he or she has the option to go on electronic fund transfer. Obviously the main desire of people is to remain with the tried and <Col N="419" /> trusted book. Given that these books go out twice a year there is a six-month cycle. If the books were to be available for everybody on 1 January the budget announcement would have to be in July.</P>

      <P>It could have been done, but one would be accused of declaring that people are entitled to an increase in July but would not get it until 1 January. It was a political decision by the Government to bring the payments forward to 1 January. The announcement that the Government was changing the tax year from 5 April to 1 January took people by surprise as did the decision to do likewise with social welfare payments. Consequent to that decision certain changes will have to be made. The Government decided the budget would be on 5 December, that the social welfare increases would take effect from 1 January and that the vast majority, because they are paid by books, would get their increases in or around mid-February plus arrears at that time. To ensure that position is not repeated in following years the Government has decided to discuss the matter of the production of books which is subject to competition and contract, but it is its intention to invest further in the delivery of the post office book so that the lead-in time will be reduced and the bi-annual book will not cause a problem. While the Deputies on the far side make some play of the fact that people will not be paid on 1 January they will still get their full social welfare payment in mid-February including the arrears from 1 January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but he was not correct, and he would be the first to acknowledge that. When the Government decided to have the budget on 5 December the penny started to drop. Any Deputy who says we could not deliver our fifth budget is living in cloud cuckoo land. It would have been cuter perhaps to have the budget in October and we might have been able to run before the payments kicked in but the reality is that this Government will continue to the first half of 2002. It will deliver on its promise of five budgets and continue the massive increases provided in social welfare, particularly in child benefit, unless the Opposition trips it up.</P>
      <P>The social welfare increases during the Rainbow Government operated for 29 weeks out of 52 in the particular year. This Government increased the number of payment weeks by two in the first year, by four in the second year and by a further four this year. At the time of the next budget the payment weeks will be increased by 12 or 13. When this budget kicks in all the budget increases will, in effect, be given for 52 weeks of the year. Even the Opposition would have to acknowledge that that is a significant change.</P>
      <P>To bring child benefit forward in 2001 would cost £28 million for each month it is brought forward, based on the increases. Some £330 million was dedicated this year to child benefit increases and next year will be the same. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to know that if the increases are bought forward by three months it costs money. To bring them forward from June to April would cost approximately £56 million. Out of a budget of £330 million, the payments could be increased by £X but then there would not be room to bring them forward. We decided to give a massive increase, £25 a month for the first two children and £30 for the third and subsequent child, and bring forward the payments by three months, which reduces the overall figure.</P>
      <P>The Deputies are trying to get me to outline what we will introduce in terms of child benefit in the next budget. I will not do so but, apart from dedicating £330 million this year, we will invest an extra £330 million for the second year in a row in child benefit. A percentage of that will be used to bring forward the payments again if the Government takes that policy decision. We have already set out on the path of bringing forward payments from September to June and I would like us to do something similar in the next budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage, the Government has endeavoured as much as it can to rationalise the payment dates. The issue could be examined by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs. My officials are annoyed to be called mandarins. They have done good work and Deputies have <Col N="421" /> acknowledged that they are available to brief them at any time.</P>

Haughey who described the Taoiseach as the most devious and cunning of them all. The Minister should put it down to experience because he might be proved wrong on this. He may not have the inside track he thinks he has.</P>
      <P>The Minister has admitted there will be a budget on 5 December. According to the schedule of Dáil sittings for the remainder of the year, the Christmas recess begins on Friday, 14 December. The budget will be on 5 December with the usual statements and responses on 6 December and between that and 14 December the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill must be put through the House to ensure the provisions they contain can be implemented on 1 January 2002.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important. Two years ago the Government informed us it would realign the tax and social welfare codes on 1 January 2002. We applauded the Government but it is scrambling at the last minute to figure out how to process the necessary legislation through the House. It is not plausible. How can the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill pass through both Houses in that time? If we think it is bad in this House, our colleagues in the Seanad will sit on 31 December. How will this work?</P>
      <P>We have exposed the political motivation in this through our amendment to get ready for an election and hand out the goodies at any given time. That is why the Government does not want to backdate the payments to 1 January and wants to issue cheques in mid-February to clear the decks, as Deputy Broughan said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of ways to process the legislation. I fully accept Deputy Hayes's comment that it is a political decision to align the codes on 1 January because we believe that is the correct course of action but it is not a political decision to issue payments in mid-February. We will be able to say to social welfare recipients that they will get their increases over 52 weeks and not 29 weeks per year as was the case <Col N="422" /> when Fine Gael was in Government. There will be more money in their pockets. The decision to bring forward social welfare payments from 5 April to 1 January will cost £85 million and social welfare recipients, who need assistance, will gain that amount. The Government made a genuine political decision to do so.</P>
      <P>The system caters for payments to 900,000 people per week and I take my hat off to my staff who experience few problems in the delivery of payments.</P>

      <P>The change has nothing to do with an election. Irrespective of whether the budget is announced on 5 December or on an earlier date, more than 600,000 people will still not receive their increases until mid-February because of the system, as I explained on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The passing of the legislation should be the least of our worries. The primary reason we are here in terms of social welfare provision is to deliver money to recipients and to give them reasonable increases.</P>

      <P>There are a number of ways to arrange the legislative requirements to bring forward the payments. We are examining them. A short Bill to cover the intervening period may be introduced followed by a longer Bill or regulations may be introduced followed by a Bill. While Deputy Hayes thinks 900,000 social welfare recipients would be worried about whether he would have to have his Christmas dinner in the House, I do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know because it has been clear from the Minister's contributions that he does not care. For the past two years following the Government decision the Minister should have been preparing the changeover mechanism in his Department whereby the increases could be delivered to people on 1 January. It is not good enough for the Minister to come into the House to inform us he still has not worked out the mechanism to be used. He is supposed to be running a Department and keeping a keen eye on developments. There is a plethora of technology available and advances have been made but the Minister has not yet worked out how he will introduce the changes. That demonstrates gross incompetence by the head of a Department in dealing with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision was taken two years but the Minister still does not know what he is doing. The <Col N="423" /> amendment has exposed gross incompetence on the part of the Minister in terms of his management of the delivery of increases. The business to be conducted by the House between 5 December and the Christmas recess is as clear as mud because the Government has not worked out the changeover. It has not done so because it wants to keep its options open. That is why the Government has decided not to increase child benefit in the first week of April similar to every other increase. It wants windows of opportunity and privately all Government party members admit that.</P>
    <P>It is part of the Fianna Fáil cute hoorism that we normally witness approaching an election. Fianna Fáil wants different dates whereby the election can be called, whether it is the first week of April when the new social welfare increases and tax concessions come into play or 1 June when the child benefit increases come into effect. Next year people will receive a little more money in mid-February and Fianna Fáil will look upon that as another window of opportunity. This is Fianna Fáil cute hoorism at its worst. The Minister learned so well from his mentor, Mr. Haughey, through the years. I know the Minister had a strong loyalty to Mr. Haughey.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On 6 February I informed the House that the Government was considering a number of possibilities on the question of holding referenda during 2001. Matters which were considered were the Nice Treaty, the International Criminal Court, judicial oversight and-or impeachment and the removal of references to the death penalty from the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The question of whether ratification of the Treaty of Nice will require a referendum is still under consideration and the Government will take a decision when the advice of the Attorney General has been received. I hope and expect that we will soon be in a position to take that decision. However, I have asked officials to ensure that the preparatory work necessary for a referendum is put in train to give the Government the full range of options for timing. The Attorney General has advised, in relation to the International Criminal Court, that a constitutional referendum is required for Ireland to ratify the statute. The Department of Foreign Affairs is currently drafting the appropriate legislation which I hope will be published at an early date.</P>
      <P>In relation to judicial review and-or impeachment, this matter is being examined by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in light of the Report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution of November 1999 and the Report of the Committee on Judicial Conduct and Ethics of December 2000. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is also considering the issues around removal of references to the death penalty from the Constitution. Yesterday the Government approved the drafting of Bills on both these issues. The Government will decide in due course both on a specific package of measures which shall be put to the people for consideration at a referendum or referenda and on the appropriate timing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible to have a copy of the treaty and its various annexes provided for Members? I mention the annexes because I understand they provide information about evolving EU defence arrangements as well as the treaty itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the Nice Treaty will effectively remove the veto on the development of a two-tier Europe which existed under the Amsterdam Treaty? As such it will be difficult not to have a referendum on that matter from a constitutional perspective. That said, does the Taoiseach regard the time between now and <Col N="425" /> summer as adequate for a full debate on the complexities of the treaty? A White Paper was published six months before the Amsterdam Treaty to allow debate on that treaty. When does the Taoiseach see a referendum commission being put in place if there is to be a referendum on the Nice Treaty during the summer?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal texts and annexes have just been received by the Attorney General. The signing was last week and the linguistic versions were only made available then. I think they are all available but I will check and if they are there I will not have any difficulty giving them to party leaders. I presume they will be published shortly in their full form. The Attorney General is examining these matters carefully and there is a process to be followed in which they are fully examined, annotated and so on. We hope that will happen soon.</P>
      <P>On 6 February I answered Deputy Quinn regarding any doubts about this matter. I know the Tánaiste commented recently on enlargement and said we would be more focused on having a referendum than not but we must await the formal consideration of this matter by the Attorney General and his report. Those are the procedures set down and we hope it will be completed in the next few weeks. The referendum Bill would then have to be prepared and, as I said in February, we hope that can be done speedily but we will go ahead with as much other work as possible in any case. The White Paper will not take as long but work has been done on it in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>It looks fairly certain at this stage that no other country will have a referendum. The Swedish Prime Minister told me last week that most of them have already voted on this in their national parliaments and only a few remain. It would not then be a good idea for us to delay this unduly. I will do my utmost through the referendum commission, through the Bill itself and through the White Paper to deal with this as quickly as possible. I still intend to deal with it by the summer if that can be achieved.</P>

      <P>There is still some confusion as to whether a referendum on Nice will be afforded the people and from the Taoiseach's response it is clear that the Government is considering putting several issues before the people on that day. Can the Taoiseach confirm that this is what he is considering &ndash; a multi-referenda situation in the event of the Nice Treaty being put before the people? What would the questions be? Does the Taoiseach not agree that holding multi-referenda is a recipe for disaster, as was demonstrated in the past? The Amsterdam Treaty was taken along with the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement, which was most unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Taoiseach's position on the question posed by the EU Commission President, Mr. Romano Prodi, in the European Parliament on 13 February when he asked if we were all clear <Col N="426" /> that we wanted to build something that can aspire to world power status?</P>
    <P>My response to that is a clear and emphatic &ldquo;no&rdquo; and that would be the position of my party. Does the Taoiseach share Mr. Prodi's sentiments?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will restate the position since Deputy Ó Caoláin thinks it is not clear. The final text of the Nice Treaty, the jurists' translations and versions of that, with the annexes, have just been received by the Attorney General following the signing last Monday week in Nice by the Foreign Affairs Ministers. They will be examined by the Attorney General under the normal procedures. He will draft a legal opinion and the Government will have to make a decision.</P>
      <P>I have outlined my views on the principle of enlargement on several occasions, including in March and October last year. The people of this country should have an opportunity to give their views on it. I believe they will be supportive of enlargement which is, effectively, what the Nice Treaty is about. It is about allowing the enlargement discussions to be finalised, hopefully in time for new countries to enter on 1 January 2004 or earlier, for the system to take account of them and for the mechanisms of the Community and other international bodies to deal with them. On that basis, I would confidently put it to the people in a referendum so they, too, can show their support for enlargement.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence that Irish people get confused by multi referenda. Deputy Lenihan and Deputy O'Keeffe have been urging&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes. I do not anticipate any difficulty in that regard. In fairness to the all-party committee on the Constitution, it has produced an enormous amount of work which probably requires some tidying up. There is an ongoing examination of how that can be done with regard to a number of issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, effectively, four issues being considered for this referendum. One is the Nice Treaty, which is a straightforward issue. There is also the issue regarding the judicial conduct and ethics report and the all-party committee on the Constitution's report on judicial ethics some time ago. We have received Justice Susan Denham's report that the issue should be dealt with. There is also the commitment we have had for many years &ndash; I believe Deputy Spring made it initially &ndash; to remove hanging from the Constitution. The <Col N="427" /> former Minister, Deputy Andrews, brought that forward and the work has to be completed. Finally, the international court issue is outstanding. It should have been passed before the end of December. We are not alone in that regard, however, because many other countries have not passed it yet. These four issues are urgent and we have given commitments on them. I do not believe there will be confusion in putting any or all of them to the people.</P>

Following examination of the Green Paper by the all-party comittee and its report, the Cabinet sub-committee has had a number of meetings &ndash; it met this morning, incidentally &ndash; and it has still to conclude its deliberations. The commitment I gave to the House was that if there is an amendment and legislation in that area &ndash; my personal view on the issue has been well documented for many years &ndash; there will be a separate referendum. Until there is a conclusion of the work of the Cabinet sub-committee, however, there will be no decision on it.</P>

      <P>In relation to the proposed judicial council, will the Taoiseach clarify whether he is accepting the recommendation of the all-party committee for a constitutional referendum to establish such a council with lay participation on the council or is he accepting the recent report of the judges committee, chaired by the Chief Justice, which proposes the establishment of a judicial council composed only of judges and which, according to the report, would not require a referendum?</P>

      <P>There is a range of other issues. We have been looking at the possibility and the legality &ndash; something on which I do not claim to be an expert &ndash; of having an omnibus referendum on a number of them. The difficulty is, to refer back to Deputy Ó Caoláin's remarks, that one runs the risk of confusion if a number of items are grouped. In one of the committee's reports alone there might be 15 or 16 proposed amendments. I am not saying they are not all necessary; most of them are. I have given each of the committee's reports to each Department for thorough examination and, where possible and necessary, asked them to bring forward legislation.</P>

        <b>:</b> The Nice Treaty has serious implications for the people of this State, not least of which is the context in which certain European powers and those in the European bureaucracy see the future in terms of the creation of an economic super power with a military wing which will rival the US. In view of the serious implications, what timescale does the Taoiseach envisage allowing for the national debate which should take place?</P>

      <Col N="429" /> The Taoiseach has stated that the Government has not decided whether to hold a referendum but it has put in place provisions in case such a referendum is held.

Will the Taoiseach be specific, not on the exact date but on whether the referendum will be held before the summer recess?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree in principle that when important issues such as the Nice Treaty are to be debated in the lead-up to a referendum, the vote should not be tied in with general or local elections? I am not asking the Taoiseach to give a date for the general election.

It is also about the size of the Parliament, how Commissions will be formed, the weighting of votes, qualified majority and those countries who wish to move on and enhance co-operation.

As he did not answer in the first instance, will the Taoiseach state his opinion of, position on and answer to the European Commission president, Mr. Romano Prodi, who clearly stated on 13 February that that is the purpose and intent he and his colleagues have, and that Nice is part of that whole programme? Nice concerns more than EU expansion, and that difference is clearly between us. Does the Taoiseach agree that the Commission's recent rebuke regarding the budget demonstrates a need for caution in order not to further diminish our sovereignty and our control of our own economy, which will undoubtedly flow from the ratification of the Nice Treaty? Does the Taoiseach accept that there are serious consequences for Ireland in the ratification of the Nice Treaty and the programme which the Taoiseach is clearly recommending should continue? </P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like or understand the kind of independence attitude the Deputy is putting forward. The concept of Romano Prodi, or any of the other leaders, has been to make Europe a strong economic bloc that would help to give its citizens more freedom, improved services, better livelihoods and less unemployment. That concept seeks to deal with the problems of the 15 million people who are still unemployed in the EU. It also seeks to ensure that the single currency will have a strong and significant influence against the yen and US dollar zones. That is a noble objective and one to which I totally subscribe.</P>
      <P>The enlargement process is doing no more than giving people who are either in economic difficulty or in less advanced stages of economic development, the opportunity that we got a generation ago. I do not see anything wrong with ceding some sovereignty and some power, while seeking co-operation and compromise in order to achieve that. It is right to do so. As I have said on the record of the House many times, I do not accept that one can expect to go from 15 EU members states to 27 or 28 without making changes in an evolving situation. I disagree with the Deputy's view, if it really is his view. He raised the point as a question so perhaps it is not his view. The Treaty of Nice is worthy of support and that is why people in all other countries have wholeheartedly supported it, without any great debate in national parliaments.</P>

      <P>I am not aware the discussion has taken place in all other countries, but I am open to correction. The Taoiseach might indicate those countries in which the discussion has taken place. Will the Government take into account the opinion that might be expressed by the European Parliament and would that affect the timing of any referendum?</P>
      <P>My second question arises from the Taoiseach's repeated answers to Parliamentary Questions and supplementary questions in which he has suggested that the form of words to be put to the public will ask their opinion on enlargement. This does not fit easily with his previous statement that the Attorney General is providing a legal opinion to the Government. I imagine the legal opinion will deal with the institutional changes arising from Nice. Therefore, are we to have the referendum &ndash; if it should happen &ndash; on a consultative basis on the issue of enlargement, or will it be on the totality of the treaty? On the one hand, it is the Attorney General's role to prepare an opinion on the implications of the totality of the treaty in an institutional sense. That is one form of consultative referendum, although another may be necessary if the Attorney General decides it may be required legally. If the referendum is simply consultative and the Taoiseach is asking whether the public is in favour of enlargement or against it, it becomes merely rhetorical. Either way, in so far as the European Parliament is an institution affected by the changes proposed in the text of the treaty, would it not be valuable to await the opinion of the European Parliament in deciding what it was that the Taoiseach asked his Attorney General to advise him on?</P>

      <P>From what the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, have said, it seems the Government has clearly decided there will be a referendum irrespective of what the legal advice may be. As my colleague, Deputy Higgins, has just intimated, however, the legal advice could influence the form of the referendum. Having regard to his replies to Deputy Sargent and others, does the Taoiseach think it is desirable that a decision on this matter, including a referendum, should take place before the end of the summer session? If so, taking the four months that Deputy Higgins referred to, we really need to obtain a clear timetable from the Government that will allow for a proper debate.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the legal framework within which we all must act following the McKenna and Coughlan judgments, is it the Government's intention to publish a White Paper that would not only illustrate the content of the Nice Treaty &ndash; which may not legally require a referendum to have it endorsed &ndash; but also the Government's own position on enlargement, and address what has become known as the finality debate? What is the end configuration of an enlarged European Union? Does the Government have a view on that and will that view be communicated so that when people are being asked to vote for enlargement, for the first time since the Treaty of Rome, they would not be confronted with the &ldquo;ever closer union&rdquo; mantra, but would be given a description of what the end configuration of the European Union might be? In that way, they can have a clear idea as to the extent of the enlarged union in the end.</P>

      <P>The question of how the Union should evolve will be discussed when the next Intergovernmental Conference takes place in 2004. The debate in this regard is already taking the interest of academics and I do not doubt that it will enter the political arena in a year or two. Our views on this matter will be outlined in the White Paper.</P>

      <P>My view is clear. After the enlargement process is finished there will be 28 member states. This is unlikely to change. There is a view abroad that this will be the position in 2020. However, I do not believe matters will end there because one can see the various blocs and groupings forming already. In 25 years' time there will probably be a different configuration. Academics, as opposed to politicians, are already considering the new frontiers. On many occasions at ECOFIN Council meetings when the question of frontiers was discussed, I informed Jacques Chirac &ndash; I have since reiterated my views to Romano Prodi &ndash; that it would be good if people indicated what they consider Europe to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Views expressed in academic debates are a different matter. It is known, for example, that Mr. Putin, given that he is from St. Petersburg, considers himself to be a European and many of <Col N="437" /> his recent speeches have dealt with that matter. If account is taken of the relationship between the north African states and Europe, it is obvious that matters will continue to evolve. However, setting down our current position &ndash; which will probably apply to this generation and, perhaps, the next &ndash; is an easy thing to do.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he will implement the Blackstock reports on the funding of secondary schools, which were published by his Department in August 1998 and June 1999.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6919/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): As the Deputy is aware, the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools, that had available to it the report of a technical working group, represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post primary schools and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach. The recommendations made in the steering group's report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under continuing review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am aware of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, and I intend to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this aspect of the funding of schools.</P>
    <P>I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. The introduction of this support fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. In addition, schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and <Col N="438" /> a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information.</i>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources. I assure the Deputy that it is my intention that the recommendations of the steering group report on the funding of second level schools will inform policy on future school funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a number of supplementaries and I will attempt to be brief. Did I understand the Minister to say that reports published in August 1998 and June 1999 dealing with the lack of equity in funding for proposed primary schools are still under review in his Department? The Minister went on to refer to the school services support fund. Does he accept that, while this fund is welcome, it does not bridge the gap to bring about equity and that it further perpetuates it because it does not level the playing pitch in terms of the funding available to Catholic post-primary schools as opposed to what is available to community comprehensive schools? Does he accept that a core finding of the Blackstock report is that Catholic post-primary schools receive 25% less funding per pupil relative to community and comprehensive schools and 12% less than vocational schools, and that nothing other than an immediate recognition of that and a bridging of the gap in terms of funding to be provided will resolve this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>To complete my reply, I assure the Deputy that it is my intention that the recommendations of the steering group on the funding of second level schools will inform policy on future school funding. We are continuing to bring about a situation where the requirements are met.</P>
      <P>The way in which the resources are provided to second level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational and community schools. That is something which is obviously historical and which has developed over generations. In effect what we are doing is working towards bringing about much greater unity in this area and the school enrolments were seen in the Blackstock report as being the principal driver of school funding for all schools at second level. We are working on that basis and that is why we have increased the capitation grant and introduced a mechanism to increase the support in a supplementary way, which is what Blackstock recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that an across the board increase in capitation does not deal with the inequity and while that increase is <Col N="439" /> welcome, it does not deal with the discrimination that still exists and which was identified in stark terms in the Blackstock report?</P>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to three specific issues. On the cost of insurance, the Department pays directly the cost of school insurance which, for a 500 pupil school, can be approximately £10,000 per annum for community and comprehensive schools, yet the Catholic voluntary schools have to pay this directly out of their capitation. Another area of discrimination is the provision of caretakers and secretaries. A 500 pupil community school will have one full-time secretary who is paid directly by the Department, yet the voluntary sector has to pay that money out of its allocation because the level of assistance it receives is only £10,000. In the area of cleaning and repairs, a direct grant is provided by the Department but no such provision is made for the voluntary school sector. When will the Minister implement the findings of the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the process of implementing them. We have provided considerable additional funds and we will continue to do so. I meant to congratulate Deputy Creed on becoming spokesman on education for the main Opposition party. I wish him the best in the post. There is discretion in terms of the support fund in that not alone can it be provided for caretakers and secretaries but it can be allocated elsewhere if they so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Quest>if, in view of the recent report on the high non-completion rates within the universities and the indications of even higher such rates within the institutes of technology, he will give urgent attention to restoring the 1:250 ratio for career guidance counsellors which obtained in the early 1980s; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7189/01]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In the current school year the allocation to second level schools in respect of guidance and counselling is of the order of 580 whole-time teacher equivalents. I recently announced that 50 additional posts for guidance and counselling will be allocated to second level schools to develop innovative ways of enhancing guidance for students and to promote links between schools, business, voluntary and State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the current availability of guidance services, I have recently received the results of an audit of all second level schools, conducted on behalf of my Department by the National Centre for Guidance in Education. It is clear <Col N="440" /> from the audit that a significant number of schools are not fully utilising the resources currently being made available to them by my Department for guidance and that, in many schools, the service is not adequately targeted at pupils at risk.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, my first priority is to ensure the resources made available to schools for guidance are fully utilised for that purpose. In line with the Government's priority to promote social inclusion, my other priority is to ensure that those young people who are most at risk of dropping out of education early are a major focus of guidance provision in schools. As a result, any future enhancement of provision to individual schools will be conditional on their making a commitment to providing a service to all their pupils which would reflect both Government priorities and their pupils' needs.</P>
    <P>An expert group on teacher allocations at second level is currently examining all aspects of the teacher allocation process at second level, including the provision of staffing resources to schools for guidance. The question of increasing the allocation in respect of guidance and counselling will be considered in the light of the recommendations of the group, which are expected in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply indicating his view of the career guidance service is extraordinary. Does he agree it is somewhat different from what most people have of that service? This has always been regarded as a mainstream service which should be available for all second level pupils given that all second level pupils need career guidance. Is the Minister now targeting this service at at-risk pupils because that seems to be the implication of his reply? I would bring the Minister back to the original question. Clearly, and for a number of reasons, not least the high drop-out rate from third level colleges, there is an inadequacy in the current provision of career guidance within second level schools. Does the Minister accept that? Does he accept that we need to move rapidly back to the position that obtained in the early 1980s when there was one career guidance counsellor to every 250 pupils? The ratio is currently 1:500, a doubling of the ratio. Is the Minister committed to following through on the promise given before the last election in his own party's manifesto to restore that 1:250 ratio? What kind of timescale has he got in mind to do this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that I recently allocated an additional 50 posts for guidance and counselling. Therefore, in relation to inadequate provision, that is an additional 50 guidance counsellors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the audit has shown that certain students are not getting the support they should <Col N="441" /> get, it will be done in a more targeted way. That is what we want to do and I am sure it is what the Deputy would want to do.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned achieving a ratio of 1:250 pupils. We have allocated an additional 50 posts which will help in that regard. One feature which has been missed in the discussions about the ratio is that when the ratio was 1:250, schools with under 250 pupils received no allocation. That is not the best situation. We are trying to cover small schools at the same time. I know that will make it more difficult to achieve the target, but that is the other element involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister see access to career guidance as being a mainstream service to which all mainstream students are entitled?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the specific issue raised by the Deputy, I want to briefly say that the position on the ASTI dispute is that the Labour Court was asked by the Labour Relations Commission at the end of January to hear the issues in this dispute, acting on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. The court held a formal meeting on 7 February at which it received both written and oral submissions from the ASTI and from the Departments of Education and Science, and Finance. The court's examination of the issues in dispute is nearing completion. I do not think that further public debate or comment on the issues by the parties to the dispute, while the matter is being <Col N="442" /> considered by the Labour Court, would be helpful.</P>
      <P>All parties should await the outcome of the Labour Court's examination and give full consideration to its recommendations when they are received. I am sure everyone will agree that this is the best way forward in seeking a resolution of this difficult dispute and ensuring that schools will be able to operate as normal and that the certificate examinations will not be affected in any way.</P>
      <P>I have already made it clear in this House and I avail of this opportunity to assure the Deputy and all students and their parents that the 2001 certificate examinations will proceed without any diminution in either the integrity or validity. As I have already indicated the results may issue a little later than usual. There may be some unavoidable delay in the case of the junior certificate. The priority will be to ensure that standards are maintained. It is essential that the high reputation enjoyed by our public examinations continues and that public confidence in the examination system is preserved.</P>
      <P>Regarding contingency arrangements, I have already made it clear that I consider it incumbent on me as Minister to safeguard the examinations, and to that end I have had my Department continue to develop contingency plans for conducting and marking the examinations, having regard to the necessity of maintaining a quality approach to the marking process. It would be inappropriate to make further comment on this matter while the Labour Court process continues.</P>
      <P>I emphasise to the House that a resolution of the dispute remains my top priority. Preparation of alternative arrangements is simply prudent in the interests of the students. It is my sincere hope that there can be a resolution of the dispute through the work of the Labour Court and that there will be no need to activate the contingency plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's hope that the Labour Court will bridge the gap and bring about a favourable resolution. It is important to give a signal to the thousands of pupils and their parents who are waiting anxiously that, notwithstanding what may come to pass, the examinations will proceed uninterrupted. The Minister's reluctance or failure to roll out his contingency plan does not give credence to his claim that he can guarantee that they will proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will not the Minister accept these shortcomings, if they emerge, will be devastating for the credibility and currency which the leaving certificate has had for years? Do the Department's efforts in putting together a contingency plan involve recruitment of retired staff? I know of an 89 years old gentleman who has been asked to correct leaving certificate Irish examination papers. I do not want to be accused of ageism but it is not possible to save the examinations' integrity if that is the fall-back position. The Minister must give us an outline of the steps his Department has taken. It has been flagged for six months. The <Col N="443" /> Minister must be able to give us a broad outline, notwithstanding the hope that the Labour Court will bridge the gap.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is important to give a clear signal to parents. I have repeatedly done that and given my commitment that we will do everything in our power to have the exams held. Last October I began the preparations just in case as this was a matter of prudence. It was incumbent on me to make what arrangements I could. My Department assures me that the exams can be run and I am happy that the assurance is based on reality. A great deal of work has gone into this. Of course it will be difficult. We do not want to be involved in this.</P>
      <P>I am unaware of the case the Deputy mentioned of an 89 years old gentleman. The Deputy says he does not want to be involved in ageism, but that is ageism. As soon as he mentioned that, it was ageism. He cannot pull it back now unless he asks for it to be withdrawn from the record.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the number of legal challenges taken against the State since 1993, alleging failure of the State to comply with the terms of the 1993 Supreme Court ruling in the O'Donoghue case; the reason the State is appealing a High Court ruling in the Sinnott case; the amount of money paid by the State, both in defending these cases and in legal compensation where cases have been conceded or lost; and the estimated costs of complying in full with the court ruling in an organised and structured fashion.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I say at the outset that the State fully complied with the High Court judgment in the O'Donoghue case and did so without any delay following delivery of the judgment. The Deputy's question may relate to cases involving similar issues as arose in the O'Donoghue case. Since the High Court judgment in that case, a total of 117 legal actions have been taken against the State on behalf of children with special needs in which the judgment in question has been cited. The cases in question are at various stages. Many have been adjourned generally on the basis that provision has now been put in place.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am constrained in commenting specifically on the second case to which he refers as this matter is currently under appeal. The High Court judgment in this case raises issues which are of such fundamental importance to the education system, and to the system of State administration and expenditure, that they require clarification by the Supreme Court. The Government considers that it has an obligation, in the public interest, to clarify these matters and establish precisely what is the range of the State's duty in this area. The appeal will focus on legal and constitutional issues. It will not affect damages which have already been paid to Mrs. Sinnott in respect of past education of her son or expenses for his education pending the judgment of the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>To date, the cases taken against the State on foot of the O'Donoghue judgment have involved the State in expenditure of £1million in meeting claimants' legal fees and £1.68 million in agreed damages and settlements. The O'Donoghue case related to the provision of education services for children with severe or profound general learning disability. The estimated cost of provision for these children is £7 million per annum compared to a cost of approximately £5 million per annum for children with autism. All such children are entitled to avail of the special school transport service and to be accompanied by an escort on this service. Additional provision is being put in place in both of these areas on an ongoing basis as further needs are identified.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that I find it unacceptable that any parent, particularly a parent of a child with special needs, should find it necessary to resort to litigation to secure their child's educational entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>While this Government has presided over an unprecedented level of improvement in special <Col N="445" /> education services, I am fully aware that much work remains to be done. A key development in this regard is the recent report of the planning group established in my Department to make recommendations on the arrangements which should be put in place to ensure the most effective provision of a high quality co-ordinated service at all stages of education for students with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The recommendations brought forward by the planning group provide a valuable blueprint for the development of an efficient and effective special education service which will remove the need for parents to have to resort to litigation to secure their entitlements. The recommendations have been endorsed by the Cromien review of the Department's operations, systems and staffing needs. It is my intention to seek Government approval to implement recommendations of the Cromien report and the special education planning group with a view to improving the delivery of services to parents and children including those with special needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it strange that the Minister made a statement today on the Sinnott case. Of 117 cases taken so far, quite a few have been settled or withdrawn. This is the only way families can ensure they receive their entitlements following the O'Donoghue case. They have to go through legal channels so the Minister and his Department give them these entitlements. I wonder if the Sinnott case and its appeal by the State are about finance and the money allocated to the Sinnott family in the High Court. The Minister, by appealing this case, hopes the court will reduce the award. Considering what the Sinnotts and other families have tolerated, including the State's failure to provide a proper education, I think the Minister's action is criminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Farrelly refers to my statement which states:</P>
      <P>I have a duty and a responsibility to invite the Supreme Court to decide on the constitutionality of certain aspects of the High Court judgment on the Jamie Sinnott. The appeal will not affect the damages or awards which have been paid to Jamie Sinnott or to his mother, Mrs. Catherine Sinnott. In addition, and unusually, the Government will pay all of Mrs. Sinnott's High Court costs, and her Supreme Court costs, no matter what the outcome. I am appealing the High Court decision to the Supreme Court to clarify points of constitutional law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of this case means that the issues are quite extensive and, therefore, I cannot go into it in any great detail. Certain elements of the judgment in the Sinnott case raise issues of such fundamental importance to education and the administration of the State that they require clarification by the Supreme Court. Based on legal advice received, the Government considers that <Col N="446" /> it has an obligation to clarify these matters and establish precisely the range of the State's duty. Jamie Sinnott is receiving the support and education requested by his mother and I have given assurance that that will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>Other cases have been dropped, or other people have stepped back from them. This results from the action plan I published following the Sinnott case involving a number of the things parents were seeking, including pre-school starting at three years of age. A total of 78 classes have been established, as people sought. We are developing a nationwide pre-school service for children with autism, starting at the age of three. Special needs assistant support is to be doubled from one to two in all classes of children with autism. Educational services for such children will be extended into the month of July. Funding of £5.5 million is involved in the package. There is no question of it not going ahead; nor is there a question of Jamie Sinnott being denied his entitlements. There are, however, legal questions which need to be sorted out. The court said that its findings could be applied to any person, which may not be what Deputy Farrelly has in mind.</P>

      <Quest>if he has taken action following the completion by the action group on access to third level education of its report; the plans he has to implement its recommendations; and if he will substantially increase third level maintenance grants to students and bring qualifying income limits to realistic levels.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appointed an action group on access to third level education last September to consider the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access by students from three target groups. The group was asked to advise on specific interventions which would be most effective in making further progress. I have received the report of the action group and I compliment the members of the group and their chairman, Dr. Cormac McNamara, on producing the report within a relatively short period of time. I am considering their recommendations and hope to make an initial response in the near future.</P>
      <P>To indicate the Government's support of equity in access, a special maintenance grant is now payable to disadvantaged grant holders, targeted at those most in need. This was announced last September as an initial step, pending the findings of the action group. The full rates of the special maintenance grant entail increases over standard rates, from £1,775 to £2,000 for students residing more than 15 miles from college and from £710 to £1,000 for students resident within 15 miles. Recommendations relating to criteria for the special maintenance grant, and the rates to apply, form part of the action group's report.</P>
      <P>I also announced last November that I was setting up a special project team to carry out a review of every aspect of the maintenance grants, and other student supports, to ensure their relevance to the needs of third level students. This review will include the level of grants, the methods by which they are paid, eligibility and income limits, accommodation needs, student support services, the most suitable paying agency, the provision of an appeals system, student loans and taxation measures. Issues relating to the implementation of the team's recommendations will be addressed when its report has been completed.</P>

The Minister's reply shows he has no plans to change rules of access from the current inequitable situation, despite the fact that he has received the report and is aware of the situation prior to it. Many young people apply for admission to third level institutions at this time of the year. The Government has failed to do two things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate that maintenance grants will be substantially <Col N="448" /> improved in the coming year? That indication has to come now, as young people have applied to college, but are not enthusiastic about the application due to financial difficulties. A recent ESRI report indicates that we will need 350,000 people in the coming years, most of whom will have to be skilled, but what chance of becoming skilled have the students who are now entering? An initial excess is not an indicator of the outcome. The question is whether they will qualify and not drop out as happens so frequently, and that is linked to the total inadequacy of maintenance grants. Increasing them from £1,700 to £2,000 is absolutely ridiculous.</P>

The initial increase I gave came out of last year's funds because no fund had been allocated &ndash; I came in after that. I made an allocation when this was being set up in September last. We are directing a good deal of extra funding towards the disadvantaged because, as the various surveys show, they are people who are not getting into further and higher education. They are also the people who have difficulty when they are there. That aspect will certainly receive attention.</P>

      <P>Teachers in second level schools are employed by the authorities of the schools concerned. In the case of secondary, community and comprehensive schools, the relevant school authority notifies my Department of the names of new appointees so that their names can be included in the appropriate teachers payroll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of vocational teachers, the vocational education committee concerned noti<Col N="449" /> fies my Department of the names of the teachers appointed. However, payment of the teachers is a matter for the VEC.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have details of the number of qualified second level teachers who are leaving the profession to pursue other career options. Except in the case of a teacher retiring or a teacher going on approved leave &ndash; career break, secondments or study leave &ndash; school authorities are not required to indicate why a teacher is vacating his or her position in the school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Department has the facility to track these developments it would be a useful exercise. There is ample anecdotal evidence that a considerable number of teachers are dissatisfied with their career prospects. Many are voting with their feet, particularly science and mathematics graduates, and after a number of years in the classroom, they are pursuing alternative career options. In a couple of years' time, when subject choices are being restricted in schools because of the unavailability of teachers, it will not be as easy to bring in teachers from other parts of the world as it was to bring in nurses from the Philippines. The Minister would do well to take cognisance of this issue in the context of the current dispute with teachers in the ASTI. In that regard, is the Minister amenable to establishing a commission on teaching, similar to the commission on nursing, to look at the broader issues surrounding the profession, career options, promotion opportunities, the length of the pay scale and so on. A commission could put all these issues into the melting pot and come up with solutions to problems that are of concern to many teachers and which are not specifically under the microscope of the Labour Court at present.</P>

I hope we will be able to proceed along those lines in the very near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 66 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Task Force on Dyslexia commenced its work in October 2000. At the time of its establishment, I requested the task force to make every effort to report to me within a three month period. I understand the task force is arranging to hold its final meeting on 20 March and that it expects to present its report to me shortly thereafter. It is my intention to arrange to make the report publicly available as quickly as possible after it is received. Given the complexity of the issues with which the task force was required to deal and that <Col N="451" /> it received a total of 396 written and 896 oral submissions, I am satisfied it is making satisfactory progress and I look forward to receiving its report shortly.</P>
    <P>My Department does not have precise details of the number of children and adults who need special education for dyslexia. An important consideration in this regard is the criteria used for identifying the dyslexic condition. I understand this is one of the matters being addressed by the task force and I look forward to receiving its proposals in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that approximately 1,200 submissions is a staggering figure and that it reflects the widespread concern in the community, particularly among parents of primary school pupils, about the inadequacy of the education system to deal with learning difficulties? What provision is being made in terms of teacher training to ensure teachers are adequately qualified from day one to deal with children who present with learning difficulties, particularly dyslexia? Will the Minister address the issue of access to in-service training for teachers, particularly remedial-resource teachers, who are being asked to take up positions which require specific skills for which they have not been trained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the response is wide and that it indicates a much higher interest in the issue than people might have anticipated. One of the reasons I set up the task force was to ascertain the problems not only in regard to dyslexia but also in regard to learning difficulties. Leaving aside the problem with definition, with which the Deputy is familiar, there is an area which is causing much frustration for children not only at primary level but up along the system. The number of submissions is huge and while this has delayed the work of the task force the report will be published as soon as possible. I do not have information on teacher training, but in-service training is an area which certainly needs attention.</P>

        <b>:</b> Has the task force been in contact with the Warrickshire treatment centre which is dealing with a new programme which arose from the experience of astronauts and which relates to ear balance? This centre is backed by a millionaire whose daughter is dyslexic. In reply to my written parliamentary question the Minister said the Department had been in touch with the centre. I am interested in whether the task force was in touch with it as the report states that 97% of the people involved have made a significant advancement. This is a major achievement. The treatment has not been conclusively proven but Professor Reynolds, whose ancestors I am sure came from County Leitrim, is carrying out an assessment on the success of the treatment. We thought that dyslexia was a reading disorder and the discovery that it <Col N="452" /> may be due to a physical disorder is a major breakthrough.</P>

The task force is doing only a snap-shop at present. When a group is asked to do a job within three months it can only pull together what it can. The study being carried out by Dr. Reynolds might be valuable but it will not be available for some time. The task force is trying to pull together the information which is available and to give us the best possible advice so we can take action.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he does not have figures on the number of people with dyslexia. I am sure he will agree that this is another indication of the information deficit within his Department. Was it part of the remit of the task force to establish the figures? Unless one can quantify the scale of the need one cannot put forward proposals for an adequate response.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the work of the task force is on target. The Minister cannot give specific dates, but does he intend to introduce a number of the task force's recommendations in time for the new school year in September? Does he intend to alter the unsatisfactory arrangements for people with dyslexia who will sit State examinations this year?</P>

      <P>This entire area needs to be examined and in setting up the task force I have inadvertently highlighted the issue, which has turned out to be much bigger than anticipated.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has not issued directions to schools in relation to access to information about the progress of individual children in situations where their parents may not be living together as the particular arrangements applying can vary so widely from case to case.</P>
      <P>The policy, with regard to separated parents, is that both parents are encouraged to take an active interest in their children's education and it is to the benefit of the children and the school when they do. I appreciate that practical difficulties for schools can arise where parents are separated. However, the general principle still holds in such a situation and schools should make all reasonable efforts to ensure that any report or notice which is sent by the school to one parent is also sent to the other parent at the same time. Circumstances which would justify departure from this general approach would rarely occur and would usually arise only in the context of an appropriate Court Order relating to matters of access and custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he has not issued any directive but it is clear what the policy position is that he expects schools to enunciate and implement. I put it to the Minister that it would be worthwhile for his Department to issue a directive to all schools outlining the right of both parents to obtain information about the well being of that child in the care of that school. At a time when marriage breakdown is increasing and parents are separated there is a necessity for the school to inform both parents of not only the well being of the child but of school days, parents days, First Communion, Confirmation and so on. The Minister should be more pro-active in terms of delivering this directive to schools. Some schools operate a system of informing both parents while others do not. A uniform approach is needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look at the position in relation to guidelines. These guidelines cannot be imposed straight across the board because in many cases the court will have made a judgment. It may be for the protection of a child. I have had <Col N="455" /> a case where the court insisted that no information be given to one parent. They are the exceptions but they need to be covered in any guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The question refers specifically to a case where a joint custody order has been granted by the courts. The reality is that joint custody is what the majority of persons arrive at in the event of marriage breakdown. There are many parents, men specifically, who are excluded from the educational development of their child and they resent it. They want the Department to take a firm stance on this because they have as much right to be involved in the educational development of their child as other parents. The Minister must be pro-active in this area. Will he circulate guidelines in a more coherent way to all schools to ensure clarity in this matter once and for all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of cases have arisen. I said earlier I would look at the guidelines and how they should apply. There have been a number of cases recently where directions have been given to schools, for example, by a VEC to a particular VEC school from the board to supply all information to both parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a growing problem. We have all had complaints where one or other parent has not been provided with access to information about their child in school. It is not adequate to speak about individual schools and what has happened in individual cases. There is an onus on the Minister to issue clear guidelines to all schools in respect of accessing information by both parents. Will he undertake to issue those guidelines within the next few weeks to clarify the matter for schools.</P>

I shall not rehearse all the arguments raised before lunch. This is an important amendment and I put it to the Minister that, like his colleagues on the other side of the Irish Sea who operate a policy whereby an announcement is made to increase payments and it is done in the next number of <Col N="457" /> days, we should move to that position.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the increases granted to unemployment benefit recipients, having regard to the impact of such increases on:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)the local authority differential rent scheme, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)the rental subsidy scheme for private accommodation.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments were also tabled on Committee Stage. The Minister conceded local authority tenants had difficulties when they received a modest increase in their social welfare payments because it was hoovered up by the local authority under the differential rent scheme. This also applies in respect of the operation of the health board rent subsidy where increases given to social welfare recipients are clawed back.</P>
      <P>This highlights a general problem in the social welfare system. When small increases are given, there is a tendency for another agency of the State to claim some of the increases. The objective of amendment No. 9 is to highlight this loophole and to request the Minister and his Department to be proactive with their colleagues in the Department of the Environment and Local Government to iron out these difficulties, particularly in the context of the housing issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty with the differential rent scheme is that it is not uniform throughout the country. Each local authority operates a different version of the scheme even though guidelines have been laid down. Sometimes when people obtain a small increase their rent is increased and they do not benefit. The Minister should also be proactive in regard to the rent subsidy scheme. His Department allocates considerable sums to health boards to administer the scheme. More than £110 million is invested in it. However, the money is wasted because it goes directly into the pockets of landlords who are provided with a rent subsidy. These anomalies must be ironed out. I ask the Minister to introduce a reporting mechanism whereby we can get to the root of this problem <Col N="458" /> and iron out difficulties where small increases are given to people but are then clawed back by other agencies. These amendments are necessary and I hope the Minister will adopt them.</P>
    <P>There is no point in giving small increases, such as £8 or £9 per week, under these schemes only to find they have been eaten up by other agencies. That further marginalises people who are on low incomes and they are not encouraged to fully participate in society. It is one of the hidden poverty traps that exists within social services, whether in housing or in the social welfare system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my Fine Gael colleagues. There has been a catch 22 situation for many years in regard to the operation of differential rent schemes. In some local authorities, such as my own, there is a clear rule that 15% of any increase is the maximum that can be claimed back under the scheme.</P>
      <P>All local authorities are drafting their strategic housing plans in compliance with the new planning Act. The private rented sector is a source of profound concern. Rents of £1,000 per month are common in my constituency and young people are in a terrible catch 22 situation because their income is primarily expended on rent and their ultimate aim of owning a house must be put on the back burner. Many people who are offered housing find that much of their rent supplement is clawed back or is set well below the rent of the house.</P>
      <P>I apologise for not being present to move amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 8. I was at a meeting with the Carer's Association and the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland. Representatives of both associations are in the House and are interested in a number of the amendments. They want the amendments tabled by Deputy Hayes and myself to be moved successfully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, this issue arises for people on rent and mortgage interest supplement who get an increase in the budget that is greater than the standard increase in supplementary welfare allowance rates, as has been the case with pensions in recent years following the greater increases than normal. For example, in April single pensioners will get an increase of £10 per week as opposed to the standard increase of £8 whereas couples of pension age will get £25 per week as of 5 April as opposed to the standard increase of £15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, up to now pensioners who were on the SWA rent or mortgage interest supplement did not get the benefit of the additional increase as it was automatically clawed back by way of a reduction in their SWA supplement. I do not know whether the Deputies are aware that as part of the budget package I announced that the first £5 of the additional increases in social welfare <Col N="459" /> pensions will be disregarded for the purposes of rent and mortgage interest supplement. As a result, instead of a reduction of £2 per week in their rent and mortgage interest supplement, single pensioners will receive an increase of £3 per week and will, therefore, be £13 better off per week. Instead of a reduction of £10 per week in their rent and mortgage interest supplement, couples of pension age will lose £5 per week so that overall they will be £20 per week better off.</P>
    <P>This applies to only some payments. People in receipt of the one parent family allowance, unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and payments under other schemes are not affected by the clawback of budget increases. The rate of rent and mortgage supplement will not be affected where the weekly payment increases rise by £8 for a single person and £15 per couple. The operation of the clawback will be examined again in the fundamental review of the SWA which is under way.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware in regard to the differential rent schemes that each local authority has direct responsibility for setting its own scheme subject only to the broad guidelines laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. They will also be aware that local authorities, in excluding any social welfare increase from rent assessment, must have regard to the implications for local responsibility and the financial effect on them, including their capacity to carry out proper management and maintenance of their own dwellings.</P>
    <P>The nub of my comments earlier was that as a result of the greater increases that have been provided by the Government in the past few years for old age pensions, some people have been negatively affected by the clawback. We came across this difficulty last year as a result of which I brought forward this amelioration of the situation in this year's budget. In particular, single old age pensioners rather than having their increase of £10 reduced by £2 will get an increase and be better off by £13 as opposed to £8, and I think this will be welcomed by Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the SWA review of the clawback is ongoing. We need to resolve the problem as soon as possible. I know the Minister is aware of the Living in Ireland survey which puts the poverty line at £97.63. If this figure is adjusted in line with prices in 2001, the poverty line is just over £102. If we are serious in addressing poverty it makes no sense that people who receive an increase have to pay part of the increase to other agencies. Much greater co-operation is necessary at an interdepartmental level between the Minister's Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Health and Children. I hope this point will be clear following our discussion on Committee and Report Stages. We are expecting people to live on very small sums of money and it is unacceptable that any other <Col N="460" /> agency, be it Dublin Corporation, Cork Corporation, Limerick Corporation, etc., has a right to take those small increases back through other means. I hope that through discussing these amendments some of the difficulties will be ironed out for the future.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of introducing a personal childcare payment of £20 per child per week.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to introduce a personal child care payment of £20 per child per week. As we said this morning in the discussion on child benefit, the significant increases introduced this year are very welcome. An interesting article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday showed the cost of rearing a child. I am not sure of the years&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost was £43,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost was £43,000. I presume the article was talking about children up to 12 or 14 years of age. We must address the issue of a fundamental basic income for children. Our colleagues in the Combat Poverty Agency and other agencies have a target of £34 or £35 per week per child. Therefore, reaching £67 per month is a long way off that target. We have just about reached the rate for the third and fourth child which has been paid in the UK, although after today's debate in the House of Commons the UK rate may well again surpass ours. The Minister still has a fair way to go in terms of a basic income for children, despite the very welcome and significant increase this year. We expect that the Minister will make further progress if the current Government introduces another budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reaction of most people to whom I have spoken to the welcome increase in child benefit is that in effect the Minister has confused the issue of child income and child care, which are definitely not the same thing. Up to very recent times we have made very little progress in terms of child care. Some of the reasonable proposals made by the ICTU and various other bodies in relation to the interface between tax and social welfare have received very little welcome from Government. Even support for capital child care projects has been very limited up to this year. My constituency is typical of many others where capital child care projects are at long last receiving some reasonable support from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, child care is an ongoing issue and has not been <Col N="461" /> addressed by the Government. In his response on Committee Stage the Minister said that child benefit was the route to take. However, we have a significant way to go before we have a basic income for children which is adequate, particularly for children from deprived backgrounds.</P>
    <P>The Government has not addressed the fundamental issue of child care. This simple amendment, which echoes the plan of the child care 2000 campaign, asks the Minister to address this much more vigorously. Last week, and last year on the same issue, the Minister said we must keep things simple and not have a variety of systems. I have sympathy with the Minister in relation to the zero to five years age group. My colleagues on the Left made proposals that children in this category should have a higher income than those aged above five years. In practice it is very difficult to envisage the operation of cut-off points as people note how strictly the Department cuts off the child dependant allowance as soon as a child reaches his or her 18th birthday. If the child is not in education then the child dependant allowance is no longer paid. Therefore, the idea of a child losing money once they turn five or six years of age would not seem to be beneficial.</P>
    <P>A major effort is necessary from the Department to support child care. While the increases provided this year are welcome, and I commend the Minister on persuading his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to invest such a large amount of money in child benefit, they do not address the problem of child care, an ancillary but different problem. My amendment seeks to go some way towards addressing that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment which seeks to introduce a personal child care payment of £20 per week. Deputy Broughan referred to the article which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> earlier this week. It is astonishing to consider the costs involved in rearing a child. The article stated the cost associated with a child in the zero to five years age group is £43,000, which includes food, maternity costs, clothing, equipment, toys, etc. It is a considerable cost irrespective of whether they are in child care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>So it is June to June. I am sorry, I took the Minister up wrong.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is making the same argument about the money he intends putting into next year's commitment, it still will not bring us up to the kind of support we need for child benefit. I will not discuss a later amendment which deals with this matter but the Government has been slow to move in the direction of substantially increasing child benefit as a means of dealing with child poverty.</P>
      <P>My party had some views on this some years ago and argued, whether one agreed or not with our original proposal for zero to five and then from five upwards, for a substantial increase in child benefit for which the surpluses were there to provide. The Government has moved substantially in that policy direction this year but it has taken four years in office to do so. We should have had this movement in policy much earlier, then we would have been able to effect the kind of policy changes the Minister wants to introduce but cannot.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment. There are two different arguments here and one useful aspect of Committee Stage was the opportunity we had to unravel the kind of confusion that exists about child benefit. Virtually all young parents in Dublin must now work to pay their mortgages. We are either serious about providing child care for parents who have to work or we are not. Despite all the announcements and strategies which have been put in place by the Minister, we have fewer child care places in the city this year than last year. That is due to a number of reasons and not just because of capital costs, which I accept. It is also a result of the implementation of new health board regulations, which is welcome, but the difficulty is that we have fewer child care places this year than last year.</P>
      <P>That is the route to take to provide people with the chance to enter the labour market if they wish to do so. However, that alternative does not exist now because we do not have the supply and the changes in this Bill will not affect supply but will, if anything, push demand up even further. I support this amendment and encourage the Minister to move in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit late for this amendment. It looks like an amendment from last year as nobody is lobbying on this matter any more. For a couple of years, while the Government was discussing the direction it would take on child care, various lobby groups pushed their own agendas. This was one issue they raised &ndash; a separate child care payment as distinct from child benefit. There were all sorts of lobby groups and the fact that they knew the Government was considering this seriously encouraged certain groups <Col N="463" /> to go off in all sorts of directions. I understand the Government has now made a clear decision on this. There are huge increases this year and in the next two years.</P>
      <P>I remember being at one meeting with many of these groups and they ended up fighting with each other, not to mind us. The Government has made a decision and for right or wrong has picked the option of increasing child benefit as the fairest way of dealing with this matter. I am personally disappointed that we did not go back to the situation years ago when we had a tax allowance for children. I do not know why that was done away with and I would like it partially restored. If one goes for the tax option one is doing nothing for the unemployed. The Government seems to have picked this option and it is hard to tell the Administration is wrong.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage there was debate as to what child benefit is for. Is it for minding a child, for feeding a child or for buying shoes for a child? The Government and the Minister are not trying to tell people what they are supposed to do with child benefit. That does not matter a damn. It is a supplement for parents to cater for the needs of children as they see fit. There does not need to be any deep, logical, consistent thinking involved. It is not a case of saying that people must spend child benefit on crèches or child care. It is a supplement for parents to spend as they will. I am surprised to see this amendment as I thought the main lobby groups had accepted that the Government had made a clear decision and that they had gone away. The Deputy who put down this amendment is looking at last year's agenda.</P>

      <P>I think they have and that the Deputy is trying to resurrect them. There are only embers left. The Government made a clear policy decision and the Minister made a commitment as to what he will do for the next three years. These lobby groups breed and multiply when there is indecision but when there is a clear decision by and large they accept it and drift away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Ahern's comments about tax allowances for children, that may or may not be the best approach but all the research shows that child benefit is the best way to put money in the hands of mothers; it is they who, by and large, look after children, particularly younger children. Although the number of families with only one person working has decreased, over the years tax allowances for children would have put money into the hands of husbands and fathers rather than mothers. However, child benefit is generally accepted as going to the mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hayes said it took the Government four years to do this but that is incorrect. We tend to have short memories about these matters but <Col N="464" /> last year the Government gave what was in effect a 25% increase in child benefit. There was an increase in child benefit of approximately £110 million, which was an increase of 23% to 25%. We gave £8 for the first two children and £10 for the third and subsequent children. That was way above anything given the previous year or any other year. It is amazing to look at the figures over a ten year period. In some years child benefit was not increased at all; the last budget of the Rainbow Coalition gave £1 to the first two children as opposed to the £25 we gave.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the surplus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It gave £5 to the third and subsequent children as opposed to the £30 we gave. This year alone, on top of the 23% to 25% increase from 1999 to 2000, we have given a 58.8% and a 53.6% increase in child benefit. Anyone who could find fault with that is being mealy-mouthed and incorrect. Last year's child benefit was £106 million so it is incorrect to say we have only started this year. The Government agreed this year to do it on a multi-annual basis and indicated that over a three year period starting from this year, £1 billion would be invested in child benefit.</P>
      <P>That is way ahead of anything suggested in any of the partnership agreements. As Deputy Noel Ahern eloquently put it, there are different signals coming from different lobby groups and from within lobby groups. Deputy Broughan's proposal is, to a certain extent, a change from the amendment proposed by some of the lobby groups. He is not going as far as they did in suggesting that the child care payment should be taxed and I would be surprised if he did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an ongoing argument in relation to child care and child benefit and the Government has watched it develop over the past two years. There is anything but unanimity on how to deal with child care. To try to reduce the price of child care for parents is a little like trying to reduce the price of houses, that is, by increasing the supply, which we have successfully done. The same applies to child care places. To reduce the prices for parents, we must give them more choice and deal with the supply side issues, in other words, we must increase the number of places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of places is not as good as we would like but we are starting from a low base. That is the reason the Government dedicated a substantial sum of money in the national development plan to this and, in order to accelerate the provision of places, front loaded some of that money. Instead of the original designation of £46 million in the first year, we decided to allocate £104 million. Even today, the Minister is dealing with grant applications in this area. Deputy <Col N="465" /> Broughan is correct that a sizeable number of grants are being paid to groups. I welcome that.</P>
    <P>That is one side of the equation. The other side is what is called the demand side. There were many conflicting views on this. One lobby group thought we should deal with it through tax, a suggestion that had merit but which would leave out the approximately 30% of people who do not pay tax. We had to be conscious of that. There were also many issues in relation to women who mind their children in the home and who would not have received any assistance on foot of some of the suggestions that were made. The Government decided, in equity, to deal with this issue by giving families, particularly mothers, an amount of money over the three year period so they could make their own choices. We believed it to be the most equitable option. After the three years there will be a sizeable amount of money in people's, mainly mothers', pockets.</P>
    <P>With regard to the number of children, there will be a big difference in the payment. A family with four children, for example, will get an increase of over £25 per week as a result of this year's change. That will be a big help. Last year, when the child benefit books were sent out in September, a number of mothers asked me if they would be paid the £8 or £10 every month. They were surprised at the increase. I have no doubt that when they get the increase of £25 per month for each of the first two children and £30 for each subsequent child in June, they will be particularly pleased.</P>
    <P>I accept it will not pay parents' entire child care costs but anybody who suggests that the taxpayer will be able to pay parents their child care costs is being unrealistic.</P>

      <P>The party was suggesting, in effect, that children become less expensive when they reach certain ages. In my experience, children become more expensive as they get older. I accept there are different stages and circumstances but we looked at every aspect of this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Broughan referred to the Combat Poverty Agency. That agency was extremely pleased with the increases in child benefit and with the commitment to increase it exponentially over the next two years. Another major reason we chose <Col N="466" /> the route of child benefit and provided for substantial increases is that it has a particularly important influence on child poverty, an issue of great importance which this Government is endeavouring to address. Child benefit is a universal payment which is not taxed, unlike other child care suggestions for the tax code that are regarded as benefit in kind and so forth. This is untaxed money that goes into the hands of those who are looking after children.</P>
    <P>Our commitment in this area is second to none. This amendment is somewhat out of date. We will commit ourselves to an extra £300 million after this year and I like to think that, irrespective of what Government is in office, the policy would not be changed and that the investment of £1 billion in this area would be completed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The core of this issue is that the Minister does not recognise that child care and a basic income for children are two separate issues. Even if one accepted the Minister's opinion and if this amendment were passed tonight, if that could be done, there would still be a problem. I referred to the Combat Poverty Agency's estimate, compiled with ESRI and various other agencies, of the most basic income one would need for a child to exist, that is, a basic living income for a child. The Minister has provided about £17 per week for the first two children but even with an additional £20 per week, it would be just about at the agency's income target. The real issue, however, is the cost of caring. It is an issue the Minister still has not addressed.</P>
      <P>He says parents can consider what is the most appropriate caring mechanism if they are both working. I mentioned capital and gave credit for the developments that have taken place. However, this Government will be out of office, whatever happens, before there will be any type of reasonable network, whether it is done through the schools, through local projects throughout the country under the aegis of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or through other initiatives under this Minister's community programme. The capital requirement will not even have begun to be met. The real issue will still be the significant costs of child care and that will not have been addressed. The Minister could address this issue by way of this amendment, by giving parents vouchers or, as the chairman of the committee on social affairs suggested, through the tax system. It should be done as the issue remains to be addressed.</P>
      <P>When we canvas in the next general election this will be one of the four or five issues which people will raise. That is why I will press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what the Minister may think, child care is one of the most important issues we face, particularly in urban areas. The Minister likes to lecture us about his propaganda of the past number of years. However, he forgets <Col N="467" /> that this is his fourth year in office. It is a bit rich for him to start enunciating revolutionary policies at the end of a Dáil term. The Minister has failed to adequately deal with this issue as have all other Ministers. They realised child care was an issue when Fine Gael and other parties highlighted it over the past number of years. Ministers came together in a cabal and had to come up with the policy and slowly moved towards our position.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has moved towards the position as outlined by Fine Gael in 1998 in respect of providing a significant sum of money to deal with child benefit. How we distribute the money is another matter but the Government has moved in our direction. However, it is too little, too late.</P>
      <P>At the next election the Minister and his colleagues will have to account for their actions to the people. The facts are that child care costs have gone through the roof, the Minister has not put the infrastructure in place, he was late to the debate when he realised we had stolen the ground from under his feet some years before and he thinks he can turn the situation around at the last minute. People will not buy that approach.</P>
      <P>A number of women from my constituency appeared on RTE on budget night and expressed considerable disappointment with the increases in child benefit. While the Minister was in the House believing his own propaganda and talking about the £25 and all the rest of it, people on the streets were wondering on what planet the Minister was living. He is out of touch with the fact that he has failed to deal with this issue over the past four years.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he has set aside £1 billion over the next three years. If he has set aside the money and it is a firm policy commitment, what are the rates? Surely he should be able to make a projection as to how much he wants to give people if he has set out the broad policy parameters in terms of the amount of money he has to spend.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of bringing the child benefit for twins into line with the provision for multiple births of 3 or more children.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On committee stage, the Minister said he was sympathetic to the issue concerning parents of twins, who effectively get one and a half rates of child benefit. Parents of triplets and parents in the case of other larger multiple births get double benefit. The organisation representing parents of twins has made a very eloquent and well argued case that the same concession should apply to twins as to larger multiple births. The Minister said on Committee Stage that he would look at the matter seriously, along the lines of the amendment. I urge him to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an extensive discussion on this on Committee Stage. It has cropped up on every social welfare Bill, for as long as I have been in the House. There is an unfair distinction between children in multiple births, as Deputy Broughan has quite rightly said. I pay tribute to the work of Mairéad Hilliard, from the Lucan area, who has been pointing out the glaring anomaly which exists in the current code. I suggest that the Minister, who has substantial funds at his disposal and who makes great play, at various times, of disbursing that money, could greatly assist the relatively small group of people in the multiple births category by providing for an equitable distribution.</P>
      <P>It is wrong that there should be discrimination in child benefit payments as between twins and triplets or other multiple births. The Government is moving towards a policy of individualisation. Yet, this is a classic case where each child is not treated individually or fairly. The Minister has the money and the opportunity to correct this anomaly. I hope he will move in the direction of our amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I now have more complete figures than I gave earlier in this debate. In 2001, the total expenditure on child benefit will be £760 million, as compared to £500 million last year and £444 million in the previous year. Back in 1995, it was £300 million.</P>
      <P>On the issue of double payments for twins, I compliment Mairéad Hilliard for her work over a long period. When in opposition, my party undertook to take action on this issue and a document was submitted to Ms Hilliard in May, 1997. Deputy Woods, as our party spokesperson on social welfare at that time, made a number of commitments, including a commitment to increase child benefit by 50% for twins. That was subsequently included in our policy document. On coming to office, I had further correspondence from Mairéad Hilliard in October 1997, calling on the Minister for Finance and me to honour that commitment by providing for a 50% increase in the December 1997 budget in the monthly payments for all twins in receipt of child benefit. We did that. In our 1997 budget, we totally fulfilled our pre-election commitment. The Labour Party is making plenty of promises these days. My party fulfils its pre-election promises, as we did on this issue in the first budget and the first Social Welfare Bill of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to outline how this payment has evolved. Before 1993 there was a once-off grant of £300 payable on the birth of triplets and £400 where four or more were born together. I accept that births of four children or more are infrequent, but these were the grants in vogue at the time in question. These arrangements were extended to include births of twins in 1993, when a grant of £200 was introduced. Up until then, there was not any recognition of the extra costs involved for people who had twins. In 1996, my predecessor, Deputy De Rossa, increased the <Col N="472" /> grant payable in respect of twins from £200 to £500. In addition, he introduced a new grant of £500 which would be payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12. These were the only changes made at the time and they cost a measly £700,000.</P>
    <P>When I entered office, a much more dramatic change was made. We introduced two key improvements in the Social Welfare Act, 1998, which were designed to improve the overall package of benefits to parents in the case of multiple births. First, the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% on foot of a promise we made in the months preceding the last election. Second, we went further by extending the £500 grant, previously confined to families with twins, to include families with multiple births of three or more children. Both of these measures took effect in September 1998. Those enhanced child benefit payments were given at the appropriate level within the child benefit scheme and they were in recognition of the extra costs incurred by families with twins.</P>
    <P>I have been lobbied by Members on the opposite side of the House and by Members of my party &ndash; the latter raised the issue at Parliamentary Party meetings and on an individual basis because they were, in turn, lobbied by Mairead Hilliard &ndash; about this matter. I did not revisit this issue until now because I had to deal with other pre-election commitments which had to be fulfilled during the lifetime of the Government. Given that its term of office is drawing to a close, other ancillary issues, such as increasing the payment for twins to 200%, will obviously be placed on the agenda. I cannot make any promises but I have indicated that the matter would be up for consideration.</P>
    <P>Since entering Government, my party has delivered on the commitments it made prior to the last election. We have gone slightly further in respect of grants and we have substantially increased rates of child benefit. The more we increase child benefit rates, the more costly it will become to give the additional 50% in respect of twins that Mairead Hilliard is requesting. We estimate that to give double child benefit, based on this year's figures alone, would cost an extra £10.2 million. That figure has risen substantially because of the sizeable increases in the rates of payment.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, this issue needs to be addressed and it will be placed on the agenda. I would like to think we will be able to do something, but I cannot make any promises. I reiterate that we fulfil our commitments. I have been circulated with a number of items of correspondence, from Deputies on all sides of the House, by Mairead Hilliard. On 2 March, Deputy Hayes wrote a letter to Ms Hilliard stating that the Fine Gael amendment had been refused.</P>

I also received a letter which was sent to Mairead Hilliard by my predecessor on 10 December 1990 which stated that she had a justifiable case. That is very strange because Deputy De Rossa, who was Minister for three years, did virtually nothing about this issue. Deputy Broughan's party was a member of the Government in which Deputy De Rossa served as Minister. In his letter, Deputy De Rossa referred to former Deputy Eric Byrne who is no longer with us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;a number of profound initiatives were introduced, despite the obvious constraints. As already stated, for example, Joan Burton put forward the idea of assigning to child benefit the key role of providing assistance to parents with children and Deputy De Rossa doubled the numbers of people who were eligible for carer's allowance. We can point, with justifiable pride, to achievements on the part of members of the Labour Party when they were in Government.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister accept the amendment? I also pay tribute to Ms Hilliard, with whom I have had correspondence over the years. If the Minister is sincere in his claims about this matter, he should accept the amendment. He should show us that he means business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I nearly reached for the Kleenex when listening to the Minister's contribution because the tears had begun to flow. His comments are a sign that he is on the ropes and on the defensive, given the approach of the general election. He agrees with the amendments, but he <Col N="474" /> saw fit to provide us with a retrospective look at recent history.</P>
      <P>The Minister claims to have gone some of the way to dealing with matters in the first Social Welfare Act he introduced. Deputy Broughan and I are asking him to go all the way. The Minister makes big play of the fact that this massive measure will cost £10.2 million. That is out of a budget at his disposal this year of £6.5 billion. Last year, the budget stood at £5.3 billion which means that there has been an increase of £850 million. When compared to such an increase, £10.2 million is mere peanuts. If the Minister accepts the amendment I will praise him greatly. This is his big day; it is his opportunity to do something for the families concerned. Despite his habit of giving history lessons, I know the Minister wants to take action. This is his chance to impress the families to whom I refer. A sum of £10.2 million is peanuts when compared to the £6.5 billion at the Minister's disposal this year.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister serious about wanting to deal with this anomaly? He has not addressed the issue I raised at the outset. If we are determined to proceed with individualisation, why is it that twins are dealt with differently than triplets, etc.? Why do they have to be discriminated against when we have such a wealth of money at our disposal? The Minister now has a chance to prove that he is the revolutionary he portrays himself to be.</P>

      <P>I do not accept what Deputy Hayes said. Deputies Broughan and Hayes accuse me of giving history lessons but they keep referring back to what they say were the hard old times but they will not give this Government, and my party particularly, any credit for assisting in the economic prosperity we now enjoy. They keep saying it started long before our time, that it started in 1994, yet the history from 1994 to 1997 was abysmal when one considers that old age pensioners got an increase of £1.80.</P>
      <P>In relation to this issue, despite Deputy Hayes's crocodile tears, virtually nothing was done when his party was in Government. He may say there was less money around but it is a question of the priority one puts on certain issues and as far as this Government is concerned, the priority is to help those on social welfare. Our record speaks for itself in that regard because in the past year we more than doubled the increase in the social welfare budget which, for the information of Deputy Hayes, is £6.15 billion. The Deputy claims we should allocate £10 million out of that budget to this area, but what other area does he wish us to delete from that £6.15 billion to make way for this allocation?

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&ndash;The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the implications of providing for a uniform rate of child dependant allowance by increasing the different rates to the maximum rate and of increasing the child dependant allowance for widows and widowers to £20 per child per week.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed in depth the mechanisms whereby we can attempt to increase the income of children and assist parents with young children. Obviously there are disagreements on both sides of the House as to how this can best be achieved. Before Christmas, as I mentioned on Committee Stage, a number of the most significant interest groups who work for people on low incomes and on social welfare made a powerful case that for the first time in seven years we should examine child dependant allowances and consider increasing them this year. There was a general demand, which I tried to encapsulate in the amendments <Col N="476" /> in the name of myself and the Labour Party, that we should move the basic rate of £13.20 upwards to at least the higher rate of £17, which is the rate for widow and widower families, and that that rate should be moved upwards to £20. That would be a much fairer way of examining the future of these allowances.</P>
    <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul made a strong case for this in our pre-budget consultations on the basis that one of the areas in which the Minister and this Government have failed is child poverty. Even by the Minister's own estimates, at least 12% of our children are still living in persistent poverty. I am not talking about being poor relative to the richer families in our society. This is 12% of our children living in poverty in this State. That is the reality and the Minister has failed to reach those children. He has increased child benefit but he has done that across the board for every family but I am talking about the children of families who are the most vulnerable in our society, particularly those on long-term social welfare benefit and assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has refused to respond to those demands. He said the rate will be left at a miserly £13.20 per week and he indicated to me last week that with the child benefit plus the child dependant allowances, the portion of child benefit of that total sum has increased significantly over recent years. I acknowledge that but a powerful argument was made by the advocates of the poorest children in our society that we should at least do a little more for them. One simple indication of our determination to do this would be to examine child dependant allowances this year and to increase them.</P>
    <P>I want to refer specifically to the children of widows and widowers. Often in society there are small groups which, due to social circumstances and the many conflicting demands the Minister has already mentioned, are almost forgotten by Administration after Administration. One of those groups is widows and widowers with young families. My predecessor as spokesperson, Deputy Moynihan-Cronin, put forward many innovative ideas on how we can reach out to those families. I have had strong representations, particularly in relation to the hard heartedness of this Minister towards people who are eligible and who had their own employment record, for example, and those who are on disability benefit. The Minister steadfastly refuses to allow those people draw the widow's pension and the full disability pension to which widows would be entitled. I make a special plea tonight on behalf of those families.</P>
    <P>The reason I tabled these amendments, in particular amendment No. 13, is that I received many representations from young widows who wanted to know why the rate was only £17. That is significantly higher than what most of the other people on social welfare benefit and assistance receive but why is it not at least £20 or perhaps higher? That is a major question the Minister could answer. I know we have had policy discussions <Col N="477" /> about child benefit. That is the way to go but a huge proportion of our children live in persistent poverty which the reviews of the social inclusion projects have highlighted again and again.</P>
    <P>We have had some appalling international comparisons of child poverty and the performance of this Government over the past year or two. When I questioned the Minister in the House about it, he dismissed it as based on the 1995, 1997 figures and so on. Even on the most recent assessments, a very significant proportion of children are in persistent poverty. The child dependant allowance mechanism is one way of delivering extra money to those families. The Minister and Deputy Noel Ahern, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs, acknowledged that we have had widespread discussions about child care and child income. It is one of the most important social issues. We must look at and develop child benefit. We are looking at taxation and I suggested that we might give child care payments to families directly or through a voucher system. That has been discussed. However, the problems of the poorest families and children remain.</P>
    <P>After seven years, despite what the Minister may say, we have reached a point where we must look at it again. Social affairs specialists say there might be a disincentive effect. On Committee Stage, the Minister stated that it might be a disincentive to widows and widowers to remarry. That is an extraordinary reason to give regarding the possibility of increasing benefits in this area. We must look at the child dependant issue. All we can do is ask the Minister to consider it for next year which means it will be eight years since there will have been an increase.</P>
    <P>Thanks to the strong economic performance, we have fewer people in long-term unemployment. Our local agencies are targeting people with disability, those who had addiction problems, ex-offenders and others to encourage as many as possible into work. I agree with the Minister that having a job is the fastest way out of the poverty trap. However, there is still a core significant group of children who are most deprived and child dependant allowances are a way to combat that given that there is general disdain for taxing child benefit to help more deprived children. The only other mechanism we have is child dependant allowances. I urge the Minister to accept these modest amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak to amendment No. 36 but I support amendments Nos. 13 and 14 in the name of Deputy Broughan. While we had an opportunity to debate this on Committee Stage, I am not clear about the Minister's reasons for not increasing the child dependant allowance and have one uniform rate. I do not understand his arguments. It is unacceptable that the child of an unemployed man or woman gets £13.20 while the child of an invalid person gets £17 and a widow's child receives £15. What is the justification for classifying this allowance on the basis of whether <Col N="478" /> someone is a widow or widower, or is unemployed. Whatever the arguments about having two rates for children under and over 12, which my party has commented on before, there cannot be any argument about increasing the allowance for those under 12, or any argument for the distinction between different classifications of people because of the allowances they receive. As Deputy Broughan said, we have poverty traps because of this distinction.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to tell us what amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 36 will cost the Exchequer? I reckon approximately £30 million to £35 million to have one unified rate for all child dependants. As Deputy Broughan said also, there has not been any improvement in recent years. The facts speak for themselves. Just more than one million people, 29.6%, of the population, are children. We have higher than the EU average of 21%. Recent research shows that 25% of our children live in households with half the average income. That is &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; poverty and this is one of the few measures which can be targeted towards them because they live in households with small incomes.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes a unified rate should be implemented and that the child dependent allowance should be increased. It is not a major cost to the Exchequer. The Minister can do something significant with £30 million to £35 million for the poorest families, which find themselves in a difficult situation. He trumpets his £25 increase in child benefit but is silent on the issue of child dependant allowance. I ask the Minister to reconsider this since the amount is small given his £1 billion spend this year.</P>
      <P>This is the nuts and bolts of this Bill. Why does the Minister continue to distinguish between the amounts of money given on child dependant allowance to one classification of person by comparison to another? Why is the widow's son different to the son of an unemployed man? Why is that distinction made?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not have the opportunity to do something important by unifying the system and increasing the allowance? He argues how effective increasing child benefit is for all income classifications because the wealthy and the poor get the same. However, this allowance is really targeted towards those who are on low incomes and live on small sums. In his contribution on previous amendments, the Minister stated that he wants to prioritise certain groups. This is the opportunity to prioritise groups on small incomes. A unified system and increased allowance will make a difference for that group. The Minister has done little about this. It is not the headline strategy because it does not win middle-class plaudits. It is a measure that will focus resources on groups who need them. Where better could he apply prioritisation?</P>

      <P>Widows and their families are a very important segment of society, who have particular needs. It is wrong to say this Government is not looking after them and their families as regards social welfare and taxation. It is difficult to separate social welfare from the overall situation without taking taxation into account. Not every widow is at the lowest economic and social scale. The Government has come up with imaginative proposals as regards the taxation of widows, with extra allowances being allowed in this budget.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that child benefit is a better way of paying for children than the child dependant allowance, which is an historical anomaly. Child benefit is more useful and more equitable. These amendments regarding the child dependant allowance have been put down because of the existing situation where child dependant allowance is part of the system. To see an increase of £25 for the first and second child, and one of £30 for the third and subsequent children is very significant. Similar increases, I understand, will come about in 2002 and 2003. When the Government came into office, it stated that the contributory old age pension would be £100 before it went out of office. Only 80% of the way through the term of office, the pension is £106. Although the Government says there will be increases in the next two years, I hope the estimates will be exceeded, which would be consistent with what the Government has done since 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers of people caught in consistent poverty is a problem. I am a Deputy for Dublin South Central, and recently I looked at the map of the socio-economic demographics of the country. It immediately showed that the area I represent is the most socio-economically deprived area in Ireland, including other constituencies in <Col N="480" /> Dublin. My constituency colleagues, Deputies Gay Mitchell, Briscoe, and Upton, as well as Deputy McGennis, are very involved with poverty in the south west inner city in areas like Fatima Mansions, Dolphin House and St. Teresa's Gardens. This Government has made a huge infrastructural input in such areas for children in consistent poverty. The past three years have seen a significant alleviation in that poverty, due to increases in child benefit and other social welfare payments. Deputy Flood and the Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan have worked to see that these areas get more money.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Hayes would agree that the effects can be seen in areas like Fettercairn, in his constituency. A huge number of community groups, voluntary and paid groups, have set up child care facilities which will alleviate the poverty that is endemic in certain areas of Dublin and Cork. Poverty goes further than a lack of money, which can be used to buy cigarettes and an odd pint, which nobody would deny to anyone.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broughan stated there is a general disdain for taxing child benefit. A couple of months ago I was on television with an esteemed former Labour Party TD and Minister for Social Welfare, who suggested that child benefits be taxed. I asked whether it was Labour Party policy to tax child benefit, and obviously there is a cohort within that party who believe it should be. I am glad, therefore, to hear Deputy Broughan speak of the general disdain for that form of taxation, and I accept that his colleagues agree.</P>

It is important that people do not simply say we should put the parents out if the children engage in anti-social behaviour. We have to look at the underlying causes of anti-social behaviour. What we must do is ensure, as this Government is, that there are community facilities, educational opportunities, child care, homework clubs, in other words, every incentive for these children not to engage in anti-social behaviour. Before throwing families out of estates and moving them into private rented accommodation where they are looked after by health boards, which will do the children no good and retard any development that might have happened, that should be taken on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are ever to break the cycle of poverty, we must target child poverty. We know, through the National Economic and Social Forum, that about 250,000 children live in households which are solely dependent on means tested social welfare payments. We also know that about 12% of children live in consistent poverty and that about 20% live in relative poverty. There is an unanswerable case for giving significant increases in child dependant allowances because that is one way in which we can target child poverty and break the cycle of poverty. If we do not break it with children who are living in poor families then we have little hope of breaking the whole cycle of poverty. One of the factors in relation to this is that the child dependant allowance has not been increased for seven years and that makes it more and more difficult for children <Col N="483" /> from poor homes to remain in education. Where they remain in education, many of them are working, and that does not lend itself to obtaining an education because if they are working in pubs and clubs during the school term, at weekends and on week nights they are not in a fit state to attend school on Monday morning. They are so involved trying to ensure a reasonable standard of living in the household that their studies take second place.</P>
      <P>I was surprised, almost shocked, to hear Deputy Ardagh's suggestion that there should be no child dependant payments. Is that what this Government is about? Are we seeing the phasing out of child dependant allowances? That there has not been an increase for the past seven years suggests an ulterior motive. I hope that does not reflect the policy of Fianna Fáil or of any other politician in this House. Many agencies, including the St. Vincent de Paul, CORI and the Combat Poverty Agency have made a very strong case for increasing child dependant allowances because they are a significant way of targeting child poverty and breaking the cycle of child poverty.</P>
      <P>Successive Governments have in the past made the excuse that resources were not available. However, this year and for the last number of years, a significant budget surplus has been and continues to be available, and that money should be targeted in this area. The Minister suggested during this debate that the whole area of social welfare is a matter of prioritising. If there is a case for prioritising, there is a very significant case for prioritising child dependant allowances because then we would not continue to be in a situation where approximately 12% of our children live in consistent poverty. That should not be allowed to continue. We should target poor children through the child dependant allowance and I would ask the Minister to look at that possibility in the future. We should target poor children through the child dependant allowance. I ask the Minister to give consideration to this proposal.</P>

      <P>Depending on the way one looks at them, I have some sympathy with the proposals in the amendments. One could say that the expert report issued some years ago, which seems to be the Bible in this area, said that we should go in the direction of child benefit rather than the child dependant allowance. This has been the gospel for the past few years. Six or seven years ago everyone agreed that the child dependant allowance acted as a disincentive for people to take up employment.

      <P>I am putting the two points of <Col N="484" /> view. I hate it when quangos or expert commissions put forward proposals which try to tie down the political system and to take away flexibility.</P>
      <P>In recent years the Minister has spent the money on child benefit. While there is a logical reason for so doing, it may be time after six years to look again at the child dependant allowance. This might be a case of politicians wanting to have two bites of the cherry. We have gone in the direction of child benefit, but if it is decided to go in the direction of the child dependant allowance we should try to amalgamate and co-ordinate them. It is difficult to understand why one person receives £13.20, while others receive £15.20 or £17. The Minister may say that he has allocated his money for the next three years to the huge increases in child benefit. It is difficult to see how he can make savings in this area, unless he is brave and takes on board the Dáil committee recommendation, which he does not like, that the same amount should be given to every child in child benefit and that the concept of the first and second child be abolished. When we drift back to the child dependant allowance in two or three years the first step should be to amalgamate and co-ordinate it with child benefit before moving forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all concerned about child poverty and want to do everything possible to eradicate it and help those caught in poverty traps. Education is probably the best way of breaking the child poverty cycle. What is the definition of a &ldquo;child&rdquo;? There is much pressure on children to leave school early to take up employment. There are two reasons for this, poverty in the home and the attraction of low paid jobs.</P>
      <P>In this context, I wish to refer to a specific group. Today I rang the Department following representations from a constituent regarding a low income family whose children were encouraged to do the transition year in school. One of the children, who is 19 years, no longer qualifies for child benefit and cannot draw a social welfare payment. The family is receiving no income for this child, and I ask the Minister to respond to this dilemma. The number of students in this position is small, but the pressure on them to leave education and take up employment is huge. Obviously they do not qualify for a third level grant or back-to-education allowance. There is a small but increasing number of low income families caught in this poverty trap due to the popularity of the transition year. I am interested in the Minister's response to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I plead with the Minister to deal with the issue of the child dependant allowance this year. The system is unjust, unfair and untenable. This has been brought to the attention of the Minister on a number of occasions since he took up office but regretfully he has not done anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> I want to highlight the anomalies in the system by comparing the position of three children in the same class whose parents are in receipt of social welfare payments. If the parents of the first child are in receipt of unemployment assistance or the parent is in receipt of a single parent allowance he is worth £13.20 per week, if the parents of the second child are in receipt of invalidity payments he is worth £15.20 per week and if the parent of the third child is in receipt of a widow's or widower's allowance he is worth £17 per week. These children are treated unequally and unjustly. The system is helping to increase poverty traps. Since 1994 we have repeatedly asked for the system to be changed, yet successive Governments have not changed it. How can the Minister preside over a Department which says to one child that he qualifies for a payment of £13.20, while it says to another child that he qualifies for a payment of £15.20 and to a third child that he qualifies for £17? This cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>The major difficulty facing the Minister is that the Minister for Finance, who holds the purse strings, will not give him the money to pay the higher rates. This is ironic given that the social insurance fund is in surplus and some of those payments are benefit payments to which people are entitled by virtue of having paid stamps. In recent years the Minister has put money from the social insurance fund into another fund, yet he is presiding over an unfair system.</P>
    <P>The real reason he will not change the system is that the vast majority of child dependants under the social welfare code are being paid for at the lower rate of £13.20. The Government or any other Government would not have the gumption to reduce all rates to £13.20 but would have to go to the top rate of £17. That is the real reason you will not change the rates of child dependant allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that the Minister is not prepared to change those rates because he would have to bring them all up to the top rate of £17 and he realises that would be costly for his Department. I have no doubt it was one of the options given to him by his officials because they would be just, fair and honest and would bring forward this proposal every year suggesting what he should do and the cost. However, he will say that in a report on all these payments it was considered that the child dependant allowance <Col N="486" /> should not be increased, that the best way of giving money to families was through child benefit. I agree with that. It is probable that he will also say that the report stated it could be seen as a disincentive to work if the rates were increased. That report was prepared some time ago and in the meantime the economy has improved, more people are at work, there is more money in the social insurance fund and wages have increased, but unfortunately poverty has not been greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>The back to work allowance is in place and it takes into account the child dependant allowance. The back to work allowance is a percentage of the social welfare payment and is based on the number of adults and the number of children. Given that it is based on the social welfare payment, the Minister cannot conclude that that payment is a disincentive to work. There was no back to work allowance when the report was published. All that has been surpassed. The back to work scheme has been a tremendous success and it has encouraged people to return to work. The Minister's position is untenable. I hope he will have the good grace to realise, given that the money is available and the social insurance fund is flush, he should consider this measure out of justice to all children. All children of the nation should be treated fairly and justly. To have different rates of social welfare based on the recipients position under the social welfare code is unjust. I ask the Minister to reconsider his views and to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said he would have a look at this issue. I welcomed that because it should be revisited. What is needed is a comprehensive package to tackle child poverty. Will the Minister look at another aspect linked to this amendment, that is, setting new targets for the elimination of child poverty. The child dependant allowance could play an important role. Equally there is an urgent need for these new targets which are to be agreed with the social partners. I understand from a reply to a recent question that they have not been agreed. There is an urgency about this matter which all Members share. It is clear from the contributions that Members are of the view that this is an area that must be tackled urgently.</P>
      <P>Given the Celtic economy, many people do not believe those rates of child poverty exist. There may be some change from the most recent figures but it still represents a substantial disadvantage for huge numbers of children who are not gaining from the opportunities and are featuring in the poverty statistics. This means Ireland has the highest proportion of child poverty in the EU. Many cannot believe that is still the case but it is the reality. A package of measures is needed, one of which is to change the child dependant allowance. Many of the voluntary groups have changed their minds and are supportive of increasing the child dependant allowance. They see it as a targeted way of dealing with the child poverty issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> The Minister said child benefit is one mechanism to tackle poverty. As the CORI document reminded us recently, 40% of child benefit goes to low income families and 60% goes to families with higher incomes. Obviously child benefit is a mechanism for supporting families. I ask the Department to devise a range of initiatives to tackle child poverty and not to rely exclusively on child benefit because I do not think it will work. The Government assumption is that child benefit can pay for child care, but that is not the case given that child care costs are high and the supply is low. A huge problem for low income families is that the support services are not available &ndash; this was clear from the recent report on one parent families. They found it difficult to access high quality child care. It was a catch 22 in that it was difficult for them to combine work and family life simply because the support services were not available.</P>
    <P>An issue I raised with the Minister recently is what constitutes a basic income for children in need and what is his Department's assessment of it? The most recent report on the issue is from the Combat Poverty Agency in 1992, which is out of date. Based on the figures at the time for child benefit and child dependant allowance, most families would still be short by a number of pounds. The State has not set down a basic minimum adequate payment for children as it did for adults through the Commission on Social Welfare. The cost of child rearing needs to be taken into account when deciding what constitutes a minimum income for children. Rearing children is expensive and there is huge pressure on parents. Will the Minister look at this area and outline the package of measures needed &ndash; child dependant allowance, child benefit and other initiatives &ndash; to begin to tackle a problem which, if left as it is, will have appalling consequences. Child poverty leads to disadvantage in later life. People will opt out of education and employment and will be unable to avail of the opportunities. It is a serious issue and one that all Members are agreed on. It demands a comprehensive response from the Minister and this amendment is one aspect of what that response should be.</P>

      <P>The Government will not tax the massive child benefit increases which it has provided this year nor will it do so next year or the year after when it returns to power. I will come back to Deputy McGrath on the amount people will receive in child benefit increases over the next three years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the child poverty targets. The Government should be given credit in this regard. The national anti-poverty strategy was devised in 1997 by my predecessor. The targets set were extremely conservative and primarily related to unemployment. They were supposed to be achieved over ten years but were met after two years which coincided with this Government's term in office. It was decided in the run-up to the renegotiation of Partnership 2000 which resulted in the agreement of the PPF that we would agree new targets with the social partners and address other issues, among which was child poverty.</P>
      <P>A working group was set up under the PPF which comprises representatives of the social partners, my Department and other Departments to examine child poverty. It is very much on the Government's agenda. Everybody researching this issue believes the best route to alleviate child poverty is child benefit. No so called expert in this area would say otherwise.</P>

      <P>It is important to outline the position regarding CDAs. Deputy Healy and others referred to prioritisation. The Government has not shied away from this allowance. There are three different CDA rates and the reason for that is largely historical. At one stage, as Deputy McGrath said, there were 36 different rates but the number has been reduced to three.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGrath is correct in regard to the loss of the CDA as a result of a life event, primarily taking up employment. However, the allowance is also a disincentive to widows to marry because they lose it. That issue is addressed in the amendment but in regard to the disincentive to work, all research, which has been followed by successive Governments, has shown that resources should be concentrated on child benefit because it is not lost when the payment stops, it is not taxed and, most important, it is paid to the primary carer. It is the best way to pay the woman who cares for the children rather that providing a tax allowance, as some people suggest, the benefit of which may not find its way into the woman's pocket.</P>
      <P>Child benefit as opposed to CDAs does not contribute to the poverty trap and is not a work disincentive because it is a non-means tested, universal payment which is not taxed. It is a net payment.</P>

      <P>In 1994 child benefit represented 29% of the total child benefit-CDA payments for a four child family. It currently represents 47% and from June next will rise to 57%. Deputy McGrath referred to the back to work allowance but that issue is not all he makes it out to be. The reality is somewhat different.</P>
      <P>The freezing of the CDA and concentrating resources on child benefit was examined by the tax welfare integration group which reported in 1996, three years after the back to work allowance scheme was introduced. It made a similar recommendation which was accepted by late, great, and I am not sure if he is departed, Deputy De Rossa. That defeats the Deputy's argument.</P>

      <P>This is accepted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the ESRI. Child benefit is given because it favours larger families. The cost of CDAs in the current full year amounts to £257 million. The introduction of a standard rate would be extremely costly and would obviously impact on the money we might be able to allocate to child benefit. To bring all CDAs up to £17 would cost £49 million and to bring them up to £20 would cost about £102 million. Deputies opposite said it is raised every year as a possible thing to do. I assure them that on no occasion since I have become Minister have my officials advocated or suggested to me that I should move in the way suggested by Deputies opposite in regard to this&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is important to outline the increases in child benefit during our period in office. In 1998 we increased child benefit by £28 million; in the 1999 budget we increased it by £40 million; in 2000 we increased it by £106 million and this year we are increasing it by £328 million. Before coming to office expenditure on child benefit was £397 million. Our first three budgets increased this to £575 million, an increase of 40%. The increase in 2001 constitutes a full year investment of £330 million. Over the period we have been in office child benefit has increased dramatically.</P>
      <P>Particularly for the benefit of Deputy McGrath, who will feel very aggrieved that he is not a child these days, I wish to point out that as a result of the changes we are making in June&mdash;</P>

      <P>Maybe he is a child. As a result of the changes we will make in June this year the lower rate will increase to £67.50 and the higher rate will increase to £86, a massive increase on last year. Next year, as a result of budget changes on 5 December which the Government hopes to implement before the next election, the lower rate following the second tranche of the three year plan will be £92.50 and the higher rate will be £116. This is if we do not give a little extra in the case of twins or put some money into CDAs. I am assuming everything will go into&mdash;</P>

Deputies on the other side should look at the research put forward by the Combat Poverty Agency and perhaps at its statement following the most recent budget which complimented the Government on the direction we took. Deputies could also examine the research which fed into the tax and welfare integration group which again confirmed the view that it is better to freeze the CDA and to put all available money into child benefit.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the Minister in replying to Deputy Stanton indicated a child in transition year who is 19 years of age and is not receiving child benefit could get child dependant allowance.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are important. This is the first year the weekly rate of child benefit for the first two children will be greater than the child dependant allowance when the new rates are introduced. Therefore it is a moment when we should look back and reflect. I think Deputy Ahern and Deputy Ardagh agree that more than 20% of children are living in poverty, with 12% or one in eight of our children living in persistent poverty. The Minister has not addressed the real issue. It seems as though we cannot target these children through the tax system, and what I and the Labour Party are suggesting is that we again consider targeting a sum of £100 million, a small amount in the context of a budget of £20,000 million, at the most vulnerable children in society. I think the argument has been put strongly. The Minister prefers a poor law system of social welfare provision in which the poorest children are told what their lot will be due to the circumstances of their parents. I again ask the Minister to re-examine the situation in which the poorest children find themselves, at a time when <Col N="493" /> weekly child benefit rates have overtaken child dependant rates, and the possibility of at least modest increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave us a lecture which went from Romania back to Ireland and he spoke about Mr. Ceaucescu. The Minister would know much about Mr. Ceaucescu given his close relationship with the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, through the years. I understand the Minister was Mr. Haughey's chief whip for quite a number of months and learned much at that table. The Minister would also know much about consistency in tax policy given the performance of the Government last week where it did a complete U-turn in respect of capital gains tax. We were told it would be 60% while two years later it has remained at 20%. We will, therefore, take no lectures from the Minister on consistency in tax policy.</P>
      <P>This allowance is a way to help the poorest of the poor. A blanket increase in child benefit means everybody benefits, but by increasing child dependant allowance the benefits are targeted at those who have least. I do not accept the Minister's frivolous argument that experts in his Department who know a great deal about this have advised him not to proceed with this move. I understand this recommendation originally came from the Commission on Social Welfare many moons ago, and virtually nothing has been done since 1995. The Minister has within his grasp an opportunity to use £50 million from an expenditure of £6.1 billion this year to deal conclusively with this issue once and for all.</P>

    <P>6.his failure to deliver on Ireland's Kyoto commitments on greenhouse gases and his long delay in producing the national climate change strategy;</P>
    <P>7.his failure to publish the long promised road safety bill which would introduce a penalty points system to help reduce the carnage on our roads;</P>

    <P>&ndash;the £14 billion strategy for a comprehensive and efficient transport system for the Greater Dublin Area outlined in the recently published Dublin Transportation Initiative Strategy Update &lsquo;A Platform for Change';</P>
    <P>&ndash;the investment of £1.6 billion under the National Development Plan 2000-06 for public transport and traffic management in Dublin, including £200 million in respect of traffic management grants;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party has a long list of items in its motion and there is also a long list from the Government in its amendment. It would be physically impossible in my time to deal with each item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main complaint about the current Minister is his failure to delegate any real authority to local councils. Some of the old practices from 20 years ago are still in force, which is a great mistake. The upturn in the economy has generated much activity and there are numerous areas <Col N="500" /> where the Minister could have delegated responsibilities to local councils. For example, the Minister and his Department insist on having approval over the building of a single rural cottage. That makes no sense whatsoever. We have a housing programme in Wexford and the Minister must approve of each house built, which is a desperate situation. Surely with all the expertise built up in local councils over the years people are competent to make such decisions rather than going to the Minister or his Department for formal budget approval.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department price guide uses a price of £74,000, which is to include land costs, ESB, servicing, legal costs, administrative costs and other matters. The Minister must understand that all costs cannot be levelled at £74,000. He should allow councils to build houses within guidelines &ndash; I accept that a ceiling should be put on this.</P>
    <P>We do not have time to discuss social housing but it will have to be addressed. Conditions are set which no council can meet and the playing field is not level. Tenants are not allowed to purchase their houses although those houses are built with 100% grant aid, or taxpayers' money, from the Department. Those tenants should be given the same conditions as those in ordinary council houses. Affordable housing is not going well at the moment but it may be the one way we can tackle the growing housing lists.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed miserably to deal with county roads. Wexford County Council only got 14% to 15% funding and the surface testing cycle is now 22 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>Our care for the environment is certainly showing, particularly if one thinks of our waste management. The economy will suffer if we do not break the link between economic growth and environmental deterioration. Waste management is the single most important issue facing us. We have regional and county waste management plans but even though we have plenty of plans we see no action on the ground. The focus in every local authority area is on whether we should have landfill or incineration for our waste but there is no emphasis on developing a recycling culture. There were two million tons of waste produced in 1998 and 91% of that was consigned to landfill, with only 9% for recycling. Only 3% of domestic waste was recycled. We have no infrastructure to develop recycling and there is no encouragement for it. I follow the waste management arguments in every local authority area but I never hear anyone say: &ldquo;Let's develop and encourage recycling.&rdquo; We have adopted aspirational target recycling rates of 35% to 55% depending on the waste one is talking about but there is no emphasis on recycling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average household has no means of recycling. We do not have enough bring sites; half our local authorities have one per 1,000 to 5,000 people, while other authorities have one site per 5,000 to 15,000 people. The European average is <Col N="501" /> one bring site per 500 people, so we are far short of that target. We must have more bring sites and we must also develop the financial means of encouraging recycling, as that will not happen by a miracle. We must intervene financially to ensure recycling works and that a recycled piece of paper is not more expensive than virgin paper, which is the situation at present.</P>
    <P>There are no collection facilities for plastic in the country. Wellman International in Cavan processes four million bottles a day but it must import them. There is no means by which waste plastic can be collected. We have heard much about the proposed tax on plastic bags and it will be interesting to hear how the Minister proposes to collect this 10p levy. Will the onus be on small retailers throughout the country? We read in today's newspapers that 8,000 sheep were smuggled over the Border in the past two months, which shows how easy it would be to bring plastic bags across the Border or from the UK without notifying the authorities. There are serious problems with the practicalities of collecting this proposed levy. That levy does not encourage the use of biodegradable plastic bags and in any case plastic shopping bags are a small part of the total plastic waste generated in Ireland if one looks at the plastic packaging we use. I agree with the principle of encouraging consumers to reduce the amount of plastic bags they use but I have serious concerns about how this levy is to be collected.</P>
    <P>I have read the Minister's statements on plastic bags and anti-litter measures but putting a levy on plastic bags will reduce the amount of plastic going to landfills, which is where environmental damage is created. Plastic survives for a long time in landfills and damages the environment &ndash; that should be the focus of the tax, not a litter tax.</P>

      <P>I welcome Deputy Clune's support for recycling. Perhaps she could spread the word to councillors around the country. Then they could engage positively in the waste management planning process rather than try to disrupt it at every available opportunity for political purposes. Perhaps in her new position, on which I congratulate her, she will be able to exert some influence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past year or so there has been a virtual assault by the Labour Party on the people of Ireland in relation to the need for a renewal of confidence in the political system, to ensure high standards in public life and to enforce high standards of integrity and honesty. At the same time, it has launched a series of highly personalised attacks on members of the Government, thinly disguised as political charges. The Labour Party has attempted to mislead this House and the public with false accusations of conflicts of interest at a time when that party <Col N="502" /> believes it occupies the moral high ground and when it lectures everybody else on standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>To crown that, the Labour Party has put this motion before the House. The motion is misleading, inaccurate and untruthful. It displays either a depth of ignorance about what is happening or a frightening level of political dishonesty, many times worse than anything its members have condemned during this current period of virtue.</P>
      <P>If that party is interested in restoring confidence in politics and raising standards, its members should act in an exemplary manner. All Members of this House have a duty to ensure that what they do or say does not add to the public cynicism that currently exists. The approach of the Labour Party for some time has been to throw accusations wildly in the House, to cast aspersions and to use innuendo and untruths in the House. Its members have sunk to the depths, hoping that if they throw enough mud, some of it might stick. In the recent past, they have done more to increase public cynicism and to lower standards in politics than anybody else in the House.</P>

      <P>Take the housing issue as an example. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, <Col N="503" /> dealt with the areas within his remit last night and I will not repeat his contribution. However, I will again remind the Opposition of the mess the rainbow coalition left in the housing area.

      <P>&mdash;fuelled by increasing demand. Did its members act? They only made matters worse. I am glad Deputy Quinn is present. It was he, as Minister for Finance, who introduced swingeing increases in stamp duty on mid-priced houses, prevented home owners from trading up and distorted the market which was already under pressure.</P>
      <P>However, at least the rainbow coalition did not display the rank hypocrisy in which the new improved Labour Party, complete with its former Democratic Left members, now specialises. Its performances in relation to housing are a good example of this type of hypocrisy. How often have we seen Deputy Gilmore in this House almost frothing at the mouth in self-righteous indignation? There was a good example of it last night. One would think he is a man who is deeply and passionately consumed with ensuring more houses are built and that more people are taken off the housing lists.</P>

      <P>The reality is different, however. Throughout the length and breadth of this country, Labour Party councillors consistently oppose the efforts of their local authorities to provide housing. In his own local authority, how many times in the past three to four years has Deputy Gilmore written or spoken to his councillors asking them to make more land available for housing?</P>

      <P>I must take issue with some points in Deputy Gilmore's contribution last night. He spoke of people who are accommodated in bed and breakfast premises in Dublin being forced onto the streets during the day. I am surprised the Deputy is so out of touch on this issue, given that he raised it on the Adjournment last November. The current position in relation to Dublin Corporation is that all private emergency accommodation allows residents to remain in occupation 24 hours a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In all newly contracted accommodation, the Corporation insists on free access for residents as well as high standards and 24 hour security. Those are the facts and the Deputy would do well to acquaint himself and his party with them before he comes to the House to make unfounded accusations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, the Deputy accuses the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, of falsely debunking a survey that purported to show that house prices rose by over 20% last year. He went on to say that the increase exceeded 20%. The actual increase was closer to 10%. As so often in the past, all Deputy Gilmore succeeded in proving is his capacity to be well off the mark. He went on to state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues have rejected the many proposals made by the Labour Party to deal with the housing crisis, including our proposals for publicly owned land banks, a national housing authority, fair price certification, legislation to protect tenants and <Col N="505" /> house buyers and a major social housing programme. Instead, they continue to insist that housing is a market problem and that if supply is increased prices will moderate.</P>
    <P>It would be hard to find a better list of facile solutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>It implies, in the face of all logic and the views of every independent commentator, that the solution to the housing situation lies somewhere other than in increasing supply. It also ignores the fact that this Government has undertaken an unprecedented multi-annual social housing programme that local authorities are finding hard to keep up with but which will deliver 25,000 additional local authority dwellings in four years.</P>

      <P>He also advocated publicly owned land banks. Are we to suppose that land held by local authorities, the public bodies charged with delivering social housing, is in some way not publicly owned land? What are we to make of their call for a national housing authority? What will another statutory body contribute to the construction of even one social housing unit?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy voted against it. The Deputy is so out of touch he does not know what his backbenchers are doing.</P>
      <P>Much as it might upset the Labour Party, this Government has not been afraid to take advice and action and adjust its policies in light of changing circumstances. We are maximising housing supply while protecting the interests of first time house buyers. We are stabilising house prices and we have provided record funding for local authority and social housing. We are dealing with the private rented sector and we are providing a guaranteed supply of land for social housing under the Planning and Development Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Government took office we have taken an unparalleled range of actions in the housing area. Those who accuse the Government of failure in this area would do well to examine their own records while in office. Do they think that forced emigration due to a lack of economic success was a satisfactory strategy to ensure that everyone had access to a house? That is what the <Col N="506" /> high tax and spend policies of the Labour Party meant in the past and with over £5 billion extra expenditure already promised by the Labour Party if it returns to power after the next election, it is clear it has learned nothing and would lead us back down that route again.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's dishonest approach to politics is also demonstrated by its lip service to resolving problems and its backing off in a cowardly fashion from making a difficult decision. A classic example of this sort of behaviour is in the area of waste management. In this it has been joined by its equally hypocritical friends, the Green Party. That party believes in the Paul Daniels solution to waste and now the Labour Party seems to believe in the Walter Mitty approach.</P>
    <P>Incredibly two parties in this House have decided to abandon the cornerstones of waste management policy adopted throughout the world. The Green Party has abandoned the waste hierarchy and the Labour Party no longer believes in the principle that the polluter pays. Both parties have consistently attacked the Government for the lack of a waste management policy, yet both have plagiarised large portions of the Government's waste management policy document Changing Our Ways.</P>
    <P>At local level the Green Party opposes facilities for waste recovery. It allegedly supports the waste hierarchy, yet refuses to support waste to energy recovery which is supported by its colleagues throughout Europe. Its brilliant solution for residual waste is to build hundreds of stores and depots around the country to hold the waste.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party opposes every proposal for a landfill facility and then publishes a policy document which advocates at least one landfill in every county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when the thrust of national and EU waste policy is aimed at reducing reliance on landfill, the Labour Party proposes the exact opposite over and above the requirements identified in the waste management plans prepared by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>To cap it all, the Labour Party would also apparently wish to see the abolition of domestic waste charges, even though they are mandatory under EU waste policy and legislation&mdash;</P>

      <P>The progress made on my major programme of local government renewal is there for all to see. Local government, a constitutional amendment and planning Acts were enacted in each of the past three years. Many real, tangible and practical initiatives have been taken in the drive to renew local government. As the time available will not permit me to list these initiatives, I will remind the House that constitutional recognition has been given to local government as an intrinsic, distinct and separate part of our democracy, and with a fixed electoral cycle. A proper funding system to secure the necessary resources for the ambitious programme of local government renewal has been put in place in the context of the local government fund which, this year, is providing funding for discretionary spending to local authorities which is 63% up on the equivalent 1997 figures.</P>
      <P>Under my guidance, the partnership model has been introduced to the local government system by way of strategic policy committees which are now largely established in all county and city councils. A further initiative has seen the establishment of county and city development boards. A wide range of measures to promote efficiencies in local government have been put in place in the interests of customer service generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>All from Better Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, the Local Government Bill will provide a modern basis for local government in this country. It is one component of a comprehensive programme of measures. Above all, it is a programme of action, not rhetoric, to renew our local government system.</P>
      <P>I spoke earlier about the Labour Party's often expressed desire to restore confidence in the political system. I share that desire. The Labour Party also states that the public perception of politicians and the political system continues to deteriorate, and I agree. Where I disagree with the Labour Party is on its so-called solution to the problems we face. It believes such issues should become a political football and an opportunity for political point scoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Labour Party's attitude to this matter does nothing to counter the current cyni<Col N="508" /> cism. In setting preconditions for any discussions on political funding, it is not only acting in a manner which was common in another jurisdiction and which was roundly condemned for 30 years by all parties in this House, but it is further undermining public confidence in the political system.</P>
    <P>We need to seriously address all the issues regarding the funding of the political system, including corporate donations to political parties. If we cannot reach agreement on this issue before the next election, the odium of the electorate will not only fall on this side of the House but on all of us.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and I have consistently asked the Labour Party to join other parties in the House to discuss all issues concerning funding the political process, including corporate donations. There are constitutional issues relating to the rights to free speech, free association and freedom of expression which need to be addressed, and the parties opposite know this from the advice they received during drafting of the Electoral Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, one must consider the views of Mr. Justice McCracken in his tribunal report when he stated:</P>
    <P>The tribunal does not consider it practical to prohibit all political contributions and rely solely on public funding of political parties. Indeed, to do so might give rise to serious constitutional difficulties.</P>
    <P>What has been suggested by the Labour Party, and more recently by Fine Gael, is not a ban on all contributions, but a ban on those coming from corporate sources. Even so, this would also be legally suspect. For a start, what does the term &ldquo;corporate donations&rdquo; mean?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is explained in the Bill passed by this House. For a start, what does the term &ldquo;corporate donations&rdquo; mean? Some people in this House have used the term interchangeably with &ldquo;commercial donations&rdquo; as if they mean the same thing when they clearly do not. What is the basis, other than self-interest, for the Labour Party's proposal that donations from trade unions would continue to be allowed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a second point which should not be missed. We consistently hear from the Opposition benches that the issue, as far as they are concerned, is primarily about the public perception that there is a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the business community in giving corporate donations. If that is the problem, however, why is there any less a perception problem with the main players in business life making similar donations personally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its paper for discussion with party leaders, published last May, a document I welcomed at the time as a useful contribution to the debate, <Col N="509" /> Fine Gael made a very interesting statement as follows:</P>
    <P>We believe much greater discussion is required on the distinction, proposed by Labour, between corporate and other donations, and their treatment as entirely separate categories, which we contend is both artificial and easily negotiated around. Donations to political parties by wealthy individuals, unincorporated businesses, groups lobbying for particular interests or causes, and professional partnerships . . . are not much different from corporate donations and should hardly be treated differently from them in legislation.</P>
    <P>In a separate discussion document on the funding of political parties, also published last May, Fine Gael stated that it &ldquo;does not believe it is possible to distinguish between corporate donations and individual donations&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>For the sake of the democratic process in this country, let all the parties sit down together and deal with the issues comprehensively and quickly. I hope that all parties can agree to this and get on with the serious business involved, with no further delay. I have already made it clear that I am not asking the Labour Party to change its stance on corporate donations. I am simply asking it to join a committee without preconditions, to look at all the angles and tease out all the consequences that changes to the funding system will involve. These include the possible consequences of asking the taxpayer to foot the bill for electoral expenses and the day-to-day running costs of political parties.</P>
      <P>Specifically, I am asking the Labour Party to drop the preconditions&mdash;</P>

I am suggesting a three month timescale for the committee to deliberate on the matter and make its report. I will also ensure that the necessary back-up will be available to the committee to look at constitutional and any other issues that need to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>If Labour takes up this offer, as a gesture of goodwill, I will drop, at this time, the current proposal in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill to increase expenditure limits for candidates at an election.</P>

      <P>Confidence in politics can only be restored if politicians behave with due respect for the people, the political process, the institutions of the State and their fellow parliamentarians. What a pity then to see the Labour Party and the Green Party using valuable Dáil time to table a motion that was so transparently unworthy, inaccurate and untruthful. Indeed, the weakness of this motion could be easily judged by what I can only describe as the embarrassed contributions from Fine Gael. Is it too much to hope that this House can now turn itself to the task of debating real issues, acting in a dignified manner and using its time to best effect?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making this plea, particularly to the Labour Party which was the prime mover behind this current sham debate and which instigated what I can only describe as a campaign of wilful disobedience on the Order of Business, which has also wasted very valuable time. The Labour Party is subverting what it claims to believe in. We are seeing a political party claiming high standards while demonstrating the lowest possible standards. We are seeing a party supposedly devoted to boosting public confidence in politics, but actually destroying that public confidence without any justification. What we are witnessing is all show and no substance&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Having dealt with what I would laughingly call the substance of the motion, I want to make a strong personal point. Like many people in this House, I became involved in politics to try to change and improve things, and to make a difference. I genuinely believe in the political process. I also believe passionately in opposing corruption of all kinds, as I hope most people in this House do. I have proved that by taking action, which at one stage would have put my career at enormous risk. I believe in Dáil reform and I believe that politicians should be seen as valued professionals with very high standards. That is why it angers me so much to see the Labour Party creating sham debates and instigating a campaign of wilful disobedience. In that context, today's cynical performance gives me no pleasure. This is not political cut and thrust. It is poorly researched, unsupported smear stuff, being done in the hope of making a quick-fix contribution to their sagging opinion poll figures.</P>
      <P>As I said in the Upper House recently, I have been accused by the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, of being in a conflict of interest situation.</P>

      <Col N="513" /> Deputy Dempsey is the Minister who, in photo opportunity after photo opportunity, has committed himself to the ideal of home ownership, but who has allowed the price of houses in this city to more than double in just over three years. People who could aspire to owning their own home before the Minister came to office have now been condemned to paying exorbitant rents in the private sector, rents which, over the same period in my constituency, have risen from £400 per month to £800 per month. This is the Minister who has made home ownership a luxury.</P>
    <P>When the Minister moved into the Custom House there were 26,000 people awaiting public housing. One year ago, the last assessment of housing need showed that the figure had increased to 39,176 and 12 months later it is approximately 50,000.</P>

      <P>In the jungle of the Celtic tiger, more people are homeless, fewer can afford a home of their own and the numbers awaiting public housing have almost doubled.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago, the accounting officer for the Minister's Department told the Committee of Public Accounts, in error, that the affordable housing scheme was a considerable success. Not a single affordable dwelling has yet been built. My own local authority this week had its first consultative meeting on the housing strategy required under the Minister's Planning and Development Act and has not even begun to consider the revision of the development plan. Ours is probably the first local authority in the country to approve an affordable housing scheme, but, as yet, not a sod has been turned. There are 3,500 people on the waiting list for public housing and last year the total new public housing build in the county was 103 units.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, also has a central responsibility for the gridlock in a city where all that can move during peak times are the homeless, searching for a sheltered doorway, removed from the noise of yet another telecommunications company digging up the public road.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, we have a waste crisis and the Minister's response is to wring his hands and promise the introduction of a Waste Management (Amendment) Bill later in the year. As local authorities and businesses panic about the waste mountain, the closure of landfill dumps and invigilation by the EU, the best the Minister can offer is to threaten a war on plastic bags. There is still no sign of his promised spatial strategy and the push is on to implement the £40 billion national development plan and worry about the shape of the physical development of the country after the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance sector, the Garda Síochána and all concerned citizens are screaming for legislation on road safety, but the Minister has abandoned the Road Safety Bill, as a priority, in fav<Col N="514" /> our of taking out an each way bet on the general election by facilitating a higher spend for Fianna Fáil. Ireland, with 1% of the population of the EU, is responsible for 10% of the environmental complaints to the European Commission. Under the Minister's stewardship, this country has failed to meet its commitments under the Kyoto protocol.</P>
    <P>The last local elections were postponed because the new bushy tailed Minister for the Environment and Local Government was going to reform local government. The elections came and went and the great reformer was still cogitating. Abolition of the dual mandate is the height of his ambition, but that now is to give way to a compromise worked out with the group described by Deputy Gilmore as the &ldquo;Fianna Fáil Independents&rdquo;. When it comes to protocols, it is not our commitments to Kyoto that preoccupy the Minister but rather Fianna Fáil commitments to Kilgarvan and Kilcoole. When the bogged down Bill re-emerges, existing Deputies will be allowed to retain their council seats until retirement or defeat at the polls. So much for local government reform.</P>
    <P>The Minister has persuaded the media that he is the great reformer held back not by limitations on his own capacity as a visionary but by the hidebound traditional conservatism of proponents of proportional representation and multi-seat constituencies. If only the Minister was given his head. We would have a smaller Parliament of 100 super-paid superior men and women, safely insulated and protected from real live voters, whose minds would be focused on the litter war, the rate of deceleration of accelerating house prices, how to increase corporate donations and design new street signs with legends such as &ldquo;Cow's Lane&rdquo;. &ldquo;Bull's Lane&rdquo; or &ldquo;Poppycock Parade&rdquo; would be more appropriate because, when it comes to housing, waste management, road safety, environmental protection and local government reform, all we get from this Minister is bull and poppycock.</P>

      <P>The Minister has shown indifference for any proposal that does not benefit builders and developers. He has, for example, ignored Labour Party proposals for publicly owned land banks, a national housing authority, fair price certification, legislation to protect tenants and house buyers and a major social housing programme. However, the one area in respect of which the Minister has been consistent and tenacious is that of protecting business funding for politics and legitimising higher spending for Fianna Fáil. Have corporate donations become the core principle for which he and Fianna Fáil are prepared to take a stand?</P>

      <P>That is correct. In his opening remarks, the Minister referred to the attitude of the Labour Party. This is a House of accountability. The Minister was very strong, even within his own party, on demanding accountability in the past. After almost four years in office, it is time he was called to account, not in a personalised way but on the list of 15 specific charges outlined in the motion. The Minister ignored those charges&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not. The Deputy should read the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;which relate directly to his stewardship. The Minster spoke for 30 minutes and he did not refute any of the charges.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, was a man full of promise when in opposition. He had plans and documents, schemes and proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>He was going to do the devil and all. Of a Government made up of lacklustre Ministers, he is the most tarnished. I have no explanation as to why that is the case because the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is very intelligent and hard-working. I believe him to be as straight as a die.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>However, he seems incapable of bringing any proposal, of which he has many, to a satisfactory conclusion. The litany of failure is set out in the Labour Party motion &ndash; 15 key issues which impact on the quality of life of every citizen of this nation, 15 unanswered and unanswerable failures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has already been stated that, in terms of his views on house prices, the Minister must be living in cloud cuckooland. I am aware, from my time there, that the view from the Minister's office in the Custom House is not very good because of the opaque windows. He stated that house prices are under control, when the most recent figures, released only today, show that the average house price in this city has risen by £100,000 since the Minister took office. That represents an increase of more than 100% since he took up his portfolio. More and more people are being forced to put their names on local authority housing lists, the numbers on which are ever-increasing and, we estimate, have reached 50,000. It was 26,000 when he came into office. Throughout the country, local authorities are struggling with ever increasing lists and we are building fewer houses as the statistics given to this House by Deputy Gilmore last night prove. Fewer local authority houses <Col N="516" /> were built in 1999 than in 1995, despite an economy, in the Tánaiste's words, that is awash with money. It is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised action on litter. Ireland, urban and rural, is festooned with litter. The last legislative measure introduced in this regard was the Litter Pollution Act brought in by myself as a member of the Rainbow Government. When will plastic bags be eliminated? We are sick and tired of promises and press releases from a Minister incapable of action.</P>
    <P>Probably his greatest failure in the whole long list is on waste management. Again, the relevant overarching legislation was introduced by the previous Rainbow Government, that is, the Waste Management Act. The Minister proposes new amending legislation but apparently the new amending legislation is a State secret because he will not tell us what is in it. I do not know whether he is afraid to tell us or he has decided to simply put it on the long finger and let local authorities struggle as best they can to address this critical issue in the absence of any coherent national waste strategy.</P>
    <P>I will make a prediction tonight. The failure to deal with waste management, above all others, will damage the Irish economy; above all others, this failure will be a grievous blow to Irish economic prospects. On our obligations under the Kyoto Agreement, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has proven entirely indifferent. He did not negotiate them. He went to Kyoto but he had recently come to office and the European position was largely agreed but he has done nothing to reach Ireland's position. I do not know whether it is indifference or he is just ineffective and his Cabinet colleagues&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the national climate change strategy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;must drive the policy. The other line Ministers obviously ignored the Minister's view on this area. The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, added the title &ldquo;Minister for Local Government&rdquo; to his name tag when he moved into the Custom House. We might have expected some real energy then in bringing about local government reform, especially when the blueprint for that reform, Better Local Government, was actually on his desk when he arrived. The Minister is almost four years in office, one of the longest terms of any recent Minister for the Environment, yet we still have not had the enactment of the local government Bill. In fact, all we have seen is a succession of kite flying from a Minister whose kites invariably crash land, whether they are proposals to directly elect mayors, abolish the dual mandate or his other more vaunted proposals on list system elections and single seat constituencies. They were all announced with fanfare and promptly forgotten.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the last sentence of the Minister's speech as a starting point. He refers to our out of date philosophy. I heard this Government's philosophy clearly and honestly articulated by the person described in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> as the Celtic Thatcher only last week. He said that he believes the market will solve problems such as housing, health and education. I have an honest difference with him. I believe he holds a dangerous philosophy and this Minister, coming along like a little acolyte, is now repeating it in relation to those areas for which he was given responsibility. This Government's response to the housing crisis, which has driven over 50,000 people on to waiting lists, was to say that the market will do it for them, they should just wait and so forth but its first reaction was to deny a crisis existed at all. We then proposed a housing commission. The Government rejected that as well and then it commissioned Dr. Peter Bacon's reports one, two and three which, whether we agreed with them or not, are now in shreds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very interesting that this Minister who has the final responsibility for housing did not come into the House tonight to tell us how he was convinced by the Minister for Fin<Col N="520" /> ance, Deputy McCreevy, that there was merit in keeping capital gains tax at 20% for speculative land. I listened to my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, on his hind legs again and again telling us that the first second and third Bacon reports were an adequate response. I did not hear from him when these reports were thrown out the window. We will remember that their first comments were on capital gains tax &ndash; that there was an argument against reducing it from 40% to 20% for land being hoarded by speculators. It was suggested that we go with the 20% but by 2001 we will increase it to 60% unless the land is released. Where is the evidence that the land was released?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the justification for removing the threat to the speculative class to increase it from 20% to 60%? What has happened in the meantime? Has the land been released? We will never get the answers. There is a common core to the response which is that things have improved. For whom, have they improved? Last week they improved for those who bled the country dry. The people who saw the prospect of a 60% tax removed. They also saw the 2% tax removed. They now can laugh at those on the housing lists.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggests that our philosophy is outdated because we believe that it is a matter of right to have a roof over ones head, to have a house. If he believes that, then there is a clear distance between us. There is something else. He spoke so directly tonight that I have to say something to him. He spoke about our proposals to restore confidence in politics. One does not need a high IQ to know where those people who arrived with their bags and bundles of money came from. They came from the speculators who knew they would have an advantage and knew where to go.</P>
      <P>Lest the Minister wants to expand on his suggestion to restore confidence in Government, I tell him what people in Galway think. I arrived there in 1960 and was elected to the local authority in 1974. This is the first time local authority applicants are being told not to bother coming back for five years. What is causing the housing shortage is the site cost. It is a disgraceful argument that the Minister introduced, suggesting that Labour councillors hold up the provision of building land.</P>

      <P>Regarding the other issues mentioned, particularly in waste management, I plead with the Minister to stop insulting the councillors and the public. The public, who are interested in reduction and recycling and in alternative waste management, want to participate in defining the problem, in waste management or transport, for example. They do not want Ministers telling people to show the public what has been decided and call that consultation. It is time he woke up.</P>

This Government wants incinerators and <Col N="522" /> some very wealthy people will make a great deal of money from them. The Government did not want the flak from imposing them on communities so councillors were given the rubber stamp and asked to do the dirty work. Now that plan is in trouble and&mdash;</P>

      <P>There has been an increase of more than 40% in recent years of families on housing lists. Only 8% of building is social housing. There are 50,00 families on housing lists. In my constituency the numbers have doubled to almost 1,100 on housing lists in South Tipperary. Only 120 houses are being built despite numerous requests to the Minister to approve an increased allocation of land. In the era of the Celtic tiger a family is at least entitled to a roof over its head. Many families will wait up to ten years or more in some major urban centres. In my constituency a family can wait four years to get a local authority house. This can be resolved by the Government's increasing the approvals to local authorities.

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Quinn. As I explained last night, this motion was put down to bring the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to political account for a range of failures. We have listed 15 failures in our motion. The Minister's response has been extremely disappointing; he has offered no defence or explanation why there are so many cases being taken by the European Commission against this country for his failure. He said that the Kyoto target was achievable by 2008; but it has already been exceeded &ndash; the Minister has no explanation for this nor can he explain why most of the measures in his delayed national climate change strategy are not to be implemented until after 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has offered no defence against the damning criticism of him by the chairman of the National Safety Council for his failure to deal with road safety or to introduce road safety legislation. He cannot explain the shortage of staff in the plan<Col N="526" /> ning system, which has led to chaos, nor the delay in implementing the planning Act. The national spatial plan has not yet been produced. He did a U-turn on the moratorium on GMOs. He has not taken effective measures to deal with the problems of traffic and road openings. Legislation promised by the Minister to put a tax on plastic bags and to help deal with the litter problem has not been introduced.</P>
    <P>My party leader will deal with the issue of political funding, but I want to return to housing, which the Minister dealt with in greatest length in his speech which was laced with more invective than fact. He accused me of giving wrong information to the House last night. I admit that I did give inaccurate information in relation to house prices. When I spoke here last night, I was not aware that the Government had published the most recent statistics regarding house prices. They show that the average price of a new house in this country is £141,772 and not £133,459 as I claimed last night. Therefore, the increase in house prices since this Government took office is 93%, and not 82% as I said here last night.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the average price of houses in Dublin is now 120%, and not 107% as I claimed. The position is worse than I believed. The average price of a new house in Dublin, which was £84,000 when the Minister took office, is now £184,000, driving tens of thousands of people away from the possibility of owning a home. In his contribution, the Minister asked us to pay attention to the text of his amendment which said that the Government has secured house price moderation and balance in the housing market. How can the Minister tell somebody who cannot afford to buy a house of their own because he has priced them out of the market that there is house price moderation? How can he tell somebody who is on a council housing waiting list, in some cases for many years, living in overcrowded conditions, with their relationships and their families under stress, that there is balance in the housing market? How can he claim there is balance in the housing market when the property pages of newspapers are advertising luxury dwellings at £1 million and more while at the same time there are families who cannot get access to housing because they cannot afford to buy or rent and cannot get a house from a local authority, and when there are so many who are homeless? How can the Minister justify the fact that 1,000 children in this city are homeless?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister described the passion with which I have previously spoken on these issues. I have done so because people are suffering in this rich country that we hear so much about, in this economy that Ministers tell us is so prosperous in these good times for which the Government claps <Col N="527" /> itself on the back. Tens of thousands of our fellow citizens are living in misery because they cannot have a home of their own. The Minister is primarily responsible for that because, after four years in office, the measures he has taken to address the problem have not been sufficient. They have been inadequate and have ended up putting more money into the coffers of property speculators and developers and taking it out of the pockets of people who are trying to buy a home of their own. Nothing can explain or justify this year's Finance Bill in which the package of measures recommended for landlords is being implemented immediately while the measures intended for tenants are being postponed for two years so that people who have already made massive gains from the kind of land rezoning that is being discussed in Dublin Castle will now end up having their tax reduced through a reduction in capital gains tax. This is not bringing balance into the housing market. It is causing an imbalance which benefits those who already have, takes from those who do not, and deprives families of the right to a home.</P>
    <P>The Minister's performance &ndash; and this is not a personal charge but a political one &ndash; his leadership of his Department over a range of areas has been lamentable and poor, but nothing has caused so much suffering, grief and pain as the failure to deal with the housing crisis which has left so many people suffering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have known the Minister for a long time and I fully endorse Deputy Howlin's regard for his qualities. This is not a personal indictment. It is a political, forensic analysis of systematic failure over nearly four years in office. The Minister is one of the longest serving Ministers in a wonderful Department with which I am somewhat familiar. He has responsibility for changing the lives of many people at a time when the Administration of which he is proud to be a part has more money than any previous Government has ever had. However, his attempt to refute the 15 failures cited yesterday was pathetic. It was an indication of the scale of his embarrassment that he was unable to refute a single statistical fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the one area where the Minister wants our co-operation, the funding of political parties and corporate donations. He is allowing himself to preside over the corruption of Irish politics by bringing forward as a priority the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 2000, that will enable Fianna Fáil and other parties to increase by approximately 50% what they can spend on elections &ndash; in the case of Fianna Fáil, from £2 million to £3 million. As long as the Minister insists on doing this at a time of sickening revelations of wrong-doing in Dublin Castle, of so called legitimate political donations being given to politicians, he is aiding and abetting the corruption of the political process, and I find it hard <Col N="528" /> to understand why he is allowing himself to be so used.</P>
    <P>I suspect the Minister does not believe in corporate donations, but the Taoiseach does. The operation of this Taoiseach, his refusal to engage in debate in respect of corporate donations, is inexplicable. I am told I cannot call him a coward, but I can say that he did not have the political courage, nor did any member of Fianna Fáil, to oppose the Bill we introduced last year. Instead a time lock was put on it which would ensure that it would not be passed on the night on which it was voted upon but would be passed at Second Stage later in the year, December of last year.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach had in his possession legal advice to the effect that the banning of corporate donations was illegal and unconstitutional, then he was honour bound to put that on the record of the House. The Minister has hidden behind quotations from the McCracken report, but Justice McCracken does not say that the banning of corporate donations would be unconstitutional and, in fairness, nor did the Minister, unlike the Taoiseach. Any constitution that allows for freedom of association must follow the consequences and allow people who freely associate to donate to the union, club or party in which they are freely entitled to associate. We addressed that in the Bill. If the Taoiseach has legal advice to the effect that the banning of corporate donations would be unconstitutional, and that is the sole position Fianna Fáil is adopting at present, that advice should be published. We do not believe he has such advice because we do not believe any serious lawyer, certainly not the present Attorney General, would furnish such advice.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, to whom the Minister must give his allegiance as a loyal member of Fianna Fáil, is fundamentally committed to corporate donations as a permanent part of the political landscape. However, the lessons coming from the tribunals are such that if corporate donations continue in the form the Minister is purporting to regulate, in amounts of £20,000 per year, that will confirm the corruption of the process of Irish politics as it is perceived by so many people. We are the most openly traded country and most dependent upon international perceptions of how we do our business. The perception of corruption, which the Minister wants to institutionalise in legislation through corporate funding, will be seriously damaging not only to the prospects of Fianna Fáil but to the fibre of this Republic.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Health Services: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Gay Mitchell on Tuesday, 27 February 2001:</P>
    <P Just="Center">That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's mismanagement of the health services despite the taxpayer contributing unprecedented levels of funding and in particular in its failure to:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;provide fair and equitable access to health services;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;reform the administration and governance of health services;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;make the structural and staffing changes necessary to eliminate hospital waiting lists;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;provide for current and future medical, nursing and therapist manpower needs;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;provide additional hospital beds;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;relieve the chronic overcrowding in hospital accident and emergency departments;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;make proper and timely investment in primary care;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;provide medical cards for those on modest incomes;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;develop and provide positive mental health programmes;</P>
    <P Just="Center">and calls on the Government to immediately address these deficiencies and in particular to ensure:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the appointment of a health ombudsman;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the creation of a covenant of rights and responsibilities for patients and health care providers, overseen by the health ombudsman;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the provision of adequate support services to allow older people to live in dignity and independence in the community; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the setting up of an independent inspectorate of both private and public nursing homes</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="534" /> Amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P Just="Center">To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;&ldquo;commends the Government on its commitment to provide a high quality health service directed at those most in need and acknowledges:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the dramatic increases in current funding since 1997 to the health services made by the Government compared to the previous Administration;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the provision under the national development plan of £2 billion in capital funding which will transform the health infrastructure;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the Government's strategic approach to planning for the health system, in particular the launching of significant major strategies, such as the children's strategy, the cardiovascular strategy and the national health promotion strategy;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the Government's strategic and reforming approach in regard to the work now under way in areas like the reform of the medical structure advocated in the report of the Forum on Medical Manpower, the review of bed capacity in the acute hospitals and the pending review of primary health care;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ndash;the Government's commitment to the preparation of a new health strategy which will make recommendations on how best to implement a high quality, equitable and accessible health service; and</P>
    <P Just="Center">supports the Government in its approach to modernising the health system through the development and implementation of strategies underpinned by solid investment.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Noting that the tax year 2001 is of 38 weeks duration and noting that tax allowances are allowable at a 74 per cent of the normal annual rate, that the Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the impact of section 8 on tax payers who will no longer be entitled to receive the PRSI &lsquo;tax holiday' in this tax year.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the PRSI holiday, as it is known. People pay PRSI contributions to the social insurance fund. There is a ceiling for employees above which they do not any more PRSI. The ceiling for the tax year 2000-01 is £26,500 and the Minister announced in the budget that for the tax year April to December 2001 the ceiling will be £28,250.</P>
      <P>On the face of it one might say the ceiling is increasing slowly, as it has done every year. It will probably increase again this year. However, that is not the case. Last year, people paid the normal taxes they were required to pay and their PRSI. The tax year April to December 2001 is a short tax year of 38 weeks duration so a total of 74% of the various allowances are allowable against one's tax liability. The personal allowances &ndash; the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, reminds us they are now credits &ndash; are allowable at a 74% rating so everything is reduced by 74%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministers, including Deputy Dermot Ahern and Deputy McCreevy, emphasised in their contributions on the budget that they were returning tax to the people. People would pay less tax than they paid last year and everything in the garden was rosy. However, look at the small print. What has happened to the PRSI ceiling? Nothing. One would have expected the PRSI ceiling to be reduced to 74% like the other allowances but that has not happened. <Col N="538" /> That is a major failure on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the figure given by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in correspondence about this issue. The figure of 304,000 people was given by the Minister for Finance not long ago and I accept that. A total of 304,000 people are expected to reach the PRSI ceiling in this tax year. That means they had income in excess of £26,500. They paid PRSI on income up to that amount but when they reached it they stopped paying PRSI. Some of them are not paying PRSI at present. One would have expected that, in the coming tax year, April to December 2001, anybody who got a PRSI tax holiday during the previous tax year would also qualify for a PRSI tax holiday in this tax year. That seems reasonable. The Government spoke about reducing taxes and giving people back their money, so one would have expected that if one qualified for the PRSI holiday last year one would also qualify this year. However, that is not what the Government has done.</P>
    <P>The Government will take PRSI contributions from a large number of people who would have expected this PRSI holiday. According to the Government's figures, the number involved is about 200,000 people. Probably in excess of 200,000 people will pay PRSI over and above what they would have expected to pay.</P>
    <P>Why did the Government do this? The Government did so by sleight of hand as it wanted to gather additional revenue. The Minister will say I am talking about people on good salaries. These people are relatively well off. However, if the Government is talking about fairness and equity it should not impose additional taxes on people this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also tell me that these people will not lose out &ndash; that they have had a PRSI holiday in the tax year 2001 and they will have a similar holiday in 2002. I am not sure if the Minister is fully aware that in the tax year 2000-01 &ndash; April to April &ndash; these people will hit the PRSI ceiling and have a PRSI holiday in this part of the year. However, there is a shorter tax year from April to December of this year and most people will not get the PRSI holiday in that period. In the tax year 2001 we will be back to the same situation and they will qualify for a PRSI holiday.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say these people will get a PRSI holiday in 2001 and 2002. This is so but he is talking about three tax years rather than two. He is mixing up calendar years with tax years and that is not allowable and is unfair.</P>
    <P>The case has been made and has attracted media attention. This issue is affecting a large number of people and, in the interests of fairness, and if the Government is earnest in saying it is not taking more tax off people and people will have reduced tax liabilities in the coming tax year, then people should not have to pay additional PRSI which they would not have had to pay if the tax holiday was brought back to 74%.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong. If I understood him correctly he disproved his case by giving the periods of time. However, it is important to put on record that this amendment proposes that PRSI contributors are being disadvantaged as regards the employee annual ceiling which would apply in the transition tax year 2001. That is incorrect.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to clarify the situation and there is no gain to the State or no loss to the taxpayer as a result of these changes. Normally employees who have an annual earning in excess of the ceiling have a period referred to as the PRSI holiday at the end of the tax year where they do not make an employee contribution. In the case of a person earning £36,000 per annum, this period would run from mid January to 5 April in a normal year.</P>
      <P>In the transitional year 2001 this contributor will pay PRSI from April to December 2001 and continue to pay PRSI from 1 January 2002. He or she will have a PRSI holiday in the period October to December 2002. The overall effect is a delay in the commencement of the PRSI holiday period by nine months on an ongoing basis. There is no loss, it is only a delay in the period.</P>
      <P>This contributor will not lose out as a result of the alignment process. He or she will have two holiday periods &ndash; one in each of the calendar years 2001 and 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not tax years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>They are tax years because that is the change. The only change is the period when the holiday comes into effect. Overall all employees who pay at the main rate will gain as a result of the 0.5% reduction in the employee rate from 4.5% to 4%.</P>
      <P>There is no justification on the grounds of equity for a reduction in the PRSI annual earnings ceiling in 2001. Any such reduction would only benefit higher earners &ndash; 13% of all employees &ndash; and that is what the Deputy is proposing. That would be a gain if it was allowed but there is no loss to anyone.</P>
      <P>If a reduction of 26% was adopted, these contributors would pay less PRSI in the calendar year 2001, unlike all other contributors. This would represent a once-off gain to a relatively small number of high income earners.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that I am also making provision in the Bill so that no one will be disadvantaged with respect to entitlement to benefits as a result of the nine month short tax year. It follows, therefore, that it is also appropriate that PRSI contributors make the same contribution as they would ordinarily make in the nine month period from April to December of any year. A similar situation will apply to income tax and this is the purpose of the 74% reduction in tax allowances. Employee PRSI is not an allowance and, therefore, there is no necessity to reduce it. To do so would be unfair to the vast majority of contributors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employee PRSI is payable on a non-cumulat<Col N="540" /> ive weekly basis up to an annual earnings ceiling. The Bill provides for reductions to 74% of normal income in the minimum amounts of PRSI payable by certain low income contributors. This includes the self-employed, voluntary and optional contributors. These reductions reflect the fact that the income of these persons will be approximately 74% of normal in 2001. Similarly employees will receive approximately 74% of their normal PRSI free allowance in 2001. It is not necessary to legislate for this as these allowances are only available on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>The situation in respect of the ceiling is different. Persons normally earning below the ceiling over a 52 week period will pay less PRSI each week in the short year 2001 &ndash; 38 weeks in the case of most weekly paid employees. All these persons will then be awarded an extra 14 contributions to bring their annual record up to 52 contributions. The 14 contributions are effectively free contributions and can be used in due course to qualify for benefits.</P>
    <P>In 2001, persons normally earning more than £36,655 in a full 52 week year will have earnings in excess of the £28,250 ceiling. Accordingly, they will have a period in the 2001 short year in which they will have a holiday. This will be the same period in which they would have a holiday up to December of each year. They will also have 14 contributions added to their record and would normally have had a holiday for the period January to March 2002. This is now postponed from October to December 2002. That is the net effect of what we are doing. It is a question of timing and there is no gain or loss to anyone.</P>
    <P>Persons normally earning between £28,250 and £36,655 in a full year will also have earnings below the ceiling in the 2001 short tax year. They will pay PRSI as normal in each week up to December 2001 and 14 extra contributions will be credited. They would normally have had a holiday for part of the period from January 2002 to March 2002. This is now postponed to the relevant part of the period from October to December 2002. The reduction in the ceiling which I think is being proposed by the Deputy, would award a once-off gain to those high earners, as I have mentioned in relation to those with 38 weeks in a normal short year, and the other people earning over £36,000. The Deputy's suggestion that a 74% ceiling should apply would mean that a relatively small group, 13% of all employees, would have an extra bonus of up to £7,345 of income free PRSI. This should be contrasted with a worker on average industrial earnings who would pay PRSI each week in 2001 as normal. In other words, the Deputy is maintaining that the average worker should continue to pay the normal amount of PRSI each week in 2001, while higher earners should be exempted, through artificial means, from paying the same amounts of PRSI as they would normally do each week during the period April to December 2001. I am putting all this on the record so that it can be examined by the Deputy. I did ask him to dis<Col N="541" /> cuss this matter with my officials but I am not sure if he did so. The offer is there if he wants to discuss it with my officials.</P>

      <P>All contributors, be they low, middle or higher earners, will be fully protected from a benefit point of view if and when they come to make their claims in due course. It would appear that the Deputy is not committed to the underlying social solidarity aspect of the social insurance system and wishes to give once off monetary gains to those more fortunate in society while ignoring the average worker.</P>
      <P>All that is happening here is a postponement or delay in the PRSI holiday by six months, on an ongoing basis. The contributor will not lose out as a result of this alignment. He or she will have two holiday periods in each of the calendar years 2001 and 2002. The only change is the period when the holiday comes into effect. I can say no more than that, so the Deputy and I will have to agree to differ. If he can come up with some other expert evidence to suggest that people are losing out as a result of this, I will stand corrected.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should stick to the script. He has inadvertently misled the House again. On Monday I was discussing this issue with my daughter. She had seen the piece that appeared in the paper and said: &ldquo;I know what you are talking about now because when I got my wages I do not pay any PRSI now. I have gone over £26,500&rdquo;. That happened this week. If the PRSI holiday is based on a calendar year, how could anybody have a PRSI holiday in the month of March? It is based on a tax year from April to April. That is why this PRSI holiday kicks in in the period at the end of the tax year. I am afraid the Minister does not fully understand it but that is all right, he will not make the decision anyhow.</P>
      <P>When he says the tax holiday for 2001 will be postponed to 2002, that demonstrates clearly that he does not understand it because 2002 is a totally different tax year. It is an individual tax year starting in January and any PRSI holiday cannot be carried over into a new tax year. For PRSI purposes, one must start from base, going from zero and building up. The PRSI holiday in 2002 will occur at the back end of the year &ndash; in October, November and December.</P>
      <P>The Minister also got another point wrong. He asked whether it was fair that ordinary PAYE workers should pay PRSI for 12 months of the year while some privileged people will not pay for 12 months. That is the system the Minister has at the moment. Where does this PRSI holiday come in at the moment? It comes in because the better paid do not have to pay above the ceiling. The Minister is saying that system is wrong, yet he keeps it going year after year. He is perpetuating it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying it is not fair this year, but he has had that system in place all the time. Those are the facts. The Minister also said that well off earners could not get a PRSI holiday in this tax year, but some of them will at the back end of this year, in November and December, depending on their income. As soon <Col N="543" /> as their income hits £28,250 they will get a PRSI holiday. The very well off will get that.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that, according to the provisions in section 28, self-employed and other voluntary contributions should be reduced to 74%. If the Minister is reducing those contributions to 74%, why does he not also reduce the others?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report considering the implications of:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) increasing the respite care grant to £1,000 to all carers including those who are excluded by virtue of a means test, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) removing the disqualification, whereby carers in receipt of social welfare <Col N="544" /> payments are excluded from qualifying for a carer's allowance in special circumstances.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the short period left, I wish to deal with the issue of carers. If one group of people are rightly annoyed at the poor treatment they received in the budget and in this Bill it is the carers. Despite all the pomp and arrogance the Minister displayed on this issue, both in this House and on Committee Stage, he has not given way to a substantial increase in the carer's allowance structure and particularly in the respite care grant. My party has adopted a consistent position on this matter which we outlined in our submission last November. We are specifically seeking two things. Respite care grant should be increased to £1,000 for all carers, including those who have been excluded by virtue of the means test. Second the entire disqualification system, as currently applied, is unfair. It excludes a whole section of people who are carers on a 24 hour, seven day a week basis, without any recognition from the State.</P>
    <P>This is a huge constituency of people who will be up in arms whenever the next election is called. Despite the kind of patronising response from the Minister's Department so far, in terms of assessing the number of people who are in this category, he knows and we know that more than 100,000 persons within the category of carers are getting precious little help from the State. As the Minister has repeated a number of points in the course of the debate, I also repeat that the Government has at its disposal an unprecedented £6.1 billion Exchequer surplus this year. Surely, the range of areas to be supported should particularly include the less well off.</P>
    <P>Carers are a classic example of a sector which needs our support. Yet, after four years in office and despite all the announcements made by the Minister from time to time, we have not seen any noteworthy improvement in this area. Yes, another three or four thousand people will be in the scheme this year. So what, when one considers that there are some 110,000 people in this group? This Fine Gael amendment and the related Labour Party amendments, should be central to this debate. Even at this late stage, the Bill should be amended to take care of that section of our people who have been so badly treated and let down by this arrogant Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that the debate on this Bill is to be guillotined. I know all the Sections are important but this group of amendments relates to perhaps the most heroic group of people in our society. Some representatives of carers were present earlier. It is only right that the House should vote on the issue, so that people will know where we stand in relation to carers. The forthcoming division is essentially a vote on the carers' issue and on the Minister's performance in that regard. The basic reality is that we do not have any proper provision for the <Col N="545" /> rights and needs of carers, either as a constitutional guarantee or by legislation. The Labour Party's proposed constitutional amendment on the issue was shot down by this Government.</P>
      <P>The very modest amendments which we are now discussing, would give a basic increase of £1,000 per carer in respite care grants. The Minister gave a miserly £100 this year. A major opportunity was missed to deal with one of the greatest needs of carers, namely to have some time to themselves, to get their own health needs assessed and to have some little respite from their caring routine of a 24 hour day, seven days a week.</P>
      <P>Since Committee stage, the Minister sent me another copy of the 1998 review on carers' allowance, to indicate the basis for his Department's estimate of 50,000 carers. Having studied it carefully, I still believe it grossly underestimates the situation. The Carers' Association's estimate of 120,000 is a more realistic figure, based on international comparisons across Europe and particularly with Britain. Yet, as a result of the Minister's action, we will now have just 17,000 people covered by carers' allowance and a couple of hundred by carers' benefit. The new 'disregards' of £125 and £250 which he introduced, may benefit another 5,000 or 6,000 people. Even on the Minister's figures, probably a significant majority of carers are still receiving no assistance, no respite grant such as these amendments called for and certainly no fundamental carers' allowance. That is a testimony to this Minister's failure.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 31 asked for some relaxation on the rule whereby, for example, a lone parent caring for a parent with great disability, could draw some portion of the carers' allowance, in addition to her other social welfare benefit. Once again, the Minister has refused to agree to that.</P>
      <P>The other major issues raised in the amendments, which we can only discuss very briefly in the limited time available, relate to the need for a continual-care payment and a cost-of-caring payment, on which the Government has absolutely refused to make any concession. The proposals by the Labour Party and by Fine Gael for a weekly payment of at least £25, have also been rejected by the Minister. The response to our amendments shows a fundamental failure on the part of this administration. Despite being in his Department for a term now approaching four years, he has lamentably failed this most vulnerable group for which he has responsibility. Was it not&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue and I thank the Minister for coming into the House at this late hour to reply.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to make a clear statement that he will ban all activities at open adventure centres in Ireland and extend that ban to schools or other groups of young people travelling to England, Scotland and Wales while the foot and mouth threat continues.</P>
      <P>I have had a number of representations from schools and parents of transition year students who had booked into the Delphi youth adventure centre at Leenane, County Galway. Although they will be unable to travel because of the foot and mouth threat and the plea by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, to schools not to go on non-essential trips because of the risk of spreading the disease, the centre remains open and is demanding payment if the premises are not utilised.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, young people utilise this important and high quality centre from as far south as west Cork or Kerry, Clare, all Connacht and along the Border area. One of the strongest representations I received was from the principal of the Royal School in Cavan, Mr. Ivan Bolton, who had 36 of his transition year students booked in at a cost of over £2,000. There are 230 pupils attending this school, of which 130 are boarders, many of whom come from rural areas along the Border from Mullyash, outside Castleblaney, County Monaghan, close to the South Armagh area, through Cavan and on to Leitrim, as well as from Longford and Meath.</P>
      <P>The management and parents of this hard pressed school had no other choice but to decide not to allow the class to travel last Monday morning where they would have been mixing with young people from other parts of the country on 300 acres of land. The Minister must say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, or refund those children for their loss.</P>
      <P>After some pressure and publicity the management of the Delphi adventure centre agreed to rearrange the visit within the next fortnight. Does the Minister believe the danger will be over by then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> Many schools have planned trips to England, Scotland and Wales. I know one Dublin school which booked to travel through England and Wales to get to mainland Europe. Their travel agent advised them that he will not travel. The young people, many with little money, will lose their £50 deposit. In national terms the money will not overtax the Government but if the Minister banned their activities they might be covered by insurance.</P>
    <P>There are 90 cases in the UK. We cannot let down our guard. We must use every means to minimise risk. Parents and teacher meetings have been cancelled. The secondary school and other management bodies have cancelled meetings as has the Teacher's Union of Ireland. Colleges like UCD have postponed open days. The IRFU refused to travel to Wales or England. The GAA and other sporting bodies have called off events at a great loss. Hotels, guest houses and other service industries have cancelled bookings. I pay tribute to all for their sacrifices.</P>
    <P>There are still some people ignoring Government advice. I learned at the weekend that Eircom do not use disinfectant at its premises and then staff travel to the Border area. The Health and Safety Authority's headquarters in Dublin does not have disinfectant out and its agents continue to visit meat factories and farms. Management did not give any instructions about disinfectant and some of them will travel to the UK next week. Waterways Ireland continued work in County Roscommon until 27 February. Lorries and machinery crossed land and brought earth out on to roads and it is to go on to other lands on 5 March.</P>
    <P>Customs Officers man the Border and know the road network. Can the Government explain why their knowledge and expertise was not central to monitoring the Border area? Then there might have been a ring of steel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to address this House to outline our Department's policy, in relation to the threat of foot and mouth disease. An outbreak of foot and mouth disease has the potential to cause enormous economic damage to our agriculture and food processing sectors. It would have far reaching implications for our export markets, which would permeate through the entire economy. The full commitment of the entire population is necessary if we are to succeed in our efforts to prevent the spread of the disease. This is a national issue, which has the potential to adversely effect the well being of everyone in the country, and our response individually and collectively must reflect the gravity of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly our Department issued a letter to the authorities of all primary and post primary schools, which details the recommended measures they should put in place to prevent an outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The measures recommended in that letter are based <Col N="551" /> on the advice that our Department has received from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>Along with the preventative disinfectant measures outlined in that letter, our Department also urged all schools to take on board the advice of our colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, regarding non-essential travel.</P>
    <P>Specifically, we recommend that the following activities be cancelled until further notice &ndash; school tours to Britain and Northern Ireland, including those using Britain as a land bridge tours and field trips within the country, all inter-school activities e.g. sporting, cultural and musical events, and all non-essential events, where they may involve bringing together people from farming communities e.g. parent teacher meetings, seminars, and information-enrolment sessions.</P>
    <P>In addition to issuing the letter to primary and post primary schools, our Department placed advertisements in all the national newspapers detailing recommended measures to be adopted by schools, third level institutions, further and higher education colleges and all educational institutions.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the Delphi centre, Leenane, County Galway. Today the centre laid off 40 staff because of cancelled bookings. Private arrangements between individuals or groups with any private sector service is a matter between them. It would not be in the interests of the Department or the House that I involve myself in them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to specific instances involving Eircom, the Health and Safety Authority and others not adhering to the Government's recommendations. I am shocked to hear that. I cannot understand it. I will have the matter investigated by my Government colleagues and not later than tomorrow we will confirm if this is the case.</P>
    <P>Regarding the involvement of customs and excise officers on the Border, they have a specific role and duty. Under Acts of the Oireachtas they have certain responsibilities and opportunities to engage in particular services at particular times. Both the Garda Síochána and the military authorities communicate with them about the Border. The customs and excise service is involved there.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that our Department will continue to closely liaise with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development on this matter. I appeal to all concerned to exercise civic responsibility in this extremely important matter, for the immediate and future economic sustainability of our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Kirk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Smuggling of livestock into this country has concerned us for some time. In the present cir<Col N="552" /> cumstances it is a particular worry. It has always been hard to get a handle on it. My colleague, Deputy Connaughton, repeatedly asked in the past 18 months if the Government had more exact knowledge of it than the rest of us. The answers he received were disingenuous. There were strong denials of a significant level of smuggling.</P>
    <P>A report today deserves attention. It involves a simple calculation. During January 104 consignments of sheep were exported from Great Britain to Northern Ireland for slaughter. They comprised 10,000 animals. Approximately 5,000 of them could be accounted for. Where did the rest go? It seems likely that they ended up in this jurisdiction. It is not yet possible to say where they ended up. Some may have gone to farms, others to slaughter houses.</P>
    <P>When such movement is taking place in peace time, so to speak, then we must be concerned, not just for the economic effects or the fraud aspect, but also for the dangers to the health of our animals. Since 21 February we have seen how serious that is.</P>
    <P>What does the Government think of the report? What weight does the Minister attach to it? Can he add any more information on the level of this activity? There were apparently 5,000 in January alone. What measures, if any, will the Government effect to avoid a repetition of it after the hoped for end of the present situation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dukes for the opportunity to briefly contribute to this debate tonight. It goes without saying that this is a current issue throughout the country. It is a particular concern in Louth where there is a control zone in an area north of Dundalk, adjoining the Border, and in close proximity to the Meigh area of south Armagh. This debate affords us the opportunity to express our gratitude to many people directly involved &ndash; the Garda, Army personnel, officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and many people who are helping in a voluntary capacity. The weather has been very cold and manning check-points has not been an easy job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should express our gratitude to the public at large who have shown a considerable amount of forbearance and goodwill towards the campaign to ensure that foot and mouth disease does not come into the Republic. That forbearance and goodwill will not last for an indefinite period. Frustration may set in, particularly among those who are not directly involved in the farming sector. Many people may say that we do not have the disease here, so precautions are not so necessary. While everything considered necessary within the control area will have to be attended to, it would be useful to advise the public of an indicative timescale with regard to the control boundary. A caveat would have to be added that if we were to have a problem, the matter would have to be reconsidered. It is reasonable to assume that the control area will be limited to the Border area. <Col N="553" /> At present, there is a line around the Ravensdale area which comes into Dundalk, and which leads to long queues of traffic as people move north and south.</P>
    <P>It is important that we preserve goodwill in relation to this issue as any breakdown would have serious repercussions and would make it more difficult for those at check-points. I hope to have another opportunity to deal with this tomorrow night when the House discusses the emergency legislation.  </P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachta a chuir an cheist seo tráthnóna. I appreciate the need to raise this point at this time of national crisis and I welcome the opportunity to explain the arrangements which operated until recently in relation to trade in lambs and sheep, particularly between Northern Ireland and the Republic. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has made a number of the points I am about to make in the House on previous occasions, but I am happy to reiterate them in the context of the current situation.</P>
      <P>I need hardly remind Deputies that as a member of the European Union, Ireland is obliged to operate within the rules of the Single Market. While for some member states this can be a mixed blessing, there is no doubt that from Ireland's point of view it has been of enormous benefit. Trade in agricultural produce is no exception to the general rule in relation to free trade. This means that it is not, in normal circumstances, possible to prohibit the free flow of trade in agricultural produce which is the subject of a common organisation of the market, from other member states.</P>
      <P>Animal health precautions are, however, taken. Under EU legislation, sheep being exported from other member states must be accompanied by EU veterinary certification and be assigned to a particular holding or slaughterhouse. A separate certificate applies to each of three categories; sheep for breeding, sheep for fattening and sheep for slaughter. Details of each consignment of animals imported are required to be sent in advance to the local Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development office in the county of destination through the EU animal notification system, ANIMO.</P>
      <P>Where trade with Northern Ireland is concerned, these requirements have, by bilateral arrangement, been removed since 1992 because, for the purposes of the sheep trade, both parts of this Island have the same health status. Under this arrangement, sheep of Northern Ireland origin may move freely into the Republic and <i>vice versa</i>. No animal health certificates are required for such trade and no ANIMO notifications are sent.</P>

    <P>All of this changed on 21 February after the confirmation of the first case of foot and mouth disease in Essex. My colleague, the Minister for <Col N="554" /> Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, announced a temporary ban on the importation of cattle, sheep, goats and pigs from the United Kingdom, including those from Northern Ireland. Since then both Army and Garda resources have been mobilised and 141 roads along the Border are manned. Controls are being rigorously enforced, and many of the calls received in my Department's call centre reflect a level of public frustration at the delays being experienced at the Border as a result of them. I appreciate people's frustration at being unable to complete their journeys in the normal timespan, but I think there is a general consensus that this is a small price to pay for preventing this dreadful virus from traversing our borders.</P>
    <P>I read a report in today's media suggesting that as many as 8,000 sheep which should have been slaughtered in Northern Ireland may have been smuggled across the Border in the past two months. This assumption appears to be made on the basis that authorities in the North cannot match their number of sheep slaughtered with the numbers imported from Great Britain. However, I would like to put the figures in context. Each year between 3 and 3.5 million sheep are slaughtered in the Republic and in the past two months approximately 300,000 sheep have been slaughtered in Irish slaughterhouses.</P>
    <P>The Department cannot account for events in other jurisdictions. Specific reports of smuggling are thoroughly investigated in conjunction with Garda authorities. There have been a number of very well publicised incidents of sheep having been imported from the North. The House will be aware that my Department has been tracing animals linked to Athleague, Kildare Chilling, Myshall in County Carlow, Claremorris in County Mayo and Castleblayney in County Monaghan. This work is continuing apace and, to date, there are no serious concerns in relation to animals connected with any of these incidents. As of this evening 573 herds are being investigated on a precautionary basis in this jurisdiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost three years have passed since I last debated the proposed Arranmore nursing care unit in the Dáil. On that occasion <Col N="555" /> the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, stated that he would look at the provision of services for the elderly on the island. Hopefully he will respond again this evening. After careful investigation and assessment, the North Western Health Board sanctioned an eight bed nursing respite unit for the island. The board's decision was warmly welcomed and appreciated by the inhabitants of the island as it was expected that work would commence on the project by August or September 2000. Since then, progress has been at a snail's pace. Many islanders are unhappy, anxious and concerned at the lack of significant development on the unit's provision.</P>
      <P>Arranmore Island, with a population of about 600, is the most populated island off the Donegal coast. There are two primary schools, a successful secondary school under the auspices of Donegal VEC and a resident priest, doctor and nurse. There is also a daily and efficient ferry service from Burtonport and a progressive and efficient island co-operative, known as Comharchumann Oileán Árainn Mhór Teoranta. A day service unit for the elderly was established on the island some years ago and provides an excellent service for senior citizens. Accommodation in the centre includes day rooms, kitchen, doctor's surgery, dental surgery, consulting rooms and accommodation for visiting health professionals. There is also an ambulance which provides day centre transport. The day centre is open during the week and caters for approximately 70 to 80 people. The centre is run by Arranmore Social Services Committee in co-operation with North Western Health Board and is providing an excellent service for the elderly of the island.</P>
      <P>When one analyses the demographic trends on Arranmore, the urgent need to provide a facility for elderly persons requiring nursing care becomes glaringly obvious. There are approximately 130 persons over the age of 65 living on the island. About 30 are more than 80 years of age. There are 35 to 40 persons over the age of 65 living alone, some of them house-bound or bed-bound. These figures illustrate the need for a nursing unit on the island.</P>
      <P>Island people become particularly attached to their island homes. The magical lure of the surrounding seas is an almost essential element in their lives. To transfer them from their island environment to nursing units on the mainland is unacceptable. Having been removed from lifelong friends, acquaintances and family to a foreign and, to them, often friendless environment leads to feelings of isolation. Visits from family and friends become sporadic and intermittent due to travel difficulties, and there is ample evidence that such an unacceptable situation shortens their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senior citizens in Arranmore Island are entitled to nursing care facilities on their own island where they can maintain contact with their own environment and lifelong friends. I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to expedite <Col N="556" /> the provision of the unit that has already been sanctioned for Arranmore Island. Mar fhocal scoir, a Cheann Comhairle, Arranmore Island is a Gaeltacht island. Oileán Gaeltachta é. Tá suas le 600 duine ina gcónaí ann. Tá oideachas maith á chur ar fáil do dhaltaí an oileáin ar bhunscoil agus ar iar-bhunscoil. Tá ionad lae ag freastal ar shean daoine ar an oileán ach is cinnte go bhfuil easnamh mór amháin ann, sé sin ionad banaltrais. Cé go bhfuil an t-ionad geallta le breis is bliain is beag an dul chun cinn atá déanta ó shin agus tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire Stáit brú a chur ar an bhord sláinte dul ar aghaidh leis na socruithe láithreach sa dóigh go mbeidh ionad banaltrais ar fáil ar an oileán gan mhoill. Go raibh maith agat a Cheann Chomhairle</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGinley for raising this issue on the Adjournment. The provision of health services to older people living on Arranmore Island is the responsibility of the North Western Health Board. In recent years, my Department has provided considerable additional revenue funding to the board to improve services to older people. This funding amounted to £2.2 million in 2000 and £3.8 million this year and the board was enabled to improve services both in the community and in hospitals. I mention, in particular, the opening of a new community nursing unit in Killybegs.</P>
      <P>At present, a day care unit is run on the island by the Arranmore Social Services Committee, in co-operation with the North Western Health Board. The board provides more than 90% of the funding. The day centre caters for approximately 80 older people, and services provided include the following: transport, meals, laundry, social activities, including crafts, games and leisure, GP and public health nurse services, baths, information and advice, library facilities, and other health service facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to recommendations of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development in 1996, the North Western Health Board set up an island review group to conduct a comprehensive review of health needs and service provision to island communities. The island review group recommended, in its service development plan, 1999, for Arranmore Island, the provision of a small nursing unit of six to eight beds. Several meetings took place between members of this committee, representatives of the island community, the resident GP and public health nurse. Architects were engaged and draft plans were produced in consultation with committee members and representatives of the island community for the provision of this unit. It is planned to develop the unit on the site of the existing health-day care centre. However, recommendations from the architects suggest that the present site will not accommodate a development of this size. The board is currently seeking to make contact with a private land owner who owns <Col N="557" /> land adjacent to the health-day care centre. Although the land owner, at present, lives outside the country, it is hoped contact will be made over the forthcoming weeks, with a view to purchasing the necessary land. A home-based carers support-respite scheme has been provided on the island since 1998. During 2000, 26 people were in receipt of this service, at an annual cost of £78,000. The scheme continues to be provided in 2001.</P>
    <P>Specific funding being made available to the North Western Health board to deliver a comprehensive capital programme, in the period 2001-06, inclusive, under the national development plan, includes a sum of more than £13 million in respect of services for older people. Progress on the Arranmore nursing unit will depend on its priority rating by the North Western Health Board, among the projects to be undertaken within the budget provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House at this late hour to take the debate on this very important issue.</P>
      <P>Nothing should be done to undermine the importance of keeping foot and mouth disease out of this State. To date, the responsible approach by members of the public to the advice on foot and mouth disease from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development must be commended. I sincerely hope people's patience and sense of responsibility does not wear thin. It is crucial that we remain steadfast in our fight to keep foot and mouth disease out of this State until we get the green light.</P>
      <P>In recent days it has become clear that the restrictions in place to prevent an outbreak of foot and mouth disease are beginning to have a negative consequence for many people. Apart from the farming sector, those working in sport and in the food industry have witnessed temporary job losses.</P>
      <P>A sector where restrictions on the movement of people is really hurting is the tourism industry. Tonight, many people in this House would have watched the RTE news feature on the difficulties facing the tourism industry. As long as the foot and mouth disease restrictions apply, the difficulties for this industry will persist and will get worse. The Irish Hotels Federation said tonight that up to 500 conferences are in jeopardy. Last weekend in Killarney a major SIPTU conference was cancelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism, like agriculture, is an important indigenous industry. Tourism and the catering sector account for our fastest growing industry. It is therefore crucial that a strategy be put in place to ensure that this industry is not seriously damaged over the coming weeks and months. The springtime is best described as the shoulder period, before the tourism season really takes off. A successful shoulder season is the difference between whether jobs in the industry will be seasonal or full-time. My constituency, South Kerry, <Col N="558" /> which is one of the tourism capitals, is already suffering major losses. One major hotel in the area has estimated that business lost to date as a result of the foot and mouth disease restrictions is worth in the region of £10,000. The cancellation of conferences, seminars and major events, which form the bread and butter for the tourism industry at this time of the year, have resulted in staff layoffs and instructions to staff to take holidays now. Many people running golf clubs, angling clubs, walking tours, heritage sites and much more have been temporarily laid off or are on compulsory holidays. While the staff have accepted this fate in the interests of the national economy, they will simply not accept, nor should they, a situation whereby the summer tourism season is also damaged. It is crucial that a strategy be put in place by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation. In addition, it is vital that a major campaign be put in place to sell our tourism industry post-foot and mouth disease crisis, to make good the losses now being encountered.</P>
    <P>Last summer the tourism industry outside Dublin was greatly damaged because of industrial action undertaken at Iarnród Éireann. Tourists abandoned plans to travel to places like Kerry, Cork and Galway because they were unsure of the availability of a rail service. It is critical, in the interests of sustaining operators in the tourism industry, that they have a good summer to make good last year's losses.</P>
    <P>The decision to cancel St. Patrick's day events has come as a great disappointment to organisers and participants, particularly those who were planning to travel from overseas. That the annual St. Patrick's day parade in Dublin will not take place means massive losses to the tourism industry. In the words of J. J. Kavanagh, chairman of the Coach Tourism and Transport Council, should the £3 billion tourism industry be allowed to disappear how and when will the situation be retrieved when the scare has passed?</P>
    <P>The tourism industry and all those who work in it need the Minister's assistance and support during this difficult time. I appeal to him to begin discussions with all concerned as it is a worrying time for everybody involved in the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Deputy has raised this issue as it gives us an opportunity to consider another sectoral aspect when dealing with this particularly dreadful disease. While on the one hand I regret the decision, on the other I am delighted that common sense has prevailed and the Cheltenham racing festival has been called off. The possibility of foot and mouth disease spreading to Ireland threatens the economic security and livelihoods not just of farmers and the agriculture and food sector but potentially of every citizen. Agriculture and livestock are of such vital importance to the economy that we have to be thorough in our efforts to make sure that the disease does not spread with disastrous consequences. A series of initiatives has already <Col N="559" /> been taken within the tourism and sports sectors to help reduce the danger of a spread of the disease. I outlined these in detail in my reply to a number of parliamentary questions on this subject yesterday.</P>
      <P>The implication of the foot and mouth scare for the tourism industry, which employs more than 150,000 people and brings more than £3 billion into the economy annually, will depend on the scale and duration of associated restrictions. If there is continued negative international publicity, travel restrictions and prolonged closure of certain key tourism attractions and facilities, it could have a significant impact on the level of business this year and in subsequent years, particularly from the British market which has been one of the main engines of tourism growth in recent years.</P>
      <P>I have arranged to meet tomorrow a delegation from the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, ITIC, which represents all sectors of the industry to discuss the potentially serious effects on tourism. I note from a press release issued by ITIC that it estimates overseas business could be down by 15-20% for the coming year, amounting to a loss in foreign revenue of £500 million. Apparently this does not include tourism earnings from the Northern Ireland and domestic markets. ITIC says that the decision to postpone the St. Patrick's Day events is threatening to lose the country more than 10,000 people in organised groups, with the attendant revenue, during what is now the single biggest event of the year for many in the industry. I also note media comments by the Irish Hotels Federation that some of its members are already experiencing an appreciable downturn in business arising from cancellation of bookings and events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is represented on the task force which convenes daily, under the chairmanship of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, to review measures to prevent the spread of the disease. In addition, a separate high level action group, chaired by Bord Fáilte and including key ITIC representatives, has been established to monitor the situation on a continuous basis. The objective is to be in a position to actively manage issues which are affecting tourism business already booked and to limit any medium to long-term damage to the industry's image and prospects overseas. I understand that the action group is examining a number of issues, including the establishment of a helpline to deal <Col N="560" /> with trade and consumer queries, clarifying the nature of restrictions to those who travel from the UK and ensuring that all tourism operators and enterprises are aware of the recommended preventative measures.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte is making a number of adjustments to its promotional and marketing programmes in response to the situation, including the rescheduling of inward media and familiarisation visits. In response to the call from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for the cancellation of all hunting, fishing, hill walking, etc., activities, Bord Fáilte has stepped down and suspended for the time being the promotion of holidays based on such activities in the British markets and is reviewing on a case by case basis such promotions in other markets. Allowing for the sense of disappointment in relation to the cancellation of certain events, we may at least consider ourselves fortunate that this situation did not arise during the middle of the peak tourism season in July or August. That is another reason I know everyone involved is anxious to play a full and active part in the national effort under way to prevent the spread of the disease. Against that background and the unfortunate but inevitable set-back to our efforts to attract early season tourist business, I assure the tourism industry that any promotional drive temporarily stood down will be resumed by Bord Fáilte with renewed vigour once we have the all clear. Before Christmas I launched the largest ever annual tourism marketing programme for 2001 involving joint expenditure by the tourism industry and Bord Fáilte of approximately £100 million.</P>
    <P>My Department and Bord Fáilte will keep the situation under review with a view to making appropriate adjustments to marketing and promotion activities planned for the year. Hopefully, our continuing progress in keeping the disease at bay could, in time, enable us to review the scope and nature of some preventative measures, including travel advice, cancellation of events and closure of tourism facilities and attractions. While we are clearly conscious of the imminent threat to agriculture, our objective must also be to ensure that no unnecessary medium to long-term damage is done to the tourism industry, which is so important in economic terms. The tourism industry has been performing exceptionally well in recent years. Let us hope that we can sustain that growth once this crisis has passed.</P>

    </P>
    <P>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods): I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 52 together.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication last week of &ldquo;A Study of Non-completion in Undergraduate University Courses&rdquo; which was undertaken by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, at the request of the Higher Education Authority. Immediately after receiving the report, I requested the Higher Education Authority to convene a national seminar involving both the educational institutions and the social partners. This seminar will provide an opportunity to explore the complex causes of attrition and to explore solutions and preventive measures, including the further development of tracking mechanisms.</P>
    <P>The report found an overall completion rate of 83% for all first-time entrants to university undergraduate courses in the academic year 1992-93. While the report recorded substantial variations in non-completion rates by institution and by field of study, an overall completion rate of 83% is high by international standards. The report recommends that a comprehensive research study be undertaken to examine a range of issues relating to completion in the universities. The aim of this study would be to identify factors which contribute to non-completion, the reasons for high drop-out rates in certain subject areas, issues facing students in their transition to third level education, and the individual student characteristics that can contribute to lack of success in a university. The Higher Education Authority has already indicated its intention to commission this qualitative research and is pursuing the matter.</P>
    <P>The report also concludes that a tracking mechanism is required to monitor third level students progress from entry through their coursework and through transfer to other courses and institutions. It notes that such a mechanism should provide for the identification of students who depart from third-level education. The report concludes that, although some institutions already have good tracking systems in place, there is a need to develop an inter-institutional tracking system. Preliminary steps are already under way to establish tracking mechanisms. The Higher Education Authority is developing an oracle-based data system to store detailed student-related data. This will facilitate the identification of cases where students fail to progress to the next year of a course. The report also recommends that each university should develop explicit policies on retention and I have requested the Higher Education Authority to review these policies within 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of the public service benchmarking body was agreed as an integral part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness arrangements on public service pay. It has been agreed between the Public Services Committee of ICTU and the Government employers that certain selected grades only shall be subject to detailed examination by the benchmarking body. The teaching grades to be examined include principal, deputy principal, assistant principal, special duties teacher and teacher in the primary and post-primary sectors. The public service benchmarking body has been asked to produce its report and recommendations by 30 June 2002. A single report is to be produced covering all grades, groups and categories within the benchmarking body's terms of reference.</P>
      <P>Benchmarking is basically about comparing public service pay and jobs with pay and jobs across the economy with a view to ensuring that public service pay rates compare favourably with comparable employment in the private sector. This was the objective of the Government and the public service unions in framing the benchmarking process and establishing the public service benchmarking body.</P>
      <P>Benchmarking is not about performance related pay. The benchmarking exercise involves much more than a pay review in the traditional sense. As well as examining pay rates, the benchmarking body will examine and compare existing roles, duties and responsibilities in the public service and across the economy. This is designed to ensure that it does not look simply at the pay rates applicable to jobs with similar titles but also looks at the jobs themselves to establish how comparable they are. In undertaking its research it also has to have regard to differences between the public service and the private sector, and between different groups in the public service, in working conditions, the way the work is organised, conditions of employment and other benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benchmarking body will examine the jobs as they exist and operate in practice. It will seek to compare them to similar jobs in the private sector and also compare the reward packages, pay and non-pay, applying to both. Benchmarking is about ensuring that the public service can compete fairly to recruit, retain and motivate its staff. The process should be seen not as setting the norm in the wider economy but rather ensuring that the pay rates in the public service are in line with those across the economy. The benchmarking body will be able to evaluate each case on its merits and on the basis of its research findings. In this way the work of the benchmarking body is similar to the exercise that has been carried out for many years by the review body on higher remuneration in the public service where, <Col N="564" /> for example, the pay of members of the Oireachtas and senior public servants has been compared to pay rates applying to similar jobs in the private sector.</P>
    <P>Arising from discussions with the benchmarking body, it has been agreed that the process will include written submissions by unions and employers, with both sides exchanging their submissions thereby giving an opportunity for comment by both sides on the position of the other. The body will arrange its own research programme and it is envisaged that there will be feedback from this to the parties. There will then be oral hearings attended by both sides. The submissions, research and the oral hearings will inform the benchmarking body's deliberations and they will recommend rates of pay for all of the groups. The public service benchmarking body has sought written submissions from management and trade unions by 20 March 2001 and is already in the process of arranging the appropriate research. It intends to hold oral hearings in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Although employers and unions will have to negotiate the how and when of implementation, they will not be renegotiating the recommendations themselves. However, an agreement reached between the Government and the trade unions in December 2000 provides for payment of 25% of any increase with effect from 1 December 2001. One of the essential features of this benchmarking process is that it will look at all of the key public service groups as part of one exercise and that there will be one comprehensive report. Previous history has shown the difficulty that arises from one group alone being singled out or when special claims are processed at different times in varying social and economic climates.</P>

      <P>There are 80 psychologists serving with the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. This reflects a welcome expansion as 30 of these have been appointed since the beginning of September 2000 as part of the Government's plan to expand the service . It is intended to appoint up to 20 more psychologists before the end of the school year. It is also intended to proceed with the recruitment of another 28 psychologists later this year. This will raise the staffing from 50 psychologists to some 128 and greatly improve the service.</P>
      <P>Most of the newly appointed psychologists have completed their induction programme and are being assigned to schools. The final list of additional schools that will now have access to NEPS is practically ready and visits to those schools will commence during the week beginning 12 March. As each additional psychologist is appointed, more schools will be added to the list. However, I recognise the need for some schools and parents to be able to gain access to psychological assessments in situations where a National Educational Psychological Service psychologist is not available to them. I have requested the management of NEPS to develop a set of proposals aimed at alleviating the situation, pending the time when it will have achieved its full staffing complement. These proposals have just been completed and are now being considered by my Department.</P>

      <P>The National Educational Psychological Service is being developed as a dedicated agency to provide an educational psychological service to all primary and post primary schools. This service currently employs 80 psychologists providing a service to all second level schools and approximately 725 primary schools. Some 30 of these psychologists have been appointed since the commencement of the school year as part of the Government's plan to expand this service. It is intended to appoint a further 20 psychologists to the service before the end of this school year and to proceed with the recruitment of another 28 psychologists later this year. This will raise the staffing from 50 psychologists to some 128 and greatly improve the service. It is envisaged that all first and second level schools will have access to the National Educational Psychological Service by the end of the 2003-04 school year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, in addition to the expansion of the National Educational Psychological Service to all schools on a nation-wide basis, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that measures are being included in the Finance Bill to provide tax relief to parents who find it necessary to engage the services of private educational psychologists. Consideration is also being given to the development of school-based testing measures which will provide a more efficient means of identifying some special needs without the need for recourse to full educational psychological assessments.</P>
      <P>Arising from a Government decision in October 1998 all children with special needs within the primary system are now entitled to an automatic response to their needs. As a result of this development, the number of resource teachers supporting special needs children in the primary system has increased from 104 to more than 750. The number of special needs assistants supporting special needs children has increased from less than 300 to more than 1,700 over the same period. Additional resource teachers and special needs assistants are being allocated by my Department on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children with special needs of second level age are generally catered for in ordinary second level schools with the support of the resource teacher and special needs assistant services. There are 273 resource teachers and 135 special needs assistants in the second level system. Where more serious <Col N="567" /> disabilities are involved, the children are catered for in a range of special schools and special classes dedicated to particular disabilities. All such facilities operate at reduced pupil-teacher ratios and attract special needs assistant support in line with the recommendations of the special education review committee. In addition, my Department makes funding available for the purchase of computer and other equipment for children with special needs. This year the amount of funding available in this area has been increased from £987,000 to £2,730,000. It is my intention to continue to build on these developments so as to ensure that all children with special needs receive the support they require when and where they require it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 87 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rate of progress on the programme of asbestos remediation in primary and post-primary schools has been steady since it began in 1999, taking into consideration that the testing and removal procedures are quite complex and have to be undertaken by specially qualified personnel in accordance with strictly enforced procedures. <Col N="568" /> By the end of 2001 approximately 2,000 out of a total of just under 4,000 schools will have been tested. Of those schools which have already been tested, approximately 500 were found to contain asbestos. Although the presence of the material did not constitute any immediate health and safety risk, it was decided as a matter of policy, when the remediation programme began, to have asbestos removed from schools where it was detected. The necessary removal works have been carried out in approximately 370 of these 500 schools and it is hoped to complete work on the remaining 130 buildings before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated at this point that the full programme of testing and removal in respect of all schools will be completed by the end of 2004. Where asbestos requiring removal is detected, either as a result of the survey or otherwise, arrangements are made to undertake the work in accordance with the relevant health and safety legislation. The entire cost of the programme of detection and removal is being borne by my Department. Total expenditure in 2000 was £6.3 million.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to make available the necessary finance to maintain the rate of progress. It is likely that expenditure this year will exceed the figure of £6.3 million for 2000 due to an increase in the number of schools being dealt with. Funding for the asbestos programme is provided from the annual capital allocations for primary and post primary schools. The capital allocation for 2001 in respect of school buildings is in excess of £220 million.</P>
    <P>I should point out, however, that the current foot and mouth crisis may require a temporary halt to the testing and removal process in rural schools and my Department and the Office of Public Works will continue to monitor the situation closely and take whatever precautionary measures are necessary.</P>

      <P>Following a Government decision in May 2000, approval was given for the establishment of a national maritime college in Ringaskiddy, County Cork, using the public-private partnership model. The national maritime college will accommodate the Department of Nautical Studies of the Cork Institute of Technology and the Naval College of the Irish Naval Service. Planning for the provision of the college is well under way in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following an advertisement in the Official Journal of the European Communities, OJEC, and in the national media, management consultants were recently appointed to support my <Col N="569" /> Department's public private partnership unit with the procurement of the project. In parallel with the process of appointing management consultants, an application for outline planning permission for the new college was submitted by the Cork Institute of Technology to Cork County Council in September 2000.</P>
    <P>A project board has been established comprising representatives of my Department's public-private partnership and planning and building units, Cork Institute of Technology, the Naval Service and the management consultants to oversee the implementation of the project.

      <P>The White Paper on early childhood education, Ready to Learn, sets out a comprehensive strategy for the development of early childhood education for all children aged from birth to six years. Following the publication of the White Paper, my Department carried out an extensive post-consultation process with all of those who made presentations to the National Forum for Early Childhood Education. The aim of these consultations was to seek the views of interested parties with regard to the implementation of the policies set out in the White Paper, on a phased basis, and to enable the necessary planning and preparatory work for implementation to be undertaken by my Department in line with the commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, my Department sought and received proposals from third level institutions for a pilot project to develop early childhood education provision in pursuance of the objectives in the White Paper. It is envisaged that the pilot project will include: the development of early education quality standards in relation to equipment and materials, staff qualifications, training, learning objectives, methodologies and curriculum; the development of a support framework to encourage compliance with quality standards by early education providers; the co-ordination and enhancement of early education provision with a particular focus on disadvantaged and special <Col N="570" /> needs groups; and the commissioning of a programme of research and development through which best practice in curriculum, teaching methodology and parent involvement may be implemented and evaluated.</P>
    <P>My Department is assessing the proposals and I hope to be in a position to make further announcements about future developments in early education area very shortly. The question of developing and funding initiatives for particular pre-school sectors will be considered by my Department in the context of the implementation of the White Paper and the proposed pilot project. Support will continue to be made available through existing programmes such as the early start and Rutland Street pre-school projects. In addition, the State may become involved in further direct provision in certain instances, where the educational needs of disadvantaged children or children with special needs are not being met by existing State-funded services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The post of school principal is of critical importance in the management of primary education. I appreciate that the many new developments in primary education in recent years have significantly increased the responsibilities of principal teachers, and all the indications are that the pace of change will continue in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the establishment of the Irish Primary Principals Network, which has the potential to provide additional professional support and development for primary school principals. In recognition of the onerous responsibilities associated with their positions, primary principal teachers receive allowances, which range from £4,886 to £15,205 per year, depending on the number of pupils enrolled in the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the PCW, significant numbers of additional middle management posts were created to improve the overall management <Col N="571" /> structure in primary schools. As a result, there are more than 8,000 teachers, excluding principals, holding posts of responsibility in primary schools as deputy principals, assistant principals and special duties teachers. These post holders are members of the management team of the school and are paid significant allowances in respect of their responsibilities. Accessibility to these additional management posts is likely to have had an influence on the numbers of teachers seeking posts as principal.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a principal teacher of a primary school is a matter for the board of management. While there are indications from the IPPN survey that the number of applicants for posts may have decreased in recent years, the issue must be examined in the context of recent developments. The Government has introduced a range of measures to improve conditions for principals, and further improvements will be implemented for the 2001-02 school year.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1 September 2000 administrative principals were appointed only to schools with eight or more mainstream class teachers. In the current school year, administrative principals may be appointed to schools with seven mainstream class teachers. In addition, schools with 11 or more teachers, including <i>ex quota</i> posts, may appoint an administrative principal. I will be implementing further improvements in this area for the 2001-02 school year. From September next, administrative principals may be appointed to all primary schools with six or more mainstream class teachers, or with ten teachers including <i>ex quota</i> posts.</P>
    <P>The introduction of release time for principals in primary schools with less than seven mainstream class teachers in the current school year is of major significance to school authorities and principals. The release time enables the teaching principal to be released for a specified number of days annually to undertake administrative, leadership and management functions in the school. Substitution cover paid for by my Department is provided for the days the principal is on release time. The number of release days is being increased significantly in this school year.</P>
    <P>My Department is formulating proposals for a comprehensive programme of professional development for principal teachers, including newly appointed principals. These proposals will be considered in due course in consultation with the education partners. Since taking office, the Government has created an additional 1,875 posts to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and to increase support for children with a disability or disadvantage. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government has approved the allocation of a further 900 posts to be allocated during the lifetime of the programme. In addition, resource posts are allocated to meet specific needs on an ongoing basis. The reduction in the PTR, and the increased support for children with a disability or disadvantage, will <Col N="572" /> continue to contribute significantly to improving conditions for principal teachers.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the need to improve the funding of secretaries and caretakers, the funding allocated by means of additional per capita grants to schools, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, has been increased this year to approximately £12.5 million and will be further increased in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million. This is a threefold increase in a two year period. These improvements mean that since September of last year all primary schools receive an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The introduction of these measures has also made a major contribution towards easing the workload of principal teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The school transport scheme was established in 1967. The scheme was basically designed to cater for children in rural areas, who, if living a long distance from school, might otherwise have difficulty in attending school regularly. I found that very little change had taken place in the scheme since its inception and I felt that this needed to be addressed. I am pleased to say that I was successful in obtaining an extra £2.85 million this year in order to permit a range of improvements to the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January last I announced major improvements to the scheme, which will significantly improve matters. These include the following. The qualifying distance for primary school pupils aged ten or over has been reduced from three miles to two miles so that all primary pupils will be treated equally for eligibility purposes. The number of eligible primary pupils required to establish a new school bus service has been reduced from ten to seven. There will be a reduction in the threshold for maintaining a service to four eligible pupils provided there is also a minimum of six fare-paying pupils using the service. The combined maximum daily travelling and waiting times for post-primary pupils will be reduced from three hours to two and a half hours. The distance requirement for primary pupils to qualify for remote area and scheme D grants will be reduced from three miles to two miles and the grants will be paid to each family. The qualifying distance for grant-aid for post-primary pupils residing remote from a school bus route will be reduced from three to two miles. The rate of grant payable is being increased and the question of two or more families sharing a grant will no longer arise. All school vehicles will have a communications system on board during the course of this school year. Arrangements will be <Col N="573" /> made for all buses to have first-aid kits on board by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I also decided to make provision whereby parents may, if they so wish, pay for extensions of bus services where feasible, having regard to time schedules and avoidance of major disruption to other pupils using the service. I also requested my Department, in co-operation with Bus Éireann, which operates the scheme on behalf of my Department, to carry out a thorough review regarding safety on school buses to be completed within three months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>Significant progress has been made by this Government over the past three years in eliminating substandard schools. Since taking office, this Government has made very substantial capital investment in the primary sector. For the year 2000, £81 million was allocated for primary school capital projects. This has been increased to £93 million for the current school year. This compares with only £19.5 million in 1993 and £34 million in 1997. Under, the National Development Plan 2000-2006 an unprecedented £413 million has been set aside for school infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Thirty-one of the 40 schools mentioned have been approved to proceed with necessary works and are already involved in the process. I have asked my officials to follow up with the remainder as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>My Department currently has more than 300 major projects at primary level in architectural planning. Major projects are those with an estimated value of £250,000 or more. In addition, approximately 900 applications for capital works in pre-architectural planning stages are being processed, including urgent projects in developing areas where there are no existing schools. While every effort is being made by my Department to expedite these projects it is a reality that architectural planning by its nature takes time and consequently there is a lead in time before replacement buildings are in place.</P>

    <P>My Department has noted from the INTO's press release that there appears to be evidence of vermin in some of the schools published. A prob<Col N="574" /> lem with vermin usually derives from an inadequate approach to hygiene and can occur in new and the most modern buildings if waste food and other debris is not properly disposed of. I am concerned about the incidence of vermin in some schools reported by the INTO. This is first and foremost a health and safety issue that should be addressed by each board of management locally. My Department will be writing to the schools concerned alerting them to the need for adequate measures to combat any vermin problem. Funding does not stand in the way of rectifying any problem with vermin. In the event that the Board of Management considers that some remedial work is necessary my Department will be pointing out that in addition to the capitation grants they may of course also use the funds already provided to them under the Department's minor works scheme.</P>
    <P>Primary schools are paid an annual grant under the devolved scheme of minor works to national school properties. The grant is intended to go towards improvements to school buildings and grounds and expenditure of the money is entirely at the discretion of the boards. In the year 2000, £14 million was allocated to this scheme. A similar amount will be allocated for the current school year.</P>
    <P>While I acknowledge that more remains to be done in the capital area, I remain committed to ensuring that the improvement of primary school accommodation will be accorded maximum priority.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to St. Michael's Remand and Assessment Centre, Kildonan Road, Finglas now known as the National Remand and Assessment Centre.</P>
      <P>The centre is certified as a place of detention and is used to cater for children remanded by the courts for short periods and for children remanded for assessment. I am aware that the centre experienced difficulties in the recent past in catering for children referred by the courts for assessment. These difficulties were related to the demand for placements at the centre, the condition of the buildings and in particular, the number of children with extreme behavioural problems who were being placed there by order of the High Court, while awaiting alternative placement. In this context, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on decisions of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> As a result of these difficulties, the centre was unable to carry out any assessments for a short period at the end of last year. This resulted in a backlog of cases and also created difficulties for the courts. The backlog has since been cleared. The centre is currently operating with ten assessment beds and a number of additional emergency remand beds.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the buildings occupied by the centre are not suitable for retention into the future. Planning is under way for the replacement of the entire facility and the construction of a new National Remand and Assessment facility with a capacity for 20 children. Architectural planning for the new facility is at an advanced stage and it is expected that tenders for the construction of the new facility will be invited this summer.</P>
    <P>An important development in the provision of assessment facilities has been the opening, in recent weeks, of a new project in Finglas village, which will provide a day assessment service for five children referred by the courts. This service is intended to provide an alternative to residential assessment for certain children and will result in a reduction of pressure on places.</P>
    <P>The measures now in train will help ensure that there are adequate places available to cater for children remanded for assessment by the courts.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools, that had available to it the report of a technical working group, represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post primary schools and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach.</P>
      <P>The recommendations made in the steering group's report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under continuing review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am aware of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, and it is my intention to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. The introduction of this support fund is a <Col N="576" /> significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion, in line with that available in relation to <i>per capita</i> grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. In addition, schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard per capita grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum, and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources. It is my intention that the recommendations of the steering group report on the funding of second level schools will inform policy on future school funding.</P>

      <P>When I became Minister for Education and Science, I set the tackling of educational disadvantage as a priority and it is my intention to provide additional resources at all levels of education to tackle educational disadvantage in all its manifestations. The new programme Giving Children An Even Break which I launched recently addresses educational disadvantage at primary level. Schools selected for support under the three-year programme were identified through a comprehensive independent survey of educational disadvantage in schools. The programme will cost some £26 million over the three-year period and involve the immediate creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to over 2,300 primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional teaching and funding resources being provided under the new programme must <Col N="577" /> be used for the provision of holistic supports for pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds. This is a key objective of the programme. Under the urban phase of the programme, I am committed to supporting schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantaged pupils in the maintenance of maximum class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes and 29:1 in senior classes over the three-year period. In rural areas, selected schools will have the services of a teacher-co-ordinator who will work in clusters of four or five schools. Prioritised schools that could not be clustered with other similar schools will receive financial supports as an alternative to teacher-co-ordinator support. In addition, all participating schools will receive additional funding to be used in the provision of a range of in school and out of schools supports for the pupils concerned.</P>
    <P>A programme of school and teacher support that will aim to maximise the benefits of the new programme for the targeted pupils will shortly be put in place. Teachers will be supported and developed to adapt their teaching styles and strategies so that their pupils will derive maximum benefit from the significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratios. Schools and their staffs, including new local co-ordinators, will be supported in the effective use of the new teaching supports and new financial allocation in providing enhanced services that meet the needs of at risk young people in school and out of school.</P>
    <P>The action I am now taking under the new programme will have a significant impact in addressing educational disadvantage in primary schools and will enhance the life chances of many young people who might not otherwise reach their true potential.</P>
    <P>The new programme will be subject to independent evaluation to ensure that the programme is meeting its objectives and to assist in its future development.</P>

      <P>The new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, costing £26 million over three years involves the creation of 204 new primary teacher posts and the allocation of substantial additional funding to participating schools. The effect of these additional resources will be to provide enhanced services for children from disadvantaged areas. An enhanced support structure is being put in place to assist teachers in putting the scheme into practice.</P>
      <P>The new programme was widely welcomed as a major contribution to tackling educational disadvantage. Nevertheless, a number of teachers have expressed some reservations about the package in relation to additional responsibilities falling upon schools.</P>
      <P>My Department had discussions with the INTO and the other partners in education well in advance of the launch of the new programme. Further discussions are being arranged with the INTO and school management organisations to provide any clarifications required and to facilitate the implementation of the programme.</P>
      <P>In March 2000, my Department issued a circular to all primary schools advising them of the new programme and that a comprehensive survey of educational disadvantage in schools would be undertaken by the Educational Research Centre in the near future. The ERC issued a questionnaire together with relevant instructions to primary schools in April and this was followed up by a further letter to schools in May requesting them to submit their completed questionnaires. Participation in the survey was not obligatory and over 75% of schools completed and returned questionnaires.</P>
      <P>All normal procedures were followed to ensure that information concerning the programme reached all primary schools. Where a survey return was not received from schools, it is open to them to make a submission to me outlining their circumstances in relation to educational disadvantage. These submissions will be referred to the ERC for consideration. The situation of these schools will then be further considered.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has published the Children Bill, 1999, which is currently in Committee. In addition to updating the provisions relating to young persons who have been sentenced by the courts and the obligations of the centres under the aegis of my Department, the legislation will provide for a wide range of early interventions and non-custodial alternatives to cater for children coming into conflict with the law or with serious care needs.</P>
    <P>Development plans have been drawn up by my Department to meet obligations that will arise under the new legislation. These plans provide for: major refurbishment and updating of the existing facilities at Trinity House, Lusk, which is the only secure provision for juvenile offenders in the State and of St. Laurence's, Finglas; the phased replacement of the existing outdated facilities at St. Michael's, Finglas and Oberstown boys' and girls' centres; the development of new pre-release units to serve the Finglas and Lusk centres; the development of a new highly specialised secure unit at the Lusk campus.</P>
    <P>In total, the development plans envisage an overall increase of 30 places in the level of provision currently available for young offenders. The plans will cost in excess of £25 million and will be completed over the next four to five years. I am satisfied that the number of places envisaged will ensure that there are adequate places available for children remanded or sentenced by the courts.</P>
    <P>Matters relating to the recruitment of staff are the responsibility of the management authority in each of the centres. My Department gives a staffing allocation to each centre and posts are filled as and when they become vacant.

A relatively small number of primary schools are shared between two or more centres.</P>

      <P>Two studies of non-completion in third level institutions have recently been completed by the Educational Research Centre. The report relating to the university sector, a study of non-completion in undergraduate university courses, was published last week by the Higher Education Authority. A parallel report, commissioned by the Council of Directors of the Institutes of Technology is also available.</P>
      <P>The reports outline the extent of non-completion in third level institutions and highlight variation by gender, institution and field of study. However, they do not provide data on non-completion by category of student, including mature students.</P>
      <P>The reports recommend that comprehensive research should be undertaken to examine a range of issues relating to completion in the universities. The aim of this research would be to identify factors which contribute to non-completion and the reasons why students do not complete their courses. These studies will also enable the identification of appropriate preventive action. I would anticipate that the research will also indicate whether non-completion rates for mature students differ significantly from the overall non-completion rate.</P>
      <P>Limited information is available in a further report, No Room for Adults  &ndash; A study of Mature Students in University College Dublin, published in 1999, which indicated a drop-out rate among mature students in the university of 31%.</P>

      <P>As is the case in relation to the provision of teacher training generally, my Department must be concerned to ensure that the maximum <Col N="581" /> benefits are gained from the training resources provided. The provision of training on demand would be unlikely to provide an optimal use of these resources. One important factor in this context is that the teachers will remain in their posts as long as possible following their training period. In the area of learning support, remedial, and resource teaching, the general requirement is that teachers must firstly be serving in these capacities.</P>
      <P>In addition to the major courses run in the universities and colleges of education for learning support and resource teachers, my Department also supports many shorter courses provided through the network of education centres, teachers organisations and summer courses for primary teachers.</P>
      <P>Guidelines for learning support teachers have issued to schools. They deal comprehensively with the teaching of children with difficulties in the areas of mathematics and reading. An intensive training programme based on the guidelines is at an advanced stage of development.</P>
      <P>The existing full-time programmes of pre-service teacher training in the colleges of education contain elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with special needs. The training of teachers in addressing the particular difficulties in the areas of mathematics and reading will continue to be given attention. In this context, the report of the expert group set up to examine pre-service training programmes for primary teachers, and with a requirement to have regard to developments in relation to children with special needs, is due to be completed shortly.</P>
      <P>I also established a task force last October to examine educational provision for children with dyslexia. I expect to have the report and recommendations of the task force shortly. Classroom teachers in primary and post-primary schools, in consultation with learning support teachers, have the lead responsibility for the identification and remediation of specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia.</P>
      <P>My Department has supported courses in learning support education for many years. Since 1994, there has been a national programme of training for learning support teachers. At present, post-graduate courses for teachers at primary and post-primary levels are held in six centres in universities and in colleges of education. In the current academic year 102 primary teachers and 72 post-primary teachers are attending these courses.</P>
      <P>These courses in learning support education are funded by the in-career development unit of my Department. The syllabus includes training in the diagnosis and identification of reading difficulties and in appropriate techniques for remediation. In particular, there is a focus on the problem of specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia, in relation to diagnosis and pedagogy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many shorter courses for learning support <Col N="582" /> teachers and other interested teachers in specific learning difficulties have been supported financially by my Department. They have been mainly provided through the network of education centres, through teachers' organisations and through the programme of summer courses for primary teachers.</P>
    <P>Resource courses are provided for primary teachers at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra; Mary Immaculate College Limerick-St. Angela's College Sligo and for post primary teachers in the Church of Ireland College of Education Rathmines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme - VTOS &ndash; was established in 1989 with the objective of providing second-chance education and training opportunities for unemployed adults over the age of 21 and in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months. Participants in VTOS cease to receive unemployment payments and are paid training allowances of at least an equivalent amount. They are also paid travelling expenses, where they reside three miles from the centre, and a meal allowance in line with those payable by FÁS.</P>
      <P>Approximately 5,000 people participate annually in the vocational training opportunities scheme at an annual cost to the State of £32 million. The scheme has proved successful in opening up learning and progression opportunities for people who have been marginalised by unemployment. For each of the years 1994 to 2000, the percentage of participants who completed the programme and who progressed to work or further education was 70% or more.</P>
      <P>The funding referred to in the questions is the grant paid by my Department to vocational education committees for expenditure on such items as light, heat, rent, books and equipment and other general expenses. The rate of the grant is £15,000 per core group of 20 VTOS students. It has not been found possible to increase this rate in the current year.</P>
      <P>However, improvements have been made in the resources available for VTOS students. A training bonus of £25 per week was introduced in September 1999 for participants who were registered as long-term unemployed prior to starting their programme, i.e. 12 months, as an incentive to encourage greater participation of the long-term unemployed in education and training programmes.</P>
      <P>A scheme of grants for child care for VTOS students was introduced in 1998 to facilitate the attendance of people who would otherwise be prevented from doing so by child care responsibilities. An adult educational guidance service has been initiated on a pilot basis, and a new management structure has been developed for the VTOS programme.</P>
      <P>The development of VTOS features strongly in the back to education initiative, as set out in the recent White Paper on Adult Education &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo;. Under this measure, £1.027 billion will be provided under the national development plan over the period of the plan for the development of a number of programmes, including VTOS, which will involve a significant expansion of part-time options. The resources for the programme will be examined in that context.</P>

      <P>A breakdown of the current staffing complement of my Department is set out in the following table. The total excludes staff assigned to the National Educational Psychological Service Agency and the National Council for Educational Awards. The range of responsibilities of staff reflects the functions of the Department as outlined in the statement of strategy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Mr. Sean Cromien's report on my Department's operations, systems and staffing needs reflected very clearly and starkly the difficulties faced by my Department in delivering quality services in a highly challenging environment. A high level task force within my Department is preparing a blueprint for implementation of Mr. Cromien's recommendations and I expect to be in a position shortly to bring proposals to Cabinet for significant departmental structural and service delivery reforms.</P>

      <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, provides for the establishment of a national educational welfare board and a nationwide educational welfare service with a view to ensuring that each child attends a recognised school on a regular basis or otherwise receives an adequate level of education. Nominations to the board have been received from the education partners and relevant Government Departments with <Col N="591" /> whom consultation is required under the legislation and I hope to be in a position to establish the board very shortly.</P>

      <P>A planning group was established by my Department to consider proposals for the development of a national centre of excellence for the visually impaired. The group, which reported to me and to the Minister for Health and Children in September 2000, has put forward a comprehensive range of proposals for the development of a national centre at Drumcondra, Dublin. The national centre would deliver a comprehensive range of professional support service for the visually impaired from pre-school level to young adulthood. The services in question would be available to all pupils on the Drumcondra campus and on an outreach basis to students with visual impairment throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Religious Sisters of Charity were represented on the planning group and participated fully in its deliberations. The group estimated the capital costs of its proposals at up to £12.7 million. The projected staffing costs have been estimated at £1.5 million. I assure the Deputy of my commitment to ensuring that adequate educational support services are made available to all students with visual impairment. My commitment in this regard is reflected in the fact that I have secured additional funding of £500,000 in the current year to facilitate the appointment of additional staff at the existing schools for the visually impaired at Drumcondra. However, the Deputy will appreciate that the recommendations brought forward by the planning group involve a range of complex issues which require very careful consideration. The proposals in question are being considered in my Department and I expect to make an announcement on these matters in the near future. The issue of contributing towards the costs of the proposed centre is a matter for the Religious Sisters of Charity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The schools IT 2000 project was launched in November 1997 and, to the end of the year 2000, more than £40 million had been invested by the State in implementing the project. Some £20 million in additional funding was provided by the private sector.</P>
      <P>The overall aim of schools IT 2000 is to ensure that pupils in every school have the opportunity to achieve computer and Internet literacy and to equip themselves for participation in the information society. To this end, grants issued to all schools, excluding further education colleges and schools not recognised for grant purposes under the free education scheme, to build up their technology infrastructure, a comprehensive teacher training programme in ICTs was provided and support services were established.</P>
      <P>A survey carried out for my Department indicates that, to date there are approximately 56,000 multimedia computers in Irish first and second-level schools &ndash; an increase of 65% since 1998; 75% of teachers have taken ICT skills training courses; the ratio of pupils to computers has fallen to 17.7 to 1 at first level and 13 to 1 at second level; all schools have been provided with an Internet connection and over 90% of schools have used e-mail; 78% of second-level schools and 18% of first level schools have local area networks; 69% of second level schools have an ISDN connection and 62% have multi-user Internet access and 46% of second level schools and 15% of first level schools have websites.</P>
      <P>In addition in first level schools there has been a significant increase in the use of ICT in the curriculum. This is especially so in English, other modern languages, learning support and mathematics; approximately 400 schools are participating in 70 innovative ICT projects under the schools integration project (SIP). The outcome of these projects is being evaluated and will be disseminated to assist in development of best practice not only in Ireland but further afield; and special funding was made available for pupils with special needs in recognition of the special benefits they have been shown to derive from use of ICT in their education and further dedicated funding of £1.75 million is being made available for this area in 2001.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of £81 million &ndash; £60 million in capital and £21 million in current expenditure &ndash; over the three years 2000-02 was announced in November 1999. Most of the £7.1 million in current expenditure allocated for 2000 was spent on continued activities under the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review and evaluation of the first three years of schools IT 2000 was undertaken in 2000 to enable priorities for expenditure in the future to be identified. Pending completion of that review, the capital element of the additional funding, £20 <Col N="593" /> million per annum, was rescheduled to cover the years 2001-03.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department. The compilation of this information would involve an inordinate amount of staff time. The general position is that my Department currently has more than 300 major projects in architectural planning. Major projects are those with an estimated value of £250,000 or more. In addition, approximately 900 applications for capital works in pre-architectural planning stages are being processed, including urgent projects in developing areas where there are no existing schools.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, hugely significant progress has been made by this Government over the past three years in eliminating substandard schools. Should the Deputy require information on any particular projects, officials of my Department will be pleased to provide it.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, the Government has invested massively in capital projects for the primary sector. For the year 2000, £81 million was allocated for primary school capital projects. This has been increased to £93 million for the current school year. This compares with only £19.5 million in 1993 and £34 million in 1997. The figure for 1998 was £47.3 million and for 1999 £60.3 million. Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 an unprecedented £413 million has been set-aside for school infrastructure at primary level.</P>
      <P>In addition to these measures, an annual grant is paid to primary schools under the devolved scheme of minor works. The grant is intended to go towards improvements to school buildings and grounds and expenditure of the money is entirely at the discretion of the boards. In the year 2000, £14 million was allocated to this scheme. A similar amount will be allocated for the current school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the remedial and resource teacher services can be of valuable assistance to some children suffering educational disadvantage, the services in question are not exclusively targeted on disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The remedial teacher service, which is now available in all first and second level schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above, is focused on the needs of children who are functioning at or below the tenth percentile on standardised tests of literacy and numeracy. Such children can present within any group of pupils and are not confined to areas of disadvantage. The resource teacher service is focused on supporting children with disabilities who are attending school on a fully integrated basis. Such children can also present in any location and support from the resource teacher service is not confined to areas of disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Educational disadvantage can derive from a variety of factors which extend well beyond those addressed by the remedial or resource teacher service. I recently launched a major new initiative to address educational disadvantage at primary level. Schools participating in this programme, giving children an even break, are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted on disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports being provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. Eligible schools were identified through an independent survey of educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Almost 2,300 schools are eligible to benefit under the programme. Schools already targeted under the disadvantaged areas scheme and the breaking the cycle initiative will retain existing supports but may also be eligible for additional assistance under the new programme.</P>
      <P>There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Urban schools with the highest concentrations of pupils at risk will be supported where necessary through staff allocations to implement a maximum class size of 20:1 in junior classes and 29:1 in senior classes. Rural schools with the highest concentrations of pupils at risk will be allocated the services of a teacher/co-ordinator who will work in clusters of four or five schools. Rural schools which could not be clustered with other similar schools will receive financial supports as an alternative to teacher/co-ordinator support.</P>
      <P>All schools participating in the programme will also receive financial support for the delivery of targeted in-school and out of school actions. I am confident that this new initiative will have a major impact in combating educational disadvantage in our schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the training of special needs <Col N="595" /> assistants, planning is under way on the provision of in-career development to meet the training needs of those in the posts.

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Government has, since taking office, created an extra 1,875 teaching posts to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and increase support for children with a disability or disadvantage in primary schools. The pupil-teacher ratio has declined from 22.2 to 1 in the 1996-97 school year to 20.4 to 1 in the 1999-2000 school year. The PTR for the current school year is 19.6 to 1.</P>
      <P>The retention of posts arising from the demographic dividend in the current year, together with the creation of an additional 350 posts under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, will help to significantly further reduce the pupil-teacher ratio for the 2001-02 school year. Furthermore, under the programme, it is proposed to appoint an additional 550 primary teachers between the 2002-03 and 2003-04 school years.</P>

      <P>The planning group established to prepare proposals for a national educational psychological service recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, in its September 1998 report, that the Minister for Education and Science should establish a national <Col N="597" /> educational psychological service agency (NEPS), as an executive agency of his Department. The report also recommended that the agency would have an overall target number of 200 psychologists and 36 administrative/secretarial staff, and that this target should be achieved over a period of five years, beginning during the school year 1999/2000.</P>
      <P>The new NEPS agency as proposed came into existence on 1 September 1999 with the 42 psychologists already employed in the service. The recruitment of additional psychologists involved the organisation of a competition through the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission. Notwithstanding the time consuming nature of such competitions there are now 82 psychologists in NEPS and by the end of this school year there will be 100 psychologists in the service. It is also intended to proceed with the recruitment of a further 28 psychologists before the end of this calendar year. This will raise the staffing to 128 and greatly improve the service.</P>

      <P>An outbreak of foot and mouth disease has the potential to cause enormous economic damage to our agriculture and food processing sectors. It would have far reaching implications for our export markets which would permeate through the entire economy. The full commitment of the entire population is necessary if we are to succeed in our efforts to prevent the spread of the disease. This is a national issue which has the potential to adversely effect the well being of everyone in the country and our response must reflect the gravity of the situation.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, my Department has issued a letter of advice to the authorities of all primary and post primary schools which details the recommended measures that schools should put in place to prevent an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in this country. The measures recommended in that letter are based on the advice that my Department has received from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the report of the steering group on the funding of second level schools, that had available to it the report of a technical working group, represents a comprehensive review of the funding arrangements of post primary schools and is a valuable document in both its analysis and clarity of approach.</P>
      <P>The recommendations made in the steering group's report for the future funding arrangements of second level schools are under continuing review. At the core of the recommendations made for future funding arrangements are the principles of equity of treatment, transparency of funding structures and adequacy of funding levels. Although my priority is to focus on the issue of adequacy of funding, I am aware of the traditional anomalies that have evolved in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level, and it is my intention to bring greater uniformity and cohesion to this particular aspect of the funding of schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already shown my commitment in this regard by establishing the school services support fund. The introduction of this support fund is a significant initiative in the funding of our schools. A school with 500 pupils will now receive additional annual funding of £20 per pupil or £10,000, with a minimum payment for smaller schools of £4,000 per school. This fund will channel an additional £7 million to schools each year. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools are being given discretion in line with that available in relation to per capita grants as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. In addition, schools will benefit from a further increase in the standard per capita grant. The grant was increased to £184 from £177 last year. It was further increased by £8 from September last to £192 and will be significantly increased by £10 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general <Col N="599" /> expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is paid to disadvantaged schools, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000.</P>
    <P>My approach to date has clearly shown my commitment and determination to address the needs of schools. I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources. I wish to assure the Deputy that it is my intention that the recommendations of the steering group report on the funding of second level schools will inform policy on future school funding.</P>

      <P>My Department has held discussions with the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority regarding the possibility of expanding the output of qualified social workers from the university system. These discussions have centred on the findings in the report of the National Social Work Qualifications Board of July 2000 which provides baseline information on social work posts in Ireland, based on a survey of the position as at 1 September 1999. The probation and welfare services account for 12% of the totality of social work posts. The survey found there were not enough qualified social workers available to fill posts and that an increase in the number of graduates from professional social work courses would be required to meet future demand.</P>
      <P>The report outlines how any increase in training places is intrinsically linked to practice placement opportunities. Quality practice placements are at the core of social work training and constitute some 50% of course time. The report notes that there is a crisis in supply of practice placements due to a lack of formalised structures and resources. I understand that officials of the Department of Health and Children have been pursuing this issue in association with the National Social Work Qualifications Board.</P>
      <P>Proposals for increasing intake into the relevant courses at University College Dublin, University College Cork and Trinity College Dublin have been developed by the universities and these proposals are currently under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary schools' running costs have been traditionally met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants and the local contribution. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools which include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. The capitation grant has been increased substantially since this Government assumed office in 1997. It has been increased from £45 per pupil in 1997 to £75.50 per pupil this school year. In addition, a rate of £80 per pupil <Col N="603" /> will apply in the 2001-02 school year. This constitutes an increase of some 77% over that period.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, my Department has also provided grant assistance to schools to meet their running costs by means other than the traditional capitation grant. For instance, in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking assistance to schools, I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000 I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less.</P>
      <P>These improvements mean that for the first time all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and will further increase this year to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
      <P>In addition, almost 2,300 primary schools will receive supplementary grants for the next three years under the major new programme, &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo;, recently launched by me to address educational disadvantage. The amount of supplementary grant aid payable to each school at the rate of £50 per disadvantaged pupil is based on the levels of concentration of disadvantaged pupils in the school. These were identified through a comprehensive survey conducted on my Department's behalf by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, during 2000.</P>
      <P>Last year I introduced an annual physical education grant for all primary schools. Under the terms of this grant all schools designated as disadvantaged plus schools in the rural phase of the Breaking the Cycle scheme will receive an annual grant of £1,000 per school while all other schools will receive £500 per school.</P>
      <P>In addition to the ongoing annual commitments outlined above, my Department has also issued a number of other grants to schools over the past three years. These grants include a library grant in December 1998, a science grant and an infants grant in October 1999, a national reading initiative grant in December 1999, a visual arts grant in November 2000 and a curriculum (arts) grant in November 2000. The total value of these grants amounts to approximately £19.5 million.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate in light of the information supplied above that substantial improvements have been made to the level of grant aid that has been made available by this Government to primary schools to meet their day to day operating costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware from successive national English reading surveys of fifth class pupils in primary schools that about 10% of these pupils have serious reading difficulties. I have already expressed my deep interest in the area of literacy and I am determined to take steps to raise the standards of literacy among school children. My target is to reduce significantly the numbers with serious literacy problems.</P>
      <P>The national reading initiative which ran last year was a first step in my campaign to improve reading standards generally. Many activities and events were organised throughout the country to promote reading at all levels, including the supply of a library ticket to every student attending a primary or second level school.</P>
      <P>During 2000 all teachers received the revised primary curriculum and underwent significant training in the revised English curriculum. There is an increased emphasis in the English curriculum on raising literacy standards through the development of reading skills as part of a whole language process.</P>
      <P>The new leaving certificate English syllabus places particular emphasis on literacy and follows on from the revised junior certificate syllabus. Greater attention is given to comprehension and composition thereby enhancing the development of literacy skills.</P>
      <P>These curricular developments will be of significance in achieving my target of raising literacy standards generally and of reducing the number of schoolchildren with serious literacy problems.</P>
      <P>Another important measure taken in this regard is the provision of resources to facilitate schools in the early identification and diagnosis of pupils' reading difficulties. As a first step, I have already provided all schools with copies of the Drumcondra English Profiles. These instruments will be used in addition to standardised, norm-referenced tests to enable teachers to build up a profile of each pupil's strengths and weaknesses. The use of the profiles will enable teachers to plan reading, writing and language programmes to suit the individual needs of each pupil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also arranging that all primary classes from first to sixth will be supplied with standardised, norm-referenced tests of literacy. These will assist schools in the early identification of pupils with reading difficulties. Through their use each school will also be able to compare its own results with national norms. In their school plans, staffs of schools will be able to set improvement targets to be achieved within a stated timeframe. This measure should increase the numbers of pupils <Col N="605" /> who function in the higher achievement bands and reduce the number of pupils who function at a low level or who exhibit reading difficulties.</P>
    <P>This approach of building the capacity of schools to administer and, crucially, act upon assessments is the best means of proceeding and helping pupils to attain higher standards.</P>
    <P>During 2000, learning support guidelines were issued to all schools. These guidelines contain the most recent advice on best practice in helping children with difficulties to achieve success at school. Arrangements are being made at present for in-career development of all teachers at primary level, including the 1,480 learning support teachers, so that the strategies outlined in the guidelines can be implemented on a collaborative, whole school basis.</P>
    <P>Another important measure taken during 2000 was the establishment of the task force on dyslexia. The report of the task force will be available soon and I look forward to studying its recommendations with a view to their implementation.</P>
    <P>All of these measures should assist in tackling, in a significant way, the literacy difficulties among schoolchildren.</P>

      <P>The revised primary school curriculum (1999) includes a new curriculum for Irish. Of the 11 subjects on the primary curriculum, Irish is the only subject which has been totally rewritten. It reflects the most up-to-date methods on the teaching of Irish as a second language and places emphasis on the development of communication skills within a broad cultural context. The curriculum aims to cultivate Irish as a living language within the classroom, the school and the wider community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the primary curriculum support programme, a substantial in-service programme for primary teachers on the Irish curriculum began in September 2000 and will continue on a phased basis until June 2003. The aim of the programme is to further develop teachers' competence and confidence in using Irish as well as familiarising them with the most modern language teaching methods. It is anticipated that this work will be complemented by measures which will ensure that teachers have ongoing access to a range of initiatives to support them in their language teaching work in schools. The response of teachers to the curriculum has been very positive. They have indicated that both content and meth<Col N="606" /> odology are appropriate to the needs and interests of children in today's world.</P>
    <P>At second level, in order to cater for the wide range of needs among the cohort, Irish is offered at three levels for the junior certificate and the established leaving certificate: ardleibhéal, gnáthleibhéal and bonnleibhéal. Irish is taught as part of the leaving certificate applied course. The syllabi, like those in the modern European languages on the curriculum, cater for the development of the four language skills: listening, speaking, reading and writing. They seek to develop these in a balanced way in accordance with the educational needs of students at the different levels. The syllabi in Irish and in the modern European languages are underpinned by the same general principles. They involve approaches and methodologies that are accepted and employed by language teachers internationally. Ongoing in-service training has been made available to teachers in relation to the teaching methods and approaches involved in the syllabi in Irish at the various levels.</P>
    <P>Because of the many variables involved, one must be cautious in attempting to draw conclusions from statistical information relating to examination results. The student cohorts vary from year to year and from subject to subject. The test items used vary also. The special working group on Irish, which was set up in 1999 to look into the performance of candidates in junior certificate, has submitted an interim report on its work to date. The group's analysis states that results in junior certificate Irish in the years under consideration are not out of line with results obtained in a wide range of junior certificate subjects. Results obtained in Irish in the leaving certificate in recent years are broadly in line with result patterns in modern European languages.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the revised syllabi in Irish for junior certificate and leaving certificate, there has been an appreciable increase in the numbers of candidates taking those examinations at the higher level by comparison with the former intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>In line with its statutory function of keeping the school curricula under review, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has initiated a wide-ranging review of Irish at second level.</P>
    <P>I am now establishing a body of persons as provided for in section 31 of the Education Act, 1998. That body will engage in research and planning and provide advice in relation to the teaching of Irish and to teaching through the medium of Irish. I hope to be in a position to make an announcement about this shortly.</P>
    <P>I am strongly committed to doing all that is necessary to ensure that our young people are motivated to learn Irish and that it is presented to them in a way that is in line with international best practice in language teaching.</P>

      <P>The criteria used to prioritise works include an analysis of the fundamental rationale or reason(s) for the works, an assessment of the likely consequences of not undertaking the works, the urgency of the works, the necessary time-scale for completion of the works, and the absence of alternative solutions.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to ensure that all capital projects are processed as quickly as possible. However, the Deputy will appreciate that there are inherent delays within this process. Specifically, the identification and acquisition of a suitable site tends to be a protracted process. The process of advertising and appointing a design team pursuant to EU procurement procedures takes a minimum of three to four months. The obligation of design teams to comply with building regulations, health and safety regulations and other statutory requirements demands careful attention to detail, thus taking time. The procurement of full planning permission and a fire officer's certificate takes a minimum of three to five months. The need to achieve a good competitive tender result requires vigilance in the preparation of tender documents. Finally, current capacity issues within the construction industry are an impediment to expeditious delivery of capital projects.</P>

      <P>At primary level, my Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of school secretaries and caretakers under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. However, this scheme has been superseded in the PESP Agreement of 1992 by a more extensive grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The PESP scheme provides <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services which are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita </i>grants. Under this scheme qualifying schools receive grants of £40 per pupil &ndash; £20 per pupil in respect of each service &ndash; subject to a maximum of £20,000 &ndash; maximum of £10,000 in respect of each service.</P>
      <P>I increased the rates of grant by 33% from £30 per pupil to £40 per pupil with effect from January 2000. Furthermore, with effect from September 2000, I extended the scheme to all primary schools. In addition, I have set a minimum grant of £2,400 per annum which is payable to all schools with 60 pupils or less. These improvements mean that for the first time all primary schools now qualify for an annual grant to assist them with the provision of secretarial and caretaking services. The Government's commitment in this regard can also be measured by the fact that the funding allocated for this purpose, which was approximately £5.6 million in 1999, increased in 2000 to approximately £12.2 million and has further increased in 2001 to approximately £16.8 million.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, officials from my Department are in discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the phasing out of community employment schemes in schools. These discussions are aimed at ensuring that as CE schemes in schools are phased out funding equivalent to the amount spent on such schemes is made available to my Department.</P>
      <P>One of the effects of a transfer of funding from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to my Department would be to remove the anomalies that exist at the moment in relation to the provision of secretarial and caretaking services to schools. For instance, certain schools currently have the benefit of secretarial and caretaking services under CE schemes and also receive a grant for such services from my Department, whereas other schools are solely dependent on the grants that are issued by my Department. The purpose of the discussions taking place is to transfer full responsibility for the funding of schools for secretarial and caretaking services to my Department. This would result in a uniform and equitable system of funding for such services.</P>

      <P>The State's appeal to the Supreme Court in the case of Jamie Sinnott and the Minister for Education and Science, Ireland, and the Attorney General is pending and is expected to open at the end of next month. This appeal is being conducted in order to clarify points of law arising from the judgment of Mr. Justice Barr in the case and the appropriate documents of appeal have been lodged in the Supreme Court office. In view of the fact that the Supreme Court now has jurisdiction over this matter it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment on the issues arising in the case.</P>
      <P>I would however like to inform the Deputy that the outcome of this appeal will not affect the damages which have been paid to Jamie Sinnott and his mother. These amount to £42,000 to enable Mrs. Sinnott to put in place a home based applied behaviour analysis programme for her son. An additional £15,000 has also been paid to Mrs. Sinnott to cover expenses already incurred by her in providing an education for Jamie.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be interested to know that the Government has decided to pay all the costs arising from the High Court case and the Supreme Court appeal, whatever the outcome. This is a most unusual step in a case such as this but it has been taken to ensure that the Sinnotts are not exposed financially in circumstances where the need to have legal certainty on important issues requires an appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>Funding of schools at both primary and second level is structured on the basis of capitation grants with additional grants towards services such as caretaking and secretarial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has placed a high priority on increasing funding for schools. Recent developments include at primary level significant improvement in the level of capitation grants. The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools has been increased from £45 per pupil to £75.50 in the current school year, and a rate of £80 will apply in the 2000-01 school year. At second level, the <i>per capita </i>grant was increased <Col N="610" /> by £8 from September last and will be further increased by £10 to £202 for the next school year. In addition, schools with disadvantaged status receive further capitation of £30 per pupil per year, bringing the overall <i>per capita </i>payment in respect of such pupils to £232. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This Government has demonstrated a clear commitment to improving the resourcing of schools at all levels and I intend to build on this in the future.</P>

      <P>Following the publication of the Report on the Whole School Evaluation (WSE) Pilot Project, a draft circular and criteria of evaluation for WSE were circulated to the education partners for their views, as part of the consultative process. At present, evaluation criteria are being finalised. The criteria of evaluation will delineate the aspects of quality assurance to be encompassed by WSE and cover five key areas of school activity: (1) learning and teaching, (2) school planning, (3) school management, (4) curriculum provision and (5) support for students and the characteristic spirit of the school.</P>
      <P>Preparation for the system wide implementation of WSE is a central element of business planning within the inspectorate. All inspectors have been engaged in appropriate training programmes and some restructuring is in process within the Inspectorate in order to focus on its core evaluative function as set out in section 13 of the Education Act, 1998. In addition, the inspectorate has published its Professional Code of Practice on Evaluation and Reporting which sets out the general principles and guidelines that inform the work of inspectors as they engage in the process of evaluation and reporting. This code of practice will also be of assistance to schools and inspectors as they prepare for the implementation of WSE.</P>
      <P>Given the current industrial relations environment, and the need to continue with the partnership approach already adopted in the WSE process, it is not yet possible to indicate precisely when WSE will be introduced throughout first and second level education.</P>

      <P>FÁS has recently assumed responsibility for the provision of advice, guidance and training services in relation to vocational-employment skills training at a variety of levels for people with disabilities, and provides a range of grants and schemes aimed at employers, employees and participants for this purpose. In relation to education, a recent survey carried out by AHEAD has shown that 850 students with physical, sensory or learning disabilities participated in third level education in 1998-99. My Department administers a special fund under which grants are provided towards the cost of adaptive technology, readers, transport, interpreters, care assistants etc. to support students with disabilities to participate in PLC and third level courses. I increased significantly the allocation for the fund from £700,000 in 1999 to £1,233,000 in 2000. Last September I established an action group on access to third level education to advise me on the development of a co-ordinated national framework to promote the participation at third level of students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students, building on the experience of current initiatives.</P>
      <P>The main remit of the group was to advise on the barriers to participation by disadvantaged students in higher education, with particular regard to the commitment by this Government to provide £95 million under the national development plan to tackle under-representation. I have just received the report of the action group and I am at present considering its recommendations. In addition, 410 students with disabilities are participating on the vocational training opportunities scheme. VTOS provides second chance education and training of one and two years duration for adults over 21 who are at least six months unemployed. An allowance is paid in lieu of social welfare benefits. The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs also provides opportunities for this group to return to second, further or third level education and retain an allowance in lieu of social welfare entitlements.</P>

      <P>School principals can play an important role in the induction, probation, training and professional development of teachers. The role of principals in providing leadership and guidance to <Col N="613" /> teachers and in developing a school environment which is conducive to their professional development is acknowledged in the Education Act, 1998. In addition, my Department's In-career development unit has been engaged in widespread consultation with groups representing school principals at first and second level and with management bodies at both levels regarding the provision of professional development for principals.</P>
      <P>The Teaching Council Bill, which is currently before the House, represents the culmination of a process of consultation and deliberation which began some two and a half years ago. It began with the establishment of a steering committee, in which teachers were centrally involved, which advised on all aspects of the establishment of a teaching council, including the composition of the council. The steering committee's report was published in October 1998 and the drafting of the legislation was based on the conclusions and recommendations of the report, which was agreed by all involved.</P>
      <P>Any unilateral change to the recommended composition of the teaching council along the lines suggested by the Deputy would disturb the fine balance agreed by the steering committee in a way which would be difficult to restore. As far as principals in particular are concerned, they will have an opportunity to play a full and active role in the work of the council. As teachers, they will be entitled to seek election to the council and, as union members, they will be entitled to pursue nomination to the council through their respective unions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully supportive of the RAPID programme targeted at the 25 most concentrated areas of disadvantage in the country, launched recently by the Taoiseach, as there is undoubtedly a strong link between poor educational achievement and socio-economic deprivation. While my Department, as currently structured, is not in a <Col N="614" /> position to provide representation on each of the 25 RAPID area implementation teams, I have requested that the task force which is drawing up a blueprint for the implementation of the Cromien report &ndash; the review of Department's operations, systems and staffing needs &ndash; should develop proposals in this regard.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, up to £5.35 billion will be provided for education which includes social inclusion and lifelong learning measures and education infrastructure. It is envisaged that the RAPID programme will prioritise the 25 identified areas and front-load expenditure to tackle the varying needs and priorities of each area. My Department has an extensive range of programmes including staffing support to assist schools serving the areas of greatest disadvantage. These include: &ldquo;Giving Children An Even Break&rdquo;&ndash; the new programme for pupils in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds. This provision now incorporates schools that already have designated disadvantaged status and schools in the urban dimension of Breaking the Cycle. Schools in the latter project are being allocated additional funding under the new programme.</P>
    <P>Schools categorised as urban-town with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils will be supported where necessary through the three-year period by staff allocations to implement a PTR of 20:1 in the junior classes &ndash; infants through second class &ndash;  and a maximum of 29:1 in senior classes, third through sixth classes.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Stay in School&rdquo; Retention at Second Level in 117 schools incorporates learning about the importance of integrated services from the 8-15 early school leaver initiative. Participating schools are required to devise focused and targeted integrated plans that involve local agencies in collaborative actions in support of young people at risk of early school leaving. A team of three co-ordinators is supporting schools in preparation of their plans towards which additional financial and other supports are provided. The home/school/community liaison scheme promotes parental collaboration with teachers in the children's learning.</P>
    <P>Learning support and resource teachers are also included.</P>

      <P>In January last, my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, the Minister of State with responsibility for school transport, announced a number of major improvements to the school transport scheme. These are the first major improvements to the scheme since its inception in 1967 and they include reducing the qualifying distance for pri<Col N="615" /> mary school pupils aged ten or over from three miles to two miles, so that all primary pupils will be treated equally for eligibility purposes; the number of eligible primary pupils required to establish a new school bus service has been reduced from 10 to 7. There will be a reduction in the threshold for maintaining a service to four eligible pupils provided there is also a minimum of six fare paying pupils using the service. The combined maximum daily travelling and waiting times for post-primary pupils will be reduced from three hours to 2.5 hours. The distance requirement for primary pupils to qualify for remote area and scheme D grants will be reduced from three miles to two miles and the grants will be paid to each family. The qualifying distance for grant aid for post primary pupils residing remote from a school bus route will be reduced from three to two miles. The rate of grant payable is being increased and the question of two or more families sharing a grant will no longer arise. All school vehicles will have a communications system on board in place during the course of this school year. Arrangements will be made for all buses to have first-aid kits on board by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>It has also been decided to make provision for parents to pay for extensions of bus services where feasible having regard to time schedules and avoidance of major disruption to other pupils using the service.</P>

      <P>I have recently announced that 50 additional posts for guidance and counselling will <Col N="616" /> be allocated to schools to develop innovative ways of enhancing guidance for students and to promote links between schools, business, voluntary and State agencies. I hope to be in a position to make a further announcement in relation to guidance in schools in the near future.</P>
      <P>In relation to the current availability of guidance services, I have recently received the results of an audit of all second-level schools, conducted on behalf of my Department by the National Centre for Guidance in Education. It is clear from the audit that a significant number of schools are not fully utilising the resources currently being made available to them by my Department for guidance and that, in many schools, the service is not adequately targeted at pupils at risk.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, my first priority is to ensure that the resources made available to schools for guidance are fully utilised for that purpose. In line with the Government's priority to promote social inclusion, my other concern is to ensure that those young people who are most at risk of dropping out of education early are a major focus of guidance provision in schools. As a result, any future enhancement of provision to individual schools will be conditional on their making a commitment to providing a service to all their pupils in ways which would reflect both Government priorities and pupils' needs.</P>

      <P>This Department and its offices, other than those referred to below, spent £135,000 in the year 2000 out of the departmental advertising subhead. This spend was on advertising in media other than television. An additional amount of £122,350 was spent on a once off advertising campaign to publicise the introduction of the national minimum wage. Television advertising for the national minimum wage cost £58,727, of which £2,211 was spent on broadcasts on the Irish Language station, TG4.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Companies Registration Office, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Labour Court/Labour Relations Commission and the Competition Authority spent £231,508 on advertising in 2000.

      <P>The standards based apprenticeship system, which does not carry an age limitation, was introduced over the period 1993-97. This system of apprenticeship is the principal means by which craft training is provided in this State and is based on the achievement of set standards for each craft or trade. Entry to apprenticeship is open to all candidates who meet the entry requirements and who are <Col N="620" /> put forward for registration by their employer, whether from the public or the private sector.</P>
      <P>The minimum entry requirements to the standards based system are that a prospective apprentice must be at least 16 years old and must have at least a grade D in any five subjects in the junior certificate or equivalent grades in other approved examinations. Alternatively, where a candidate for apprenticeship does not meet the minimum educational requirements referred to, they can pursue a pre-apprenticeship course approved by FÁS following an assessment interview, on successful completion of which they can qualify for an apprenticeship. If the applicant is over 25 years of age and has a minimum of three years work experience relevant to the chosen craft, he or she may also qualify to do an apprenticeship subject to an assessment interview.</P>
      <P>In so far as the question of providing accelerated apprenticeships arises in the context of the tight labour market and the potential to provide progression routes, my Department is open to discussing this issue with the social partners.</P>

      <P>The maximum grant aid rates payable by the industrial development agencies in respect of new industrial investment are becoming increasingly differentiated on a regional basis under the regional aid rates approved by the EU Commission for the period 2000 to 2006. Under this regime, the maximum aid rate for firms in the Border, midland and west regions is 40% for large firms with an additional 15% for SMEs. The maximum aid rate in Dublin is 17.5% for large firms with an additional 10% for SMEs.</P>
      <P>The rest of the country is currently in transition, from rates which were close to the BMW rates in 2000 to rates of 18% to 20% for large firms with an additional 10% for SMEs by 2004. In relation to training and research and development grants, there are different grant rates for different types of training or research and development, but the maximum rates of aid payable for the training of workers or as support for research and development projects can be increased by 10% in the BMW area and by 5% in all other areas of Ireland, as compared to what is payable in areas of the EU which are not entitled to pay any regional aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new regime, coupled with the 12.5% cor<Col N="621" /> poration tax rate and initiatives on matters such as education, physical infrastructure and technology under the national plan, allows Ireland to remain competitive both in developing indigenous industry and securing inward investment projects. The regional differentiation reflects the relative positions of the regions in terms of economic development. In conjunction with it, a strong focus on regional development is being implemented by the industrial development agencies.</P>

      <P>There are four seaports which cater for multipurpose ferries, namely, Cork, Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and Rosslare. Each is managed and operated by a separate commercial State company under the Harbours Acts, 1996-2000, apart from Rossslare which is operated by Irish Rail. I am advised that the following measures are being adopted by the port companies concerned.</P>
      <P>In the case of the facilities at Dublin Port, I have been advised that a spray bar was installed in ramp No. 1 in 1967 as at that time the spread of foot and mouth was also a concern. However, through age and non-use, the facility deteriorated and was removed as it was not deemed to be serviceable. The ramps installed in recent years do not have a spray bar facility as this was no longer deemed necessary. In addition to notification measures, the following disinfection measures are currently in place: disinfection mats have been placed in the terminal buildings for all passengers; disinfection mats are in place in all ro/ro terminals for vehicles discharging from vessels; six portable spray units are in operation; disinfection mats have been placed at the grain/agrifeed sector; disinfection mats have been placed at the main entrances and exits to the port.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above measures the following are being put in place: installation of seven disinfectant spray systems is under way and due to be operational by today, Wednesday, 7 March 2001 and installation of six disinfectant troughs commenced on 5 March 2001.</P>
      <P>In respect of the facilities at Dún Laoghaire Harbour, an automatic spraying mechanism previously existed on the Carlisle Pier. This pier, however, is no longer used for ferry traffic. With regard to the present foot and mouth crisis, measures have been implemented by the management of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company to combat the threat of the disease in full co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development officials.</P>
      <P>These measures include disinfectant mats placed in the terminal building, all vehicle passengers being channelled across these mats, six water pumps with associated disinfectant tanks and mats have been set up at arrival gates and disinfectant mats have been placed at the entry and exits points to the HSS passenger baggage vehicle compound and at all staff entrances disinfectant mats have been set up at both pedestrian and vehicle exits.</P>
      <P>The Port of Cork Company has confirmed that spray gullies were never removed from the port facilities. All vehicles discharged from ro/ro vessels are sprayed with disinfectant. Matting soaked with disinfectant has been placed at the exit ramps at Ringaskiddy ro/ro berth and at the entrance to the Ringaskiddy bulk terminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rosslare Europort, which is managed and operated by Iarnród Éireann, has confirmed that no automotive disinfectant spray gullies were ever removed from the port. Vehicles are rou<Col N="623" /> tinely sprayed as they disembark from each vessel by means of a spray bar situated at the shore end of each linkspan. Foot passengers must walk over disinfectant mats as they disembark from the gangway and car passengers and lorry drivers must walk over disinfectant mats before they enter the car decks to gain access to their vehicles.</P>
    <P>The management at each port is alert to the necessary requirements and is working in close co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and will, in association with officials in my Department, keep procedures under constant review to ensure all necessary protocols are being complied with.</P>

      <P>Pending completion of the detailed design of the Nore River, Kilkenny city, drainage scheme, it was not possible to definitively indicate the extent of the proposed works in individual areas of Kilkenny city and accordingly it was not considered premature to meet with the residents of Dukes Meadows and Riverside Drive. Now that the detailed design has been finalised and tenders have been invited for the works, returnable in mid April 2001, with a view to getting on site this summer, arrangements will be made to meet with those residents groups.</P>
      <P>The removal of trees and scrub along the river banks in Kilkenny city, which is being undertaken after consultation with officials of Kilkenny County Council and Corporation, is an integral part of the scheme works programme and was clearly identified as such in the scheme documentation publicly exhibited in Kilkenny city in June 1999, for which affected owners, the general public and public representatives had opportunities to comment. Indeed, the removal of trees, which has to be undertaken at this time and completed by mid-March due to environmental considerations, was specifically discussed with the local authorities and public representatives at a joint meeting of Kilkenny County Council and Corporation on 23 June 1999 at which officials from the Office of Public Works were in attendance.</P>
      <P>A press briefing was planned for Monday, 5 March but was cancelled because of the current foot and mouth and disease restrictions. The Office of Public Works officials and its consulting engineers will be available when travel restrictions associated with this crises are eased to meet with local authority officials, public representatives or other concerned groups. It is intended that concerns about the scheme can be allayed and the general public made aware of progress of the scheme by means of a newsletter(s) to be circulated in the area.</P>

      <P>At present, there is an annual stamp duty charge of £5 per automatic teller machine &ndash; ATM &ndash; card. There are exemptions from this charge where: a card has not been used during the accounting period and on any card issued in respect of a deposit account where the average daily balance did not exceed £10.</P>
      <P>This charge to stamp duty is levied on financial institutions which offer these cash card accounts. However, section 123(9) of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act, 1999, entitles the promoters of these cash cards to charge the account holders the amount of stamp duty and the financial institutions usually do pass on this stamp duty charge to their customers.</P>
      <P>In 2000, the yield from this source was £9.1 million. I have no plans to introduce any exemptions in relation to this small £5 charge as proposed by the Deputy.</P>

Because of the generous Exchequer incentive being offered &ndash; a contribution of £1 for every £4 saved by an individual &ndash; it was considered that, as a <i>quid pro quo</i>, a period of at least five years' savings by an individual was the minimum acceptable. I would therefore not be in favour of reducing this five year period for any category of saver.</P>

    <P>The taxpayer's VAT returns are now up to date. If he wishes to renew his application for a C2 certificate, and he is still trading from his parents' home, he must provide evidence that he has security of tenure in respect of the premises. A lease, of at least 12 months duration, on the <Col N="635" /> premises or part of the premises, would fulfil this requirement.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the current difficulties in the recruitment and retention of child care workers in the health service. This title encompasses the grades of house parent, assistant house parent and trainee house parent.</P>
      <P>The expert group's report on various health professions, published in April 2000, recommended that child care workers be accorded formal professional status and that the recruitment of non-qualified staff must eventually cease. It also recommended the establishment of a joint committee to deal with issues arising from the recognition of the autonomy of the profession, including: the setting up of a proper career structure for both residential and community care workers; the changes required in general management of a child and family services, and in the case of management arising as a consequence; the management of changes arising from the ending of recruitment of non-qualified child care workers; a complete review of the training available to child care workers, with a view to the introduction of a nationally recognised professional qualification and the provision of regular in-service training; and the arrangements for training of unqualified staff to an accepted standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This joint committee has been established and its work is ongoing. The work being undertaken <Col N="636" /> by this committee will address many of the recruitment and retention issues facing the profession at the moment. The committee is currently engaged in a complete review of the training available to child care workers and as part of this task, it is examining the issue of workforce planning for the profession. It is also examining how the issue of training non-qualified staff can be addressed. The matter of pay and career structure is being reviewed by this committee.</P>
    <P>The current basic qualification for trainee and assistant house parent is the leaving certificate. This is being reviewed by the committee. However, assistant house parents must acquire a recognised qualification in child care/social care in order to progress to the top of the salary scale. Similarly, house parents are required to possess a recognised qualification for entry to that grade. The recognised qualifications are as follows: National Diploma in Child Care; National Diploma in Applied Social Studies in Social Care (NCEA); Diploma in Child Care/Social Care; Diploma in Applied Social Studies &ndash; Social Care (Dublin Institute of Technology); or equivalent qualification.</P>
    <P>The total number of students enrolled in third level child care courses in 1997 was 811. This total had increased to 908 by the year 2000, an increase of 12%.</P>

      <P>There have been substantial developments in the care and treatment of patients with cancer throughout the country over the last number of years since the launch in November 1996 of the National Cancer Strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sub group of the National Cancer Forum undertook a detailed review of the symptomatic breast cancer services with the over-riding objective of developing our breast cancer treatment services to an optimal level that ensures the highest possible quality of care and the best opportunity for long-term survival for breast cancer patients. Their recommendations are contained in a report entitled &ldquo;Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease&rdquo;. I accept the broad thrust of this report. In relation to the specific recommendations concerning services in the North Western Health Board area, the report recommends that there should be one specialist breast unit in the area. There is an acknowledge<Col N="637" /> ment in the report that there is a service currently being provided in both Sligo and Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>The North Western Health Board is actively engaged in discussions with very many interested parties in endeavouring to put proposals together on the development of specialist breast disease services. The board has cognisance of the fact that whatever services are put in place must be of the highest standards possible and that outcomes for patients would be favourably comparable with international standards.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these deliberations and consultations on the future provision of services for symptomatic breast disease will result in an enhancement of the services currently being provided for women in the North Western Health Board area.</P>

      <P>Charges for hospital care can be made under the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 1976, as amended by the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 1987. These regulations enable charges to be made towards the cost of providing hospital in-patient services for persons with income who have been in receipt of such services for more than 30 days or for periods totalling more than 30 days within the previous 12 months.</P>
      <P>Medical card holders are exempt from these charges, and are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services. In practice, however, persons in health board long-stay care do not usually hold medical cards as the hospital takes responsibility for all of the person's health needs. Persons with dependants are also exempt.</P>
      <P>In deciding the amount to be contributed health boards have regard to the person's individual circumstances. Allowance is made for any financial commitments the person may have and a reasonable amount is left to meet the person's personal needs. Charges may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship. The application of the charges concerned rests with the chief executive officer of the South Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 to 139, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The information concerning adverse reactions to drugs, to which the Deputy refers, was taken from the Irish Medicines Board drug safety newsletter, circulated in December 2000. This edition included an article on the Meningococcal C vaccine, which referred to 143 reports of suspected adverse drug reactions, which had occurred in the same number of children. The majority of these reports were classified as &ldquo;non-serious&rdquo; and consisted mainly of local reactions, rashes and fever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining reports were classified as serious, in accordance with the internationally agreed definition of the term. The majority of the &ldquo;serious&rdquo; reports include cases of rashes, fever, syncope, urticaria and hypotensive episodes and were classified as &ldquo;serious&rdquo; only because the patients concerned required treatment such as antibiotics, antihistamines or observation in hospital. Two of the reports were cases of menin<Col N="639" /> gococcal B infection, which of course could not be related to the vaccine.</P>
    <P>The incidence of adverse reactions is not unexpected and the majority of reactions notified to date are currently reflected in the product information. The reports of reactions in 143 children should be evaluated in light of the estimated use of the product. Approximately 350,000 doses of the vaccine were administered in Ireland during that time period &ndash; October to December 2000. It is also important to note that, prior to the launch of the vaccination campaign, the Office for Health Gain actively encouraged the reporting of any suspected adverse reactions to drugs observed with this new vaccine.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board is unaware of any specific incidence where it was unable to provide up to date statistics on adverse reactions. The board has informed me that on receipt of a suspected adverse drug reaction report, the pharmacovigilance and medical staff immediately review, validate and evaluate the report concerned. Frequently, this requires follow-up correspondence with the reporting healthcare professional or pharmaceutical company. The Irish Medicines Board is willing to give updated information at any time but this information can only be released when follow-up and evaluation of the case report has been completed.</P>

      <P>Those who believe they may be at risk have been advised to attend their local STI Clinic. Contact tracing is being carried out through the STI clinics.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>A substantial proportion of care staff working in the residential child care area do not have recognised qualifications for residential child care. This is an issue which I am working to address. However, it should be noted that staff have a wide variety of other educational and vocational qualifications which are undoubtedly useful to them in their work with children. The qualifications include degrees in subjects such as social science, psychology and social psychology, as well as diplomas and certificates in counselling, child protection and welfare, youth and community work, sports leadership, applied social studies and a range of nursing qualifications, including general, psychiatric and mental handicap nursing.</P>
      <P>The Expert Working Group on Various Health Professionals, established under the terms of Labour Court Recommendation 15515 recommended &lsquo;that child care workers be accorded professional status and as a consequence recruitment of non-qualified personnel must eventually cease'. In pursuance of this, a joint committee, comprising representatives from my Department, the Health Service Employers Agency, the health services and IMPACT, has been established to deal with issues arising from the recognition of the autonomy of the child care profession, including a complete review of the training available to child care workers, with a view to the introduction of a nationally recognised professional qualification and provision of in-service training. Discussions are also taking place with colleges to develop courses which are more appropriate for work in residential care.</P>
      <P>The current economic climate makes the recruitment of staff difficult and health boards need to be conscious of this. Indeed, some health boards have recruited staff from outside the State.</P>
      <P>In relation to Newtown House, the centre is now closed and I have asked the chief executive officer of the East Coast Area Health Board, the body which has statutory responsibility, to take urgent action to address the findings of the report produced by the social services inspectorate. Resources have already been made available to the health board for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I have also asked the health boards to ensure that proper support structures are put in place to support staff working in residential child care.</P>

      <P>The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There <Col N="643" /> are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable, £70, £95, £120 in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high, maximum which are eligible for subvention. However, it is the intention to increase the rates by 25% to £90, £120 and £150, from 1 April next.</P>
      <P>A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Sections 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. The application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned, in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within available resources.</P>

      <P>Overall, the three area health boards of the Eastern Regional Health Authority report that information from users and outreach staff indicates that crack cocaine does not appear to be a significant problem in the Dublin region at present. However, one area health board reports that its drugs service has noticed an increase in cocaine use over the last six months, particularly in the inner city area.</P>
      <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that a special operation is in place to investigate the appearance of crack cocaine and a particular group is being targeted in this regard. He has also informed me that he has been assured by An Garda Síochána that there is no evidence to suggest a growing presence, or the widespread availability, of crack cocaine in Dublin or elsewhere in the country and that they continuously monitor and analyse the trends and patterns in illicit drug use based upon seizure data. They are well aware, from foreign experience, of the addictive and behaviour changing nature of crack cocaine and in this context, the incidence of cocaine base usage will be kept under review, with the utmost urgency being attached to investigations in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treatment of those addicted to cocaine is primarily through counselling. Additional counsellors and outreach workers have been recruited by the three area health boards in recent years. Addiction counsellors are given training in relation to specific areas of cocaine abuse which are problematic. General practitioners who treat <Col N="644" /> drug users who are also abusing cocaine, have sufficient knowledge of the effects and implications of cocaine use.</P>
    <P>Individuals presenting for treatment for cocaine abuse can attend any of the addiction centres, where they will receive an emergency assessment from which the most appropriate response can be determined. This response invariably involves linking in with a counsellor, to examine the issues around cocaine use and may also involve the provision of support to family members.</P>
    <P>The Northern Area Health Board, which has responsibility for the north inner city area, is providing extra counselling to clients who have cocaine problems. The board is also increasing outreach services in this area. In addition, it is reviewing its initiatives and will increase treatment provision if necessary.</P>
    <P>The health boards also monitor the emergence of new substances, through informal contact with drug users, formal links between outreach workers and users groups and by examining statistical data which is collected on an ongoing basis by the national drug treatment reporting system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>The role of the health boards in relation to private nursing homes, as provided for in the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, is twofold &ndash; first, to ensure high standards of accommodation in the homes and, second, to operate a subvention scheme towards the cost of nursing home care. Under the Nursing Homes Act, health boards are empowered to pay a subvention where a person has been assessed on the grounds of means and dependency. It is important to point out that, subject to a means test, a person will only be entitled to a subvention if they fulfil the dependency criteria laid down in the Subvention Regulations, 1993. The question of admission to a private nursing home is a matter between the patient and the owner of the nursing home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health board homes provide a range of ancillary services, such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy, etc., with a wider <Col N="645" /> range of staff employed. Articles 30(b) and 31 of the Nursing Home (Care and Welfare) Regulations state that the registered proprietor and the person in charge of the nursing home, shall ensure that when a person requires physiotherapy, occupational therapy or other health service, such service is made available by the registered proprietor or by arrangement with the health board. These services may be provided by a health board to a nursing home at the request of the registered proprietor or person in charge, upon such terms, charges and conditions and to such extent as the health board may determine, following discussion with the registered proprietor of the home. It is also open to a patient to make private arrangements for the provision of these services, if they so wish.</P>
    <P>I would like to advise the Deputy that the amount of funding allocated to supporting people in private nursing homes has been significantly increased by this Government in recent years, from £23.8 million in 1998 to £33.1 million in 1999 and to £38.5 million in 2000. A further £14 million has been provided in 2001, bringing the total funding available to £52.5 million. It is the intention to increase the rate of subvention in respect of private nursing homes by 25% with effect from 1 April 2001.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of medical services to eligible persons is, in this instance, the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board. I understand from the board that there was an average of six to seven patients each day in the accident and emergency department of the County Hospital, Roscommon, awaiting in-patient accommodation over the past three months. These patients were accommodated on beds in the annex adjacent to the accident and emergency department. During this period there were peaks in activity when 15 to 16 patients were in the accident and emergency department awaiting in-patient accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the board that the number of attendances at the accident and emergency department during January 2001 exceeded that of <Col N="646" /> January 2000 by 500. The number of admissions during January was 9% greater than in January 2000. The board has advised that a number of steps were taken to alleviate the problem: winter initiative contract beds were used extensively; general practitioners were contacted and made aware of the situation in the A&amp;E department; and other hospitals within reasonable distance were contacted.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in December 1999 formal approval was given to an outline development control plan for the hospital and that a design team has been appointed for developments at the hospital which includes a new accident and emergency department, an admissions unit, a medical records department, radiology film storage, staff changing facilities and an ultrasound room at an estimated capital cost of over £4 million. The design team has developed an outline development plan. Approval to HPO stage two planning was given on 7 December 2000. The design team is now progressing with stage three which is the detailed planning of the project. It is expected that the construction work will commence on site in the autumn of 2001 with an estimated completion date of early 2003.</P>

      <P>The report of the Ombudsman into the nursing home subvention scheme identified a number of issues relating to the operation of the scheme and the findings of <Col N="647" /> the report are being fully considered in my Department. It is the intention of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, to bring proposals to Government in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the Ombudsman's report, the forthcoming expenditure review of the subvention scheme, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993.</P>
      <P>Our immediate priority is to ensure that the two aspects of the regulations that have the most direct impact on nursing home patients and their families are fully addressed without delay. Arrangements have already been made to enable nursing home patients and their families who may be due payments arising from the provisions in the regulations relating to the retention of one fifth of the rate of non-contributory old age pension for personal use to be refunded speedily.</P>
      <P>It has also been decided that payments should be made to those who were adversely affected by the provision in the regulations which allowed for the assessment of circumstances of adult sons and daughters and which was removed with effect from 1 January 1999. A group representing my Department and the health boards/Eastern Regional Health Authority has been established and is putting in place procedures to ensure that moneys will be paid in a uniform manner as quickly as possible to those whose subvention was unfavourably affected by this regulation. It is expected that these payments will cost in the region of £6 million. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, this will be a complex exercise involving,<i> inter alia</i>, difficult issues of traceability, and it may take some time to complete. Nevertheless, I can offer assurance that every effort will be made to make payments as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>In the particular case referred to by the Deputy, I have asked the regional chief executive of the ERHA to investigate the matter and reply directly.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office, which operates under the aegis of my Department, co-ordinates and monitors the implementation of the Dublin transportation initiative strategy. I am satisfied that satisfactory progress is being made with the implementation of the DTI strategy and that significant and important measures are under way to tackle traffic congestion in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The DTO policy document, A Platform for Change, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 2 October 2000, sets out a comprehensive integrated strategy to respond to the transportation needs of the greater Dublin area, GDA, in the period to 2016. This strategy document updates and builds substantially on progress achieved under the Dublin transportation initiative final report already approved by the Government in 1995, taking account of the strategic planning guidelines published in 1999. Further work is being completed on the detail of the strategy, including an examination of the various demand management options available with a view to ensuring that the greatly enhanced public transport facilities, which will be provided, will be utilised to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>The total estimated capital cost of the strategy is £14.2 billion and implementation is expected to result in a high quality public transport service being available to most people within ten minutes walking distance of where they live, increase the share of the market accounted for by public transport from 35% to 65%, reduce congestion, improve accessibility and result in significant environmental gains including reductions in energy use and emissions below what they would be otherwise. During the period 1994 to 2000, the Dublin Transportation Office paid out grants amounting to £71.5 million on traffic management schemes in the greater Dublin area. Under the national development plan, over £3 billion is provided to continue DTI related funding through the period 2000 to 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DTO is currently preparing a new short-term action plan, designed to advance and accelerate a set of measures, consistent with the DTI strategy, which can be completed in the period to end 2003. This plan will be completed in the near future. Good progress was made with the implementation of the last short-term action plan which covered the period 1998 to 2000. For example, all 150 of the planned new buses have been delivered; work is proceeding on the plan<Col N="649" /> ning, design and implementation of the quality bus corridor, QBC, network with five QBCs now in operation and four to be introduced before the end of April 2001; the programme of platform lengthening is well under way; delivery of the additional DART rolling stock and railcars has commenced and the upgrading of the Maynooth-Clonsilla rail line has been completed. The measures being implemented and those planned to reduce traffic congestion will have positive effects for the speed of business deliveries.</P>

      <P>The essential repairs grants scheme is targeted at meeting the needs of elderly people living in unfit housing who would otherwise need to be rehoused by the local authority. The scheme enables basic repairs to be carried out to houses which cannot be made fit in all respects at a reasonable cost so that they can continue to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for the occupants. I have substantially improved the terms and conditions of the grant, increasing the effective maximum grant from £1,800 to £7,500 and extending the availability of the grant to urban areas.</P>
      <P>The framework laid down in the statutory regulations is, as far as practicable, designed to give a degree of flexibility to local authorities, and for this reason does not specify in detail what works qualify for grant assistance. It is a matter for the local authority to assess the circumstances of each individual case and decide what works are necessary to prolong the useful life of the house for the occupants. The increase in the maximum grant has allowed local authorities greater flexibility in relation to the type of works which may be carried out under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Enabling responsibility for decisions to rest, as far as possible, with the local authority in relation to individual grant applications has long been a feature of housing policy and is in line with general Government policies on devolution. Indeed, all of the most recent social housing schemes have been devolved to local authorities from day one. In relation to the essential repairs grant scheme, it is a matter in the first instance, for the local authority to develop their own policy approach within the statutory framework and to exercise appropriate discretion in individual cases within this framework.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that where payment of an essential repairs grant would not be appropriate, consideration might be given to the possibility of utilising the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the improvement works in lieu of local authority housing scheme or the task force on special housing aid for the elderly to provide assistance.</P>

      <Quest>his views on the refusal by An Bord Pleanála of 19% of permissions for child care facilities against local authorities and their own inspectors' views as opposed to only 9% in other types of application; his policy in this area; the way in which an individual can take a judicial review if the minutes of An Bord Pleanála are not available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bord Pleanála is a statutory independent body established under section 3 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976. It would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment on decisions taken by the board. However, while I am aware from the board's annual reports that they overturn the recommendation of their inspector in 9% to 10% of cases, I am not aware of the source of the statement in the question that the board has refused 19% of permissions for child care facilities against local authority and their own inspector's view. The board appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment and Local Government on 22 November 2000, specifically in relation to decisions on child care facilities, and Deputies had an opportunity to raise the issues directly with the board.</P>
      <P>Government policy on child care is to increase the number of child care places available and to improve the quality of child care services for the community. I published draft guidelines for planning authorities on child care facilities for public consultation in May 2000. Those guidelines are currently being finalised by my Department following a public consultation process. The final guidelines will be issued as ministerial guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. Section 28 requires that planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála shall have regard to any such ministerial guidelines in the performance of their planning functions.</P>
      <P>Under planning law, a judicial review of a decision on a planning appeal by An Bord Pleanála may only be allowed where an application for leave for judicial review is sought within two months of the decision and only where the High Court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision is invalid or ought to be quashed. In relation to individual planning appeal cases, the whole file, including the decision, the inspector's report on the case and any directions given by the board in relation to the matter, is available for inspection by the public from the third working day following the board's decision. Therefore, documentation is currently made available which would facilitate any application which might be made for a judicial review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 313 of 20 February 2001, the Planning and Development Act, 2000, will require An Bord Pleanála to give the main reasons and considerations on which its decision on an appeal is based. In addition, under section 111(7) of the 2000 Act, An Bord Pleanála is required to keep a written record of all its decisions, including the names of the board members present and the number vot<Col N="654" /> ing for and against a decision. Regulations are currently being prepared by my Department which will enable me to bring the development control provisions of the Act, including these provisions, into force. In all these circumstances, I do not believe there is a need to require the board to keep minutes of its meetings.</P>

      <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, was enacted on 28 August 2000. Because of the scale and complexity of the provisions of the Act, and the need to make regulations to give full effect to its provisions, it is necessary to commence the Act in stages. To date, I have made two commencement orders bringing a number of parts of the Act into force on 1 November 2000 and 1 January 2001. These include Part II on development plans, Part V on the supply of housing, Part IX on strategic development zones, Part XIV on the acquisition of land and Part XX, which amends the Roads Act, 1993. Regulations are currently being prepared by my Department which will enable me to bring the development control provisions of the Act into force. Some of these regulations require the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas and I propose to submit draft regulations for approval within the next month.</P>

      <Quest>the compensation which he will make available for people whose NCT tests are due but who have been told that they can only tax their cars for three months rather than 12, at an extra cost of £47, due to the current industrial disputes at NCT test centres; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The requirement to present a valid NCT certificate with each application for motor tax renewal in respect of cars liable for the test was suspended with effect from 29 January 2001. This suspension was introduced to take account of certain car owners' difficulties in obtaining NCT certificates, arising out of an industrial dispute at a number of NCT test centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the temporary arrangements involved, owners of cars that have become liable for their first test since 1 January 2001 may renew their motor tax for a period of up to 12 months without the need to present an NCT certificate. The cars <Col N="655" /> in question are those that were first registered in the years 1992 to 1996.</P>
    <P>All pre-1992 cars were required to have been issued with NCT certificates not later than 31 December 2000. In the case of such cars for which NCT certificates were obtained at the appropriate time, motor tax may be renewed for up to 12 months, on presentation of the NCT certificates. In other cases, renewal may be for three months only. In these cases the cars were non-compliant before the industrial dispute began, as the NCT certificates had not been obtained at the time that the cars first became liable for test. I do not envisage compensation as part of this arrangement.</P>

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for full-time work and genuinely seeking work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or assistance. The relevant legislation specifies the circumstances in which a person is, or is not, deemed to be available for full-time work and genuinely seeking employment.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive guidelines on the application of the availability and genuinely seeking work conditions for entitlement to unemployment payments are made available to deciding officers and to the general public, on request. These guidelines are designed to ensure that the conditions for receipt of unemployment payments are applied in a uniform and consistent manner.</P>
      <P>In applying the legislation in any case, deciding officers have regard to the availability of job vacancies in the locality and to the extent to which a claimant has sought to take advantage of the labour market opportunities which exist. Any person who fails to satisfy the deciding officer that he or she is available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work is not entitled to an unemployment payment. School wardens are expected to meet the same requirements as other claimants in that regard.</P>
      <P>The introduction of special arrangements exempting school wardens from the requirements to fulfil the statutory conditions of being available for full-time work and genuinely seeking work for entitlement to unemployment benefit or assistance would raise equity issues <i>vis-à-vis</i> other claimants to unemployment payments. I have no plans at the present time to make any changes to the relevant legislation.</P>

      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Since its commencement, a total of £22 million has been allocated to the scheme, which to the end of 2000 has assisted some 80,482 individuals.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I propose to have the scheme of community support for older people advertised in both the national and provincial press by the end of March, at which time any voluntary or community based organisation working with or providing support for vulnerable older people may submit applications for funding on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the scheme grant aid is available towards the purchase and-or installation cost of: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems, such as the pendant alarm system, which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.</P>
      <P>Funding is not available under the scheme for conventional intruder-burglar alarms of the type indicated in the Deputy's question. To qualify for assistance under the scheme, older people, aged 65 or over, must be living alone or be living in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older people who are dependent and vulnerable and be unable to install or purchase the equipment covered by the scheme themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the actual grant available may vary in the light of individual circumstances, grants in general will cover 50% of total costs and will <Col N="661" /> cover up to 90% of costs where the circumstances so warrant.</P>

      <P>I will respond shortly to the Secretary General of the United Nations on the text of the UN. Resolution No. 2000/14 concerning the basic principles on the use of restorative justice programmes in criminal matters. I support the development of a new appropriate international instrument on restorative justice as my response will make clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Children Bill, 1999, which is before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, contains some of the most comprehensive and innovative provisions on restorative justice anywhere in the world. Those provisions are provided through restorative conferencing measures involving juvenile liaison officers or probation and welfare officers and restorative cautioning measures. They represent a new way of dealing with youth offending that is not an easy option but helps the offender to face up to the <Col N="663" /> consequences of his or her offending. Mediation between offender and victim may be a feature of restorative conferencing with the offender usually being required to apologise and make reparation to the victim. However, much more can be involved, depending on circumstances, such as restriction on movement, school attendance, counselling and participation in community activities. The legislation is generally in line with the text of the Resolution.</P>
    <P>In addition, on a non-statutory basis, I financially support two community based restorative justice initiatives &ndash; a three year pilot project involving a partnership between the Tallaght mediation service and the probation and welfare service, and a similar co-operative venture between the Nenagh community reparation project and the probation and welfare service.</P>

      <P>The areas mentioned by the Deputy are serviced by four Probation and Welfare staff based in Tallaght and Clondalkin. The staffing level has remained unchanged over the past five years. However, extra resources are planned as candidates from two recent recruitment campaigns take up duty in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is being made by my Department to address the question of vacancies in the Probation and Welfare Service. The Civil Service Commission held a recruitment campaign in recent months to fill both existing vacancies and newly sanctioned posts in the Probation and Welfare Service. Offers of appointment are currently in the process of being made to successful candidates. My Department recently advertised for the recruitment of 25 additional full-time temporary <Col N="665" /> unestablished positions of Probation and Welfare Officer and interviews to fill these posts are expected to be held shortly.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, while the Road Traffic Acts, 1961-1995, provide for a broad range of offences, there is no specific provision for dealing with the term &lsquo;road rage'. As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is responsible for road traffic legislation. The Garda authorities have assured me that the high priority given to enforcement of the road traffic laws will continue, with a primary aim of reducing the high rate of accidents and of bringing home to motorists the need to exercise due care and consideration for other road users.</P>
      <P>In relation to the issue of violence, the Criminal Justice (Public Order ) Act, 1994 and the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997 contain provisions which may apply to the types of incidents envisaged by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. E. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government is committed to targeting investment under the national development plan on a priority basis to the 25 most disadvantaged areas <Col N="670" /> in the State. To ensure a fair and transparent process the selection of these 25 areas was made on strictly objective criteria, using the established Trutz-Haase index of deprivation. DEDs which were categorised by this index as constituting the most acutely deprived areas in the State, that is the 5% most deprived DEDs in the country, were identified for designation. These areas, where suitably clustered and in some cases extended to include adjoining areas of local authority housing, in which at least 75% of the stock was held on a tenant basis, were designated as the 25 RAPID programme areas.</P>
      <P>At present, arrangements are being made for the recruitment of local co-ordinators for each of these areas, who will be responsible for putting the RAPID programme into operation. An area plan will be drawn up to assess the need for investment, supports or services in each area and funds committed under the NDP will be channelled by the appropriate service providers to the areas on the basis of this plan. This Government has earmarked a total sum of £15 billion in the national development plan to tackle problems of social exclusion in urban, provincial and rural Ireland and I believe that through these many initiatives, including the RAPID programme, steady progress will be made.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the money allocated by his Department in each of the past two years to have remedial works carried out at primary and second level schools which had been identified as having high levels of radon gas; if he will identify the schools where these works have been carried out; and the schools where such remedial works remain to be carried out.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department commissioned the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to conduct a survey of radon levels in primary and second level schools in 1998 for which an amount of £290,380 had been paid as at 31 December, 1999. The survey is being carried out in three phases. The results of phase one were issued to the participating schools in January 2000. The RPII recommended that 33 of these schools should be given priority treatment. Work in 13 of these schools is now complete at a cost of £104,972 which was expended in 2000. Preliminary post-mitigation testing indicates that the mitigation systems installed are functioning successfully as radon levels in all of these schools are now below the 200bq M3 reference level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that the cost of installing mitigation systems in the remaining schools from phases one and two that have radon levels in excess of 400bq M3 will be in the region of £1 million and will be incurred in the current year. My Department received the results of a ventilation study carried out by the building research establishment (BRE) in a number of schools with radon levels between 200bq M3 and 400bq M3. The purpose of the study was to establish whether passive ventilation measures could be used to mitigate radon levels in schools in this range. The <Col N="695" /> results of the study indicate that passive ventilation methods may be effective in these schools. At present, my Department is examining methods of empowering these schools to take the necessary measures. This will result in a cost to my Department this year, but that cost has not yet been quantified.</P>
    <P>The results of phase three of the radon survey are expected at the end of this year. As this is the case any expenditure on mitigation for the schools involved in this phase will be incurred in 2002, by which time it is hoped that almost all, if not all of, the expenditure on providing mitigation from the schools involved in phases one and two will be complete.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my previous reply on 1 February 2001, in which I outlined the ICT grants which are available from my Department to primary and post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>Under the Schools IT 2000 programme, grants have issued to all eligible schools and there is no need to make application. Expenditure under the minor works scheme &ndash; grant of £3,000 &ndash; is at the discretion of school authorities within the terms of Circular No. 4/2000. In the case of new second level schools or schools undergoing major works, the grant aid of computer equipment is catered for within the overall building application process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Department's initiative to increase the uptake of the physical sciences the post pri<Col N="697" /> mary building unit issues capital grants of £10,500 to all qualifying schools offering the physical sciences at senior cycle level. These grants are to facilitate school authorities with the acquisition of IT and data-logging equipment for their science laboratories. Inquiries in this regard may be made to my Department's post-primary building unit in Tullamore. Applications for upgrade or replacement of existing IT equipment in schools may be made to my Department's post-primary building unit in Tullamore.</P>
    <P>Schools wishing to take part in the leaving certificate applied (LCA) and restructured leaving certificate vocational programme (LCVP) should apply to my Department's post-primary administration section, Hawkins House, Dublin 2. The schools administration grant is paid on an annual basis to all second level schools within the free education scheme and no individual application is required.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that last month I launched a major new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. This programme will be run over a three year period and will cost £26 million. It involves the creation of 204 new primary teaching posts and the allocation of cash grants to primary schools in respect of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March/April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf. All primary schools were invited to complete the survey questionnaire and over 75% of primary schools participated and returned completed survey forms to the ERC. The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need and all schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in the programme.</P>
      <P>The ERC's records indicate that a questionnaire to apply for inclusion in the new programme was not received from the school referred to by the Deputy. In the absence of a completed survey form from the school, the ERC was unable to assess the level of concentration of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage in relation to the school.</P>
      <P>Where an individual school did not participate in the survey, it may make a submission to my Department outlining its circumstances in relation to educational disadvantage. Such submissions will be referred to the ERC for consideration. The situation of the school will then be further considered.</P>

      <P>The policy unit forms part of my Department's strategic policy directorate established early in 1999. The SPD also encompasses the legal services section, the freedom of information section, the statistics section and the ICT policy unit.</P>
      <P>The role of the policy unit is to advise on key policy issues at all levels of education and to develop appropriate policy initiatives in line with the objectives and strategies set out in my Department's strategy statement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>The current staffing of the policy unit is a principal, an assistant principal, two administrative officers, an executive officer and a clerical officer. The unit reports to the director of strategic policy, who is also responsible for the other elements of the strategic policy directorate listed above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its establishment in its current format, within the strategic policy directorate, two years ago, the policy unit has made an important contribution to the work of my Department and has been involved in a number of significant initiat<Col N="702" /> ives including implementation of various aspects of the Education Act, 1998, enactment of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, and arrangements for its implementation, preparation of the Teaching Council Bill, 2000, which is currently before the Dáil, the White Paper on Early Childhood Education, published in December 1999, the Report of the Commission on the Points System, published in November 1999, the national reading initiative, a one year programme in 2000 to promote reading, reviews of pre-service training for primary and post-primary teachers, which are nearing completion and expenditure reviews at primary level have been completed and they are currently under way at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>During the course of this year, the policy unit will continue work on these and other issues as appropriate. At present the unit is also preparing a new strategy statement for the Department in accordance with the Public Service Management Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>The role and structure of the policy unit was considered by Mr. Seán Cromien, former secretary general of the Department of Finance, as part of his wide ranging review of my Department's operations, systems and staffing needs. Mr. Cromien's report acknowledges the importance of strategic policy development and planning within the Department and makes a number of recommendations with a view to enhancing the effectiveness of the policy unit in this regard. As the House will be aware, I have established a high level task force within my Department to draw up plans for implementing the Cromien report and the recommendations in relation to the policy unit will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>At present tuition is generally free for participants on full-time programmes in further education and at higher education undergraduate level, while students on part-time programmes are charged fees. There are of the order of 1.1 million adults aged 15 to 64 years in Ireland who have less than upper second level education. It is not considered feasible to introduce free education for part-time participants in this group at this stage given the scale of the challenge which is required to promote a framework for lifelong learning. The developments proposed in the White Paper on Adult Education, Learning for Life, provide for large scale increases in adult lit<Col N="703" /> eracy investment, a major expansion of part-time options at further education level, the development of supporting services such as guidance and child care, third level initiatives to promote adult friendly policies and capital and structural investment.</P>
      <P>Given the scale of change needed, the priority is to expand the flexibility of core programmes and services for adults, and to concentrate fee relief for part-time participation on those most at risk. The impact of this policy on the participation of specific groups will be monitored.</P>
      <P>The back to education initiative, under which part-time options for adults in further education are being expanded, provides for free tuition for participants and their dependants who are unemployed, in receipt of medical cards, means tested welfare payments or family income supplements. In addition, a reduction to 30% of tuition costs is provided for unwaged students with less than upper second level education, while the remaining part-time students will be charged fees. The person to whom the Deputy refers does not qualify for fee relief under the new initiative.</P>
      <P>However, grants are paid each year to vocational education committees under the special initiatives for disadvantaged adults scheme under which flexible supports may be provided on a discretionary basis to enable disadvantaged students to participate in courses free or at nominal cost. It is understood that the person involved in this case has recently agreed to provide information to the Kerry Education Service that would help establish her eligibility for assistance under this scheme.</P>
      <P>The fee quoted has been calculated on the basis of £2 per hour and is in keeping with charges elsewhere across the system towards delivery costs.</P>

      <P>Inclusiveness and transparency are core principles underpinning the certificate examinations. Last year the examinations were made more inclusive by allowing a student, depending on his/her special need, have his/her result in a subject based upon all except some element of the examination in that subject. I can assure the Deputy that in all such cases the grade awarded is a full and accurate reflection of the candidate's performance in the examination and the examination certificates issued by my Department state that unequivocally.</P>
      <P>This new measure enables a candidate to obtain maximum marks for the subject even though his/her special need precludes him/her from demonstrating attainment in core elements of the standard assessment. As such it discriminates in favour of the special needs candidate by allowing him/her a waiver not available to candidates generally.</P>
      <P>The change made last year aligns our examination system with best international practice where changes to standard assessment that arise as a result of granting the assistance of readers and scribes are enabled by including an explanatory note on the examination certificate. Furthermore, I wish to confirm that there are subjects where granting the assistance of a scribe or a tape recorder does not significantly alter the standard assessment and therefore the inclusion of an explanatory note is not necessary.</P>
      <P>I can also assure the Deputy that the explanatory note, when included, does not make any reference to a candidate's disability or special need. It does no more than provide factual information on how the standard national assessment was modified to facilitate the candidate.</P>

      <P>While it would be inappropriate to make further comment on this matter while the Labour Court process continues, I must reiterate that contingency plans continue to be developed, firmly based on the maintenance of the principles of quality and integrity.</P>

    <P>I again emphasise that a resolution of the dispute remains my top priority. Preparation of alternative arrangements is simply prudent in the <Col N="711" /> interests of the students.

All parties should await the outcome of the Labour Court's examination and give full consideration to its recommendations when they are received.</P>
      <P>There is an agreed conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers through which issues affecting the pay and conditions of service of teachers are processed. Issues are discussed at a Teachers' </P>

      <P>Ongoing responsibility for maintenance and refurbishment in schools rests with the school authorities, that is the manager of the school or the relevant VEC. Funding for this purpose is provided to schools as part of the annual capitation grants.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the significant improvement in the level of capitation grants since 1997. The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools has been increased from £45 per pupil to £75.50 in the current school year. A rate of £80 will apply in the 2000/2001 school year. This represents an increase of some 77% over four years. These increases in the capitation grant constitute important steps in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.</P>
      <P>At second level, the <i>per capita</i> grant was increased by £8 from September last and now stands at £192 per pupil. It will be significantly increased by £10 to £202 for the next school year. For a school with 500 pupils this amounts to an extra £12,500 per annum and a total capitation grant of £101,000 towards general expenses. An additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 per pupil is payable to disadvantaged schools. Accordingly, this increase will bring the overall <i>per capita</i> payment to £232, thereby bringing the total grant in the case of such a school with 500 pupils to £116,000. Budgets for VEC and C&amp;C schools are increased on a <i>pro rata</i> basis with increases in the <i>per capita</i> grant.</P>
      <P>It is also open to school authorities or the relevant vocational education committees to apply to the Department's building unit for additional capital funding for improvement works. In such cases resources are allocated as circumstances warrant.</P>
      <P>The increases in the capitation grant referred to above constitute a meaningful response to the funding issues involved. I am committed to improving further the funding position of schools in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Since September 1999 the remedial teaching service has been extended to all primary schools with a pupil-teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil-teacher ratios may also seek remedial support from my Department where the level of their particular need warrants such a service. At present there are 1,478 remedial teaching posts allocated to primary schools.</P>
      <P>All second level schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education since the beginning of the 1999-00 school year. The general position is that schools with enrolments of 600 or more pupils are allocated a full post; schools with enrolments below 600 pupils are allocated a post. Schools with enrolments below 600 which were specifically allocated a full post in respect of remedial education by my Department prior to the 1999-00 school year retain their entitlement to an allocation of a full post. The total allocation to second level schools in respect of remedial education in the current year is of the order of 560 whole-time teacher equivalents.</P>
      <P>Under present arrangements, resource teachers are allocated where there are children with special educational needs arising from a disability who are fully integrated into mainstream primary and second level schools and where there are no other adequate teaching resources available to the children. The eligibility of each child and the degree of need are established following consideration of reports on assessments carried out by professionals.</P>
      <P>My Department is continuing to extend the resource teaching service in response to assessed needs.  The total number of resource posts currently allocated to primary and second level schools throughout the country is of the order of 750 and 273 respectively.</P>
